Banglay IELTS July 21, 2025 No Comments অনেকেই বলে, IELTS Reading পরীক্ষায় সময় যেন একদম উড়ে যায়। মাত্র ৬০ মিনিট সময়, আর তাতে ৩টা বড় প্যাসেজ আর ৪০টা প্রশ্ন! শুরুটা ভালো হলেও অনেক সময় দেখা যায়, শেষ প্যাসেজে এসে আর সময় থাকে না। যারা Reading -এ Band 8.0 পেতে চান, তাদের জন্য সবচেয়ে বড় চ্যালেঞ্জটাই হচ্ছে সময় ঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার করা। ✔ Time Management কেন দরকার? অনেক সময় দেখা যায়, কেউ ভালো পড়তে পারে, কিন্তু সময় কম পড়ে যাওয়ায় প্রশ্নগুলোর উত্তর ঠিকভাবে দিতে পারে না। তখন ভুল হয় বেশি, আর কাঙ্ক্ষিত স্কোরটা আর পাওয়া যায় না। Reading -এ ভালো করতে হলে শুধু ইংরেজি জানলেই হবে না, সময় কিভাবে কাজে লাগাতে হবে, সেটাও জানতে হবে। ✔ Time Management-এর সহজ কিছু উপায়- ১. প্রতিটি প্যাসেজের জন্য সময় ভাগ করে নিন তিনটি প্যাসেজের জন্য আপনি চাইলে ২০ মিনিট করে ভাগ করে নিতে পারেন। তবে প্রথম দুইটা প্যাসেজ একটু সহজ হয়, সেগুলো চেষ্টা করুন ১৫-১৭ মিনিটে শেষ করতে। তাহলে শেষের কঠিন প্যাসেজে বেশি সময় পাবেন। ২. Skimming আর Scanning প্র্যাকটিস করুন- প্যাসেজের প্রতিটি শব্দ পড়ার দরকার নেই। চোখ বুলিয়ে দ্রুত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ তথ্য খুঁজে বের করার জন্য Skimming আর Scanning ব্যবহার করুন। এতে সময়ও বাঁচবে, উত্তর খুঁজতেও সুবিধা হবে। ৩. টাইম দিয়ে প্র্যাকটিস করুন- প্রতিদিন একটা করে Reading সেট নিন, ঘড়ি ধরে সময় বেঁধে সমাধান করার অভ্যাস করুন। এতে করে আপনি বুঝতে পারবেন কোন জায়গায় বেশি সময় নিচ্ছেন। ৪. যেটা কঠিন লাগবে, সেটায় আটকে থাকবেন না- Reading -এ এমন অনেক প্রশ্ন থাকে যেগুলোর উত্তর খুঁজে পাওয়া কঠিন হয়। সেগুলোতে বেশি সময় নষ্ট না করে পরের প্রশ্নে যান। পরে সময় থাকলে আবার ফিরে আসবেন। ✔ কীভাবে প্রস্তুতি নেবেন? * প্রথমে ভালোভাবে বুঝে নিন IELTS Reading এর ফরম্যাটটা কেমন। * প্রতিদিন চেষ্টা করুন একটা করে Reading Practice সমাধান করতে। * কোথায় কোথায় সময় বেশি লাগছে, খেয়াল রাখুন। * যেসব প্রশ্নে ভুল হচ্ছে, সেগুলো দেখে বুঝে নিন কেন ভুল হচ্ছে। Reading -এ ভালো করতে হলে regular practice, consistency, patience আর একটা good strategy লাগবে। সময়কে যদি ঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার করতে পারেন, তাহলে Band 8.0 পাওয়াটা কঠিন কিছু নয়। ✔ For Further Guidelines: Website: http://banglayielts.com/ Online Batch: 01303537667 Offline Batch: 01329719503✔ YouTube Channel For FREE Resources:https://www.youtube.com/BanglayIelTS Share it Now Popular Post ⏲ 21 Jul 2025 ✎Banglay IELTS IELTS Reading এ ৮কানোর আটকানোর ভয় আর নয়!

IELTS পরীক্ষার মধ্যে Writing module অনেকের কাছেই সবচেয়ে চ্যালেঞ্জিং। অনেক শিক্ষার্থী ভাবে, শুধু মুখস্থ করে বা কিছু গাইডলাইন মুখে মুখে শিখে নিলেই ভালো স্কোর সম্ভব। কিন্তু বাস্তবতা একেবারেই ভিন্ন। শুধু মুখস্থবিদ্যা দিয়ে IELTS Writing-এ ভালো করা যায় না। কারণ, এই অংশে পরীক্ষার্থীকে নিজের চিন্তাভাবনা, বিশ্লেষণক্ষমতা এবং যুক্তির স্পষ্ট প্রকাশ করতে হয়। আর সেগুলো করতে হলে দরকার Regular Practice ও Proper Guideline। কেন IELTS Writing আলাদা? IELTS Writing Task 1 ও Task 2 'তে আলাদা ধরনের দক্ষতা প্রয়োজন: ১. Task 1 (Academic): চার্ট, গ্রাফ, টেবিল ইত্যাদির বর্ণনা ২. Task 1 (General): চিঠি লেখা ৩. Task 2 (উভয় ধরণের জন্যই): একটি নির্দিষ্ট বিষয়ে মতামত ভিত্তিক বা সমস্যাভিত্তিক Essay লেখা এই অংশগুলোতে উচ্চ মানের Vocabulary, Sentence Structure, Coherence ও Cohesion দরকার। শুধু মুখস্থ কিছু vocabulary বা template ব্যবহার করলেই examiner সন্তুষ্ট হবেন না। প্রতিটি লাইনে থাকবে আপনার বিশ্লেষণী ক্ষমতা এবং ভাষার যথার্থ ব্যবহার। কোথায় বেশি ভুল হয়? ১. মুখস্থ করা template সব লেখায় ব্যবহার করা ২. প্রশ্ন ভালো করে না বোঝা ৩. উদাহরণ না দেওয়া বা topic থেকে বাইরে চলে যাওয়া ৪. সঠিক structure না মেনে লেখা ৫. Grammar ও spelling ভুলে ভরা লেখা তাহলে কী করতে হবে? ১. প্রতিদিন একটু করে অনুশীলন করুন ২. প্রতিটি লেখা শেষে feedback নিন ৩. ভালো Writing Band পাওয়া শিক্ষার্থীদের লেখা পড়ে শিখুন ৪. Vocabulary এবং linking words সঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার করুন ৫. নিজের লেখা বারবার edit করে উন্নত করার অভ্যাস গড়ে তুলুন Writing-এ ভালো করতে চাইলে কী দরকার? সঠিক গাইডলাইন, বাস্তবধর্মী অনুশীলন এবং একজন অভিজ্ঞ মেন্টরের পর্যবেক্ষণই আপনাকে Writing module-এ এগিয়ে রাখবে। Banglay IELTS-এ আপনি পাবেন IELTS Writing নিয়ে step-by-step preparation, model answer, feedback system এবং Real IELTS exam Environment-এর অভিজ্ঞতা। Writing Module নিয়ে ভয় দূর করতে রাশেদ ভাইয়ের এই ভিডিওগুলো দেখুন: বিস্তারিত জানতে ভিজিট করুন:📌 Banglay IELTS Website:https://banglayielts.com/📌 BIIC Website:https://biic.com.bd/আপনার লেখা, আপনার ভাবনা, আপনার লক্ষ্য সবকিছুই মূল্যবান Share it Now Popular Post 21 Jul 2025 IELTS Reading এ ৮কানোর আটকানোর ভয় আর নয়!

That’s why English Language Proficiency (ELP) tests like PTE are so important. Among the available options, the Pearson Test of English (PTE) is becoming more popular for its quick results, fair scoring, and real-life testing approach. In this blog, you’ll learn what the PTE is, how it works, and why many students prefer it. What is PTE? The Pearson Test of English (PTE) is a fully computer-based English test that measures your ability to speak, write, read, and understand English. It reflects real-life academic and workplace situations, making it useful for students and professionals. The test takes around 2 hours and is completed in one sitting at an authorized test centre. Why Choose PTE? PTE gives you a modern, digital testing experience. Instead of writing on paper or speaking to a person, you speak to a computer, respond to audio and video, and write essays. These are similar to tasks you might do at a university or in a job abroad. One big advantage is fast results. Most test-takers receive their scores within 48 hours. Since the scoring is fully automated, results are fair and free from human bias. PTE Exam Format The PTE Academic exam is divided into three main sections:1. Speaking Writing (54–67 minutes) - You’ll complete tasks that test your spoken fluency and written communication. There are 7 types of questions. 2. Reading (29–30 minutes) - You’ll answer multiple-choice questions, fill in blanks, and reorder paragraphs. 3. Listening (30–43 minutes) - You’ll listen to audio clips and respond to questions based on what you heard. Types of PTE Tests - PTE offers two main test versions. Here's a simple comparison:✱ Features - 1. PTE Academic 2. PTE General✱ Focus -Academic English Everyday English ✱ Purpose -University, visa applications Immigration, general use ✱ Content -Lectures, essays, academic tasks Conversations, emails, daily tasks ✱ Scoring -CEFR scale (A1–C2) Similar to IELTS General Training Understanding Your PTE Score Report Your PTE Score Report will be available within 48 hours after the exam. It includes: 1. Overall Score (10–90): Shows your overall English ability 2. Skill Scores: Includes scores for speaking, writing, reading, and listeningThis helps you understand your strengths and where you need to improve. What Does Your Score Mean? PTE Score CEFR Level Description 85–90 C2 Expert 76–84 C1 Advanced 59-75 B2 Upper Intermediate 43-58 B1 Intermediate 30-42 A2 Basic 10-29 A1 Beginner Comparing PTE Scores to PTE and IELTS - PTE Score IELTS Band PTE Score IELTS Band 23-28 4.5 29-35 5.0 36-45 5.5 46-55 6.0 56-65 6.5 66-75 7.0 76-83 7.5 84-88 8.0 89-90 8.5 How Is PTE Scored? PTE scoring combines automated scoring and human review for some tasks. There are two scoring methods: 1. Correct/Incorrect: Full marks for correct answers, no penalty for wrong ones 2. Partial Credit: Marks depend on how well you perform (for example, in essays or speaking tasks) Section-Wise Scoring Details - 1. Reading You’ll be tested on vocabulary, grammar, and understanding of written text through tasks like fill-in-the-blanks and paragraph reordering. 2. Listening This section checks your listening skills, spelling, summarization, and understanding of accents through audio or video clips. 3. Speaking Writing You’ll read aloud, repeat sentences, describe images, write essays, and more. Scoring is based on grammar, fluency, pronunciation, and how well you answer each task. Where is PTE Accepted? PTE scores are accepted in many countries for study and immigration, including: * Australia * Canada * USA * UK * New Zealand * Ireland * Singapore * Germany * Bangladesh * And many more Always check your institution’s requirements before applying. The PTE exam is a smart choice for students and professionals who want a fair, fast, and flexible English test.

This guide provides comprehensive speaking tips for IELTS that will help you approach the test with confidence. Understanding the IELTS Speaking Test Structure The IELTS speaking test is separated into three different parts: Part 1: Introduction and Interview In this section, the examiner will introduce themselves and ask you to do the same. You will respond to general questions concerning you, your home, family, education, job, and hobbies. This part takes about four to five minutes. Part 2: Long Turn When you receive a topic on a task card, you will be given sixty seconds to prepare for it. You are required to speak about that topic for a maximum of two minutes. Following your speech, the examiner can ask one or two questions concerning that topic. The complete time for this section is three to four minutes. Part 3: Discussion This part comprises more theoretical elements and the examiner on more abstract concepts and issues related to the topic in Part 2. This conversation between the examiner and the candidate is debated for four to five minutes. Top Speaking Tips for IELTS 1. Enhance English Fluency and Coherence Speaking fluently and coherently is one of the most important things you can do if you want to do well in the IELTS speaking test. It means that your ideas are expressed clearly and logically. The best way to build up your English is to engage in the habit of speaking it daily, especially with regard to how ideas are linked smoothly without pauses that are unnecessary. 2. Expand Your Word Bank or Vocabulary Improving your vocabulary will help you express your ideas more effectively. Study word synonyms, idiomatic expressions and some phrases connected to common IELTS topics. 3. Enhance Your Pronunciation Clear pronunciation matters a lot. Focus on the sounds of English, rhythm, intonation, and stress patterns. To improve your pronunciation you can turn to online resources or language apps or study with the help of a tutor. 4. Listen and Respond Listen to the examiner carefully during the test. Answer straight away. It is absolutely fine to ask the examiner to repeat or explain a question you did not get. 5. Practice Time Management You nee­d to be mindful of time when spe­aking, thus, practicing in a strict time frame is recomme­nded. Organize your response­s to mirror the completion of each te­st part. For the second part, capitalize on the­ preparation time for brainstorming and arranging your sente­nces prior to verbally prese­nting them. Techniques for Each Part of the IELTS Speaking Test Introduction and Interview Tips Be yourself: Treat this part like a chat with a friend as it is a part of a conversation. Try to relax by smiling. Provide Thorough Answers: Avoid one-word answers, and instead, put details into your opinions to let your language abilities be seen. Do Use Varied Tenses: Reflect your versatility in grammar through the use of other tenses that are appropriate. Long Turn Tips Take Notes: Use the one-minute preparation time to note down the key points you want to discuss. Organize Your Talk: Start with an introduction, then list the main ideas, and finally end with a summary. Keep in Mind What Was Asked: Be sure that your talk does not deviate from the task card s main topic. Discussion Tips Think Critically: This part estimates your skill to evaluate and support your opinions. Consider both perspectives of a situation. Give Examples: Back up your points with examples you have encountered or your general knowledge of a topic. Participate in the Talk: React to the examiner s prompts and then also try to bring in the discussion further with your inputs. Overcoming Common Challenges Nervousness Fee­ling nervous is completely normal. The­ key to boosting comfort in English is consistent practice­. Deep breathing can he­lp calm your nerves effe­ctively. Lack of Ideas Sign up to stay regularly updated about current news and discuss such topics. This will enable you to expand your wisdom tremendously. Always reading the news, watching news, and joining the discussion, and participating in the debate topics will help you to develop a repertoire of ideas. Making Mistakes Don’t worry if you make mistakes. Correcting yourself shows self-awareness. Focus on continuing your response smoothly rather than dwelling on errors. Final Preparation Tips Mock Tests: Take full-length practice tests under exam conditions to get used to the format and timing. Feedback: Seek feedback from teachers, tutors, or language partners to identify areas for improvement. Stay Healthy: Ensure you get enough rest before the test day, eat a healthy meal, and stay hydrated. By following these IELTS speaking tips, you can improve your performance and approach the test with greater confidence. Remember, consistent practice and a positive mindset are key to mastering the IELTS speaking exam.",

      "content_clean": "Questions 1-4: (TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN): Question 1: There may be genetic causes for the differences in how young the skin of identical twins looks. Keywords: may be, genetic cause, differences, young, skin, Now, in the first paragraph, line 8-11. “Any differences between them – one twin having younger looking skin, for example – must be due to environmental factors such as less time spent in the sun.” It means the differences are because of the environment, not for genetic causes. Answer: FALSE Question 2: Twins are at greater risk of developing certain illnesses than non-twins. Keywords: greater risk, developing certain illnesses, Now, in the second paragraph, “If identical twins are more similar to each other with respect to an ailment than fraternal twins are, then vulnerability to the disease must be rooted at least in part in heredity. Unfortunately, the sentence starts with ‘if’, which means the writer only compares identical twins with fraternal twins, he doesn’t make a comparison between twins and non-twins. Answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 3: Bouchard advertised in newspapers for twins who had been separated at birth. Keywords: Bouchard, advertised, newspapers, Now, in paragraph 3 and 4, we find reference to the groundbreaking research on twins. However, nowhere in the paragraph we find any reference to advertisement in newspapers. Answer: NOT GIVEN Question 4: Epigenetic processes are different from both genetic and environmental processes. Keywords: Epigenetic, different from, genetic and environmental, Now, inn paragraph 6, “… .. .nature and nurture are not the only elemental forces at work. According to a recent field called epigenetics, there is a third factor also in play, one that in some cases serves as a bridge between the environment and our genes.” In the previous paragraphs, genetic and environmental processes (nature and nurture) have been explained. Now, in paragraph 6 this line means that the epigenetic process works as a bridge between those two processes. It means it is neither a genetic process nor an environmental process. Answer: TRUE Questions 5-9: (Matching statements with a list of researchers) Question 5: invented a term used to distinguish two factors affecting human characteristics Keywords: invented a term, distinguish, characteristics Now, the phrase “invented a term” is synonymous to ‘coined the phrase’. It means saying something special that no one used this way before. Remember the saying, “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” by the greatest boxer Mohammad Ali. He coined the phrase. So, for this question, we need to find ‘coined the phrase’ and we find it in paragraph no. 4. Here, the writer says, “The idea of using twins to measure the influence of heredity dates back to 1875, when the English scientist Francis Galton first suggested the approach (and coined the phrase ‘nature and nurture’.)” Answer: A (Francis Galton) Question 6: expressed the view that the study of epigenetics will increase our knowledge Keywords: study of epigenetics, will increase, knowledge Now, in paragraph 12 lines 1-3. Here, we find the comments or views of Geneticist Danielle Reed. “Reed adds, the latest work in epigenetics promises to take our understanding even further”. This means that Reed is hopeful that the study of epigenetics will give us a better understanding or knowledge. Answer: C (Danielle Reed) Question 7: developed a mathematical method of measuring genetic influences. Keywords: developed, mathematical method, measuring genetic influences Now, in paragraph 5, “Bouchard and his colleagues used this mountain of data to identify how far twins were affected by their genetic makeup. The key to their approach was a statistical concept called heritability. In broad terms, the heritability of a trait measures the extent to which differences among members of a population can be explained by differences in their genetics”. Here, statistical concept = mathematical method Answer: B (Thomas Bouchard) Question 8: pioneered research into genetics using twins Keywords: pioneered, research, genetics, twins Now, in paragraph 4 line 1-4, “The idea of using twins to measure the influence of heredity dates back to 1875, when the English scientist Francis Galton first suggested the approach. .. . . .”. Here, the phrase “first suggested” means that Francis Galton was the first person or the pioneer to use twins to measure the influence of heredity. Answer: A (Francis Galton) Question 9: carried out research into twins who had lived apart Keywords: carried out, research, twins who had lived apart, Now, find the Keyword ‘twins who had lived apart’ which can be found in paragraph no. 4, lines 6-10, “… .. twin studies took a surprising twist in the 1980s, with the arrival of studies into identical twins who had been separated at birth and reunited as adults. Over two decades 137 sets of twins eventually visited Thomas Bouchard’s lab….” Answer: B (Thomas Bouchard) Question 10-13: (Summary completion using the list of words) Question 10 and 11: In epigenetic processes, 10 __________ influence the activity of our genes, for example in creating our internal 11 ____________. Keywords: epigenetic process, influence, activity of our genes, creating, our internal, Now, in paragraph 7. You need to read the whole paragraph. In line 1 and 2, what epigenetic processes are. “Epigenetic processes are chemical reactions .. .. . ..” Then in the last few lines of the paragraph, the writer explains what these chemical reactions influence, “These reactions influence how our genetic code is expressed: how each gene is strengthened or weakened; even turned on or off, to build our bones, brains and all other parts of our bodies.” So, it can be deduced or realized from these lines that ‘chemical’ reactions influence how our internal body parts are created such as ‘our bones, brains’ etc. Answers: 10. D (chemicals); 11. B (organs) Question 12: The study of epigenetic processes is uncovering a way in which our genes can be affected by our ________. Keywords: uncovering a way, our genes can be affected, Now, in paragraph 9, lines 1-5, “One way the study of epigenetics is revolutionizing our understanding of biology is by revealing a mechanism by which the environment directly impacts our genes.” Here, the word ‘impact’ is synonymous to ‘affected’, ‘revealing’ is synonymous to ‘uncovering a way’. Answer: E (environment), Question 13: One example is that if a pregnant rat suffers stress, the new-born rat may show problems in its ____________. Keywords: pregnant rat, suffers stress, Now, in paragraph 9, lines 5-9, “Studies of animals, for example, have shown that when a rat experiences stress during pregnancy, it can cause epigenetic changes in a fetus that lead to behavioral problems as the rodent grows up.” Answer: F (behavior/ behavior) Questions 14-20: (Multiple Choice Questions): General Idea: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not to understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence. Question 14: In the first paragraph, the writer makes a point that Keywords: No keywords Now, in the first paragraph, the author describes the importance of sound in lines 1-4, at the very opening of the paragraph, “Though we might think of film as an essentially visual experience, we really cannot afford to underestimate the importance of film sound.” Here, the word ‘underestimate’ means ‘overlook’. After that, the author also gives details of how important film sound is. So, he makes a point that it would be wrong to overlook the contribution of sound to the artistry of films. Answer: B (it would be wrong to overlook the contribution of sound to the artistry of films.) Question 15: One reason that the writer refers to Humphrey Bogart is to exemplify Keywords: Humphrey Bogart, exemplify, Now, in paragraph 2, the author gives reference to Humphrey Bogert in lines 4-10, “Often with film characterization, the audience perceives little or no difference between the character and the actor. Thus, for example, the actor Humphrey Bogart is the character Sam Spade; film personality and life personality seem to merge.” Here, merge = become one; This clearly means that Humphrey Bogart is mentioned to exemplify the significance of the actor and the character appears to have similar personalities. Answer: A (the importance of the actor and the character appearing to have similar personalities.) Question 16: In the third paragraph, the writer suggests that Keywords: No keywords Now, in paragraph 3, line 6-12, the writer mentions the use of dialogues, “It is interesting to note that how dialogue is use and the very amount of dialogue used varies widely among films. For example, in the highly successful science-fiction film 2001, little dialogue was evident, and most of it was banal and of little intrinsic interest.” Here, banal means dull or boring; Answer: B (film dialogue that appears to be dull may have a specific purpose.) Question 17: What does the writer suggest about Bringing Up Baby? Keywords: suggest, Bringing Up Baby, Now, in the beginning of paragraph 4, line 1-8. Here, the author says, “The comedy Bringing Up Baby, on the other hand, presents practically non-stop dialogue delivered at breakneck speed. This use of dialogue underscores not only the dizzy quality of the character Katherine Hepburn, but also the absurdity of the film itself and thus its humor.” These lines suggest that the dialogue in the film Bringing Up Baby highlights key elements of the film. Here, key elements = the absurdity of the humor of the film; Answer: D (The nature of the dialogue emphasizes key elements of the film.) Question 18: The writer refers to the ‘click’ of a door to make the point that realistic sounds Keywords: click of a door, realistic sounds Now, the word ‘click’ sound in paragraph 5, line 6-19, the author says, “Synchronous sounds contribute to the realism of film and also help to create a particular atmosphere. For example, the ‘click’ of a door being opened may simply serve to convince the audience that the image portrayed is real, and the audience may only subconsciously note the expected sound. However, if the ‘click’ of an opening door is part of an ominous action such as a burglary, the sound mixer may call attention to the ‘click’ with an increase in volume; this helps to engage the audience in a moment of suspense.” These lines suggest that realistic sounds can be modified by increasing the sound volume to make it more realistic. Answer: C (may be modified in order to manipulate the audience’s response to the film.) Question 19-23: (TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN): Question 19: Audiences are likely to be surprised if a film lacks background music. Keywords: audiences, likely to be surprised, film lack background music Now, in the very beginning of paragraph 7, the writer says that “We are probably all familiar with background music in films, which has become so ubiquitous as to be noticeable in its absence.” Here, ubiquitous = ever-present; This means background sound or music has become an essential part of films. So, there is a high possibility that the audience will surely notice it and be surprised if background music is absent from a film. Answer: TRUE Question 20: Background music may anticipate a development in a film. Keywords: anticipate, development Now, in paragraph no. , in the end, “In addition, background music often foreshadows a change in mood.” Here, the word ‘foreshadow’ is synonymous to ‘anticipate’. This means the background music can make the audience understand what changes are going to happen in a film. Answer: TRUE Question 21: Background music has more effect on some people than on others. Keywords: more effect, some people than on others Now, find the reference to ‘background music’ and its effects in both paragraphs no. 7 and 8. But we cannot find any comparison as to whether it has more or less effect on some people. Answer: NOT GIVEN Question 22: Background music may help the audience to make certain connections within the film. Keywords: help the audience, make certain connections Now, in lines 1 and 2 of paragraph no. 8, “Background music may aid viewer understanding by linking scenes.” Here, help means aid, audience means viewer, make connections within a film means linking scenes; Answer: TRUE Question 23: Audiences tend to be aware of how the background music is affecting them. Keywords: audiences, tend to, be aware, how, affecting, Now, in the final paragraph, “The effects of sound are often largely subtle and often are noted by only our subconscious minds.” Here, subtle means delicate or faint or slight; So, audiences aren’t truly aware of the background music’s effect. Rather, subconscious mind takes note of it. Answer: FALSE Question 24-26: (Completing sentences with correct ending) Question 24: The audience’s response to different parts of a film can be controlled Keywords: response, different parts, controlled Now, in paragraph no. 1, lines 8-13, “The entire sound track consists of three essential ingredients: the human voice, sound effects and music. These three tracks must be mixed and balanced so as to produce the necessary emphases which in turn create desired effects”. The lines mean that the response or reaction of the audience can be influenced if voice, sound, and music are appropriately combined. Here, combined appropriately means mixed and balanced. Answer: C Question 25: The feelings and motivations of characters become clear Keywords: feelings, motivation, clear Now, in paragraph 2, lines 1-4, “… . As is the case with stage drama, dialogue serves to tell the story and expresses feelings and motivations of characters as well.” This means that listening to dialogues clarifies the feelings and motivations of characters in the film. Answer: A Question 26: A character seems to be a real person rather than an actor Keywords: seems to be real person, than actor Now, in paragraph 3, lines 1-3, “When voice textures fit the performer’s physiognomy and gestures, a whole and very realistic person emerges.” Here, actor means performer, appearance means physiognomy, moves means gestures, consistent with means fit; These lines suggest that a character appears to be a real person rather than an actor given to the fact that the audience listens to the voice, looks at the appearance of the character and watches how he/she moves. Answer: E Questions 27-32: (List of headings/ Matching Headlines) Question 27: Paragraph A Now, in paragraph A, we find two different lines which confirm our answer. The first line is line no. 1 which says, “Of all mankind’s manifold creations, language must take pride of place.” The second line is line no. 3 which says, “… Compared to language, all other inventions pale in significance, since … … . .” These two lines explain that language is the best invention of all. Answer: vi (Why language is the most important invention of all) Question 28: Paragraph B Now, in paragraph B, again, the first and last lines give us the answer. Line 1 2 says, “.. . . . In its own right it is a tool of extraordinary sophistication, yet based on an idea of ingenious simplicity: . . ..” Here, the writer gives us the impression that language is something that is special (extraordinary sophistication) yet it is of an idea which may surprise us because of the creative simplicity (ingenious simplicity), and this is why it is incompatible or mismatched. Also, take a look at the last lines, “Language is mankind’s greatest invention – except, of course, that it was never invented. This apparent paradox is at the core of our fascination with language, and it holds many of its secrets.” Here, paradox = irony or contradiction or mismatched. Answer: iv (Apparently incompatible characteristics of language) Question 29: Paragraph C Now, in paragraph C, first, the writer asks in line 2-3, “How else could this instrument make so much out of barely three dozen measly morsels of sound?” Then, we find in the next few lines the explanations of how the alphabets or letters work out by arranging themselves to make perfect sounds that can be conveyed into a language. “In themselves, these configurations of mouth – p, f, b, v, t, d, k, sh, a, e and so on – amount to nothing .. . . . . . But run them through the cogs and wheels of the language machine, let it arrange them in some very special orders, and there is nothing that these meaningless streams of air cannot do: from sighing the interminable boredom of existence to unravelling the fundamental order of the universe.” Here, barely three dozen measly morsels of sound = a few sounds Answer: ii (The way in which a few sounds are organised to convey a huge range of meaning) Question 30: Paragraph D Now, in paragraph D, the writer talks about the universal or worldwide or common ability to use language “The language machine allows just about everybody – from pre-modern foragers in the subtropical savannah, to post-modern philosophers in the suburban sprawl – to tie these meaningless sounds together into an infinite variety of subtle senses, and all apparently without the slightest exertion.” This means that language is universal to use. Answer: vii (The universal ability to use language) Question 31: Paragraph E Now, in paragraph E, the writer states, “Often, it is the only estrangement of foreign tongues, with their many exotic and outlandish features, that brings home the wonder of language’s design.” This means the more a language is different from other language, the more it becomes impressive. The writer also provides the example of a Turkish word of outstanding length that takes a whole sentence to utter in English. Answer: i (Differences between languages highlight their impressiveness) Question 32: Paragraph F Now, in paragraph F, the answer is found in lines 8-9, “… . . . . even the absence of a sound has been enlisted to express something specific.” Here, the absence of a sound = silence, specific = meaningful; Answer: v (Even silence can be meaningful) Questions 33-36: (Summary completion with the given list of words) Title of the summary: The importance of language Question 33 and 34: The wheel is one invention that has had a major impact on __________ aspects of life, but no impact has been as _________ as that of language. Keywords: wheel, invention, impact, aspects Now, in paragraph A, the writer states about the inventions like wheel, “Other inventions – the wheel, agriculture, sliced bread – may have transformed our material existence, but the advent of language is what made us human. Compared to language, all other inventions pale in significance, since everything we have ever achieved depends on language and originates from it.” These lines suggest that the invention of wheel has had a major impact on material aspects of life, but such impacts has not been as significant or fundamental as that of language, because all other inventions save originated from language. Answers: 33. E (material); 34. G (fundamental); Question 35: Language is very _________, yet composed of just a small number of sounds. Keywords: composed, small number of sounds Now, at the beginning of paragraph B, the author states, “In its own right it is a tool of extraordinary sophistication, yet based on an idea of ingenious simplicity: .. .. .” Then in the next lines, the writer talks about the limitation of numbers of sounds, “… this marvelous invention of composing out of twenty-five or thirty sounds that infinite variety of expression . . . .. “ These lines suggest that language is sophisticated or complex but it comes out of only a few sounds. Answer: B (complex) Question 36: Language appears to be ________ to use. However, its sophistication is often overlooked. Keywords: appears, sophistication, overlooked Now, in paragraph D, lines 5-9, the author says, “.. . .. Yet it is precisely this deceptive ease which makes language a victim of its own success since in everyday life its triumphs are usually taken for granted. The wheels of language run so smoothly that one rarely bothers to stop and think about all the resourcefulness and expertise that must have gone into making it tick.” The lines suggest that language provides us ease, and this ease has made people think very little about how sophisticated a language is or how it is being constructed. Answer: F (easy) Questions 36-40 (YES/NO/NOT GIVEN): Question 37: Human beings might have achieved their present position without language. Keywords: human beings, present position, without language Now, in paragraph 1, in the end, “Without language, we could never have embarked on our ascent to unparalleled power over all other animals, and even over nature itself.” So, the statement directly contradicts with the passage. Answer: NO Question 38: The Port-Royal grammarians did justice to the nature of language. Keywords: Port-Royal grammarians, did justice, Now, in paragraph B, “. . .. This was how, in 1660, the renowned French grammarians of the Port-Royal abbey near Versailles distilled the essence of language, and no one since has celebrated more eloquently the magnitude of its achievement.” The lines suggest that the Port-Royal grammarians have most eloquently or beautifully described the essence or nature of language. So, surely they did justice to the nature of language. Answer: YES Question 39: A complex idea can be explained more clearly in a sentence than in a single word. Keywords: complex idea, clearly, sentence Now, we do not find any such statement as to whether a complex idea can be described more easily or clearly than in a single word. The writer refers to the long Turkish word on paragraph E to explain that one word can be expressed to clarify a big sentence. Answer: NOT GIVEN Question 40: The Sumerians were responsible for starting the recording of events. Keywords: Sumerians, recording events Now, in paragraph F, the writer states, “And if that sounds like some one-off freak, then consider Sumerian, the language spoken on the banks of the Euphrates some 5,000 years ago by the people who invented writing and thus enabled the documentation of history.” So, the statement suggests clearly that the Sumerians invented writing and documentation of history. Answer: YES",

      "content_clean": "Facebook Twitter LinkedIn PASSAGE 1: THE COCONUT PALM QUESTIONS 1-8: COMPLETE THE TABLE BELOW. Question 1. TRUNK – TIMBER FOR HOUSES AND THE MAKING OF………. Keywords: trunk, timber, houses, making Now, looking for the key words, we find the reference to the trunk and its uses in paragraph 2. The writer says that: “This is an important source of timber for building houses, and is increasingly being used as a replacement for endangered hardwoods in the furniture construction industry”. Thus, the trunk is used to build houses and also to make furniture. Here, making = construction Answer: furniture. Question 2. FLOWERS – STEMS PROVIDE SAP, USED AS A DRINK OR A SOURCE OF ………. Keywords: flowers, sap, drink, source Now, coconut flowers are also mentioned in paragraph 2: “The flower stems may be tapped for their sap to produce a drink, and the sap can also be reduced by boiling to produce a type of sugar used for cooking”. Thus, the sap from the flower stems can be used as a drink or to boil and make a kind of sugar. Answer: sugar. Question 3. FRUITS – MIDDLE LAYER (COIR FIBRES) USED FOR ………. , ETC Keywords: fruits, middle, coir fibres Now, look for the information relating to fruits, and we find this in paragraph 3: “The thick fibrous middle layer produces coconut fibre, coir, which has numerous uses and is particularly important in manufacturing ropes”. So, the fibre from the middle layer, coir, is used to make ropes., Answer: ropes. Question 4. FRUITS – INNER LAYER (SHELL): A SOURCE OF ………. Keywords: inner, shell, source Now, at the end of paragraph 3, the uses of the ‘woody inner layer’ of coconut shells are described: “An important product obtained from the shell is charcoal, which is widely used in various industries…” The inner layer of the shell, therefore, provides charcoal for industries and also for cooking. Answer: charcoal. Question 5. FRUITS – INNER LAYER (SHELL): WHEN HALVED USED FOR ………. Keywords: inner, shell, halved Now, as we continue reading paragraph 3, the other use of the inner layer – the shell – is mentioned: “When broken in half, the shells are also used as bowls in many parts of Asia”. Halves of shells are used as bowls. Here, halved = broken in half Answer: bowls. Question 6. FRUITS – COCONUT WATER: A SOURCE OF ………. FOR OTHER PLANTS Keywords: coconut water, source, other plants Now, in paragraph 4, we find the uses of coconut water: “…coconut water, which is enjoyed as a drink but also provides the hormones which encourage other plants to grow more rapidly and produced higher yields”. The coconut water provides hormones for other plants, therefore it is a source of hormones for those plants. Answer: hormones. Question 7. FRUITS – COCONUT FLESH: OIL AND MILK FOR COOKING AND ………. Keywords: coconut flesh, oil, milk, cooking The author continues in paragraph 4: “Dried coconut flesh, copra, is made into coconut oil and coconut milk, which are widely used in cooking in different parts of the world, as well as in cosmetics”. Thus, coconut oil and milk are used for cooking and for making cosmetics. Answer: cosmetics. Question 8. FRUITS –COCONUT FLESH: GLYCERINE (AN INGREDIENT IN) ………. Keywords: coconut flesh, glycerine, ingredient It is also stated in paragraph 4 that: “A derivative of coconut fat, glycerine, acquired strategic importance in a quite different sphere, as Alfred Nobel introduced the world to his nitroglycerine-based invention: dynamite”. ‘Nitroglycerine-based means that glycerine was one of the basic ingredients. Nobel’s invention was dynamite. Answer: dynamite. QUESTIONS 9-13: DO THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS AGREE WITH THE INFORMATION GIVEN IN READING PASSAGE 1? Question 9. COCONUT SEEDS NEED SHADE IN ORDER TO GERMINATE Keywords: seeds, shade, germinate Now, these key words can be found in paragraph 5. There, the writer tells us how coconut seeds germinate: “Literally cast onto desert island shores, with little more than sand to grow in and exposed to the full glare of the tropical sun, coconut seeds are able togerminate and root”. ‘Glare’ means to shine with a very bright and unpleasant light – we often wear sunglasses to protect against the glare of the sun. It is the opposite of the shade. So, coconut seeds do not need shade in order to germinate, they can germinate in the sun. Answer: FALSE. Question 10. COCONUTS WERE PROBABLY TRANSPORTED TO ASIA FROM AMERICA IN THE 16TH CENTURY Keywords: transported, Asia, America, 16th century Now, in the last paragraph, the writer tells us about the origins of coconuts. “16th century trade and human migration patterns reveal that Arab traders and European sailors are likely to have moved coconuts from South and Southeast Asia to Africa and then acrossthe Atlantic to the east coast of America”. This sentence tells us that coconuts were probably moved from Asia to America – via Africa. This route is the opposite of the statement. Here,probably = likely. transported = moved. Answer: FALSE. Question 11. COCONUTS FOUND ON THE WEST COAST OF AMERICA WERE A DIFFERENT TYPE FROM THOSE FOUND ON THE EAST COAST Keywords:.west coast, America, different, east coast Now, in the last paragraph, the writer simply tells us that: “In America, there are close coconut relatives, but no evidence that coconuts are indigenous”. Thus, we do not know if the coconuts on the west and east coasts of America are different. Answer: NOT GIVEN. Question 12. ALL THE COCONUTS FOUND IN ASIA ARE CULTIVATED VARIETIES. Keywords: all, Asia, cultivated Now, this information is also given in the last paragraph: “In Asia there is a large degree of coconut diversity and evidence of millennia of human use – but there are no relatives growing in the wild”. As there are no wild coconuts growing in Asia, all the varieties must be cultivated. Here, varieties = relatives, Answer: TRUE. Question 13. COCONUTS ARE CULTIVATED IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN AMERICA AND THE PACIFIC. Keywords: cultivated, different, America, Pacific Now, in the last paragraph. Here, it is stated that: “In America there are close coconut relatives, but no evidence that coconuts are indigenous. These problems have led to the intriguing suggestion that coconuts originated on coral islands in the Pacific and were dispersed from there”. Thus, the only information given here is that the origins of coconuts are not known for certain, but nothing is stated about the methods of cultivation, either in America or the Pacific. Answer: NOT GIVEN. IELTS Cambridge 13, Test 3, Academic Reading Module, Reading Passage 2 PASSAGE 2: How Baby Talk Gives Infant Brains A Boost Questions 14-17. Look at the following ideas (Questions 14-17) and the list of researchers below. Match each idea with the correct researcher. Question 14. THE IMPORTANCE OF ADULTS GIVING BABIES INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION WHEN TALKING TO THEM Keywords: adults, babies, individual attention, talking Now, in paragraph D, the author writes about the study of Nairan Ramirez-Esparza. She says: “We also found that it really matters whether you use baby talk in a one-on-one context…The more parents use baby talk one-on-one, the more babies babble, and the more they babble, the more words they produce later in life”. A ‘one-on-one context’ means a situation in which the parent is alone with the baby, talking to the baby and giving it individual attention. Here, importance = it really matters; individual = one-on-one. Answer: B. Question 15. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT BABIES HEAR AND THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO CREATE SPEECH Keywords: connection, hear, efforts, speech Now, in paragraph F, the author refers to a study in which Patricia Kuhl took part: “The results suggest that listening to baby talk prompts infant brains to start practicing their language skills”. Thus, when babies listen to (= hear) baby talk, this stimulates their brains to try to practice their own language skills. The passage continues: “Finding activation in the motor areas of the brain when infants are simply listening is significant, because it means the baby brain is engaged in trying to talk back right from the start, and suggests that seven-month-olds’ brains are already trying to figure out how to make the right movements that will produce words”. Here, create speech = produce words Answer: C. Question 16.THE ADVANTAGE FOR THE BABY OF HAVING TWO PARENTS EACH SPEAKING IN A DIFFERENT WAY Keywords: advantage, two parents, different way Now, in paragraph C, the author tells us about the study of Mark VanDam. He found that mothers and fathers (the two parents) each spoke to children in a different way: “The idea is that a kid gets to practice a certain kind of speech with mom and another kind of speech with dad, so the kid then has a wider repertoire of kinds of speech to practice”. The advantage for the baby when parent speak in these different ways, is that it grows up having a wider range (= repertoire) of kinds of speech, which it can then practice. Here, a different way = another kind Answer: A. Question 17. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF BABY TALK BABIES HEAR AND HOW MUCH VOCALISING THEY DO THEMSELVES Keywords:connection, amount of baby talk, vocalising Now, in the middle of paragraph D, the author writes about a study which found that “…the more baby talk parents used, the more their youngsters began to babble”. Nairan Ramirez-Esparza adds: “Those children who listened to a lot of baby talk were talking more than the babies that listened to more adult talk or standard speech”. She found, therefore, that there is a connection between the amount of baby talk which babies listened to, and how much talking the babies did. Here, vocalising = babble/ talking. Answer: B. QUESTIONS 18-23: COMPLETE THE SUMMARY. Question 18. RESEARCHERS AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY USED ………………….. , TOGETHER WITH SPECIALISED COMPUTER PROGRAMS, TO ANALYSE HOW PARENTS INTERACTED WITH THEIR BABIES DURING A NORMAL DAY. Keywords: Washington State University, computer programs, interacted, normal day We find a reference to Washington State University in paragraph C. “Mark VanDam of Washington State University at Spokane and colleagues equipped parents with recording devices and speech-recognition software to study the way they interacted with their youngsters during a normal day”. Here, specialised computer programs = speech-recognition software; analyse = study. Answer: recording devices. Question 19. THE STUDY REVEALED THAT ……………….. TENDED NOT TO MODIFY THEIR ORDINARY SPEECH PATTERNS WHEN INTERACTING WITH THEIR BABIES. Keywords: not modify, speech patterns, interacting Now, in paragraph C, VanDam explains: “Dads didn’t raise their pitch or fundamental frequency when they talked to kids”. In other words, fathers spoke to their babies in a similar way that they would speak normally. Their ‘pitch and fundamental frequency’ refers to the ‘ordinary speech patterns’ which fathers use to talk to their babies. Here, interacting with = talked to; babies = kids. Answer: dads/fathers. Question 20. ACCORDING TO AN IDEA KNOWN AS THE ……………….. , THEY MAY USE A MORE ADULT TYPE OF SPEECH TO PREPARE INFANTS FOR THE LANGUAGE THEY WILL HEAR OUTSIDE THE FAMILY HOME. Keywords: idea, adult, speech, prepare, language, outside Now, continuing with the findings of the study in paragraph C, the author says of fathers: “Their role may be rooted in what is called the bridge hypothesis, which dates back to 1975. It suggests that fathers use less familiar language to provide their children with a bridge to the kind of speech they’ll hear in public”. So, the author suggests that fathers may use ‘less familiar’ (= more adult) language to talk to their babies, which helps to prepare these infants for what they will hear when they are not in the family home. Here, idea = hypothesis; language = speech; outside the family home = in public; Answer: bridge hypothesis. Question 21. ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCHERS, HEARING BABY TALK FROM ONE PARENT AND ‘NORMAL’ LANGUAGE FROM THE OTHER EXPANDS THE BABY’S ………………. OF TYPES OF SPEECH WHICH THEY CAN PRACTICE. Keywords: normal language, expands, types of speech Now, we find the answer at the end of paragraph C. We know from the previous question that fathers speak to babies using less ‘baby talk’ and more normal speech, using adult language. “The idea is that a kid gets to practice a certain kind of speech with mom and another kind of speech with dad, so the kid then has a wider repertoire of kinds of speech to practice’, says VanDam”. A repertoire refers to all the things that a person – in this case, a baby – is able to do. So, the baby is able to practice different kinds of speech with each parent. Answer: repertoire. Question 22. MEANWHILE ANOTHER STUDY CARRIED OUT BY SCIENTISTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT RECORDED SPEECH AND SOUND USING SPECIAL …………. THAT THE BABIES WERE EQUIPPED WITH. Keywords: Washington, Connecticut, recorded, equipped Now, in paragraph D, we find a reference to the University of Washington and the University of Connecticut. This enables us to know where to look for the answer: “Scientists from the University of Washington and the University of Connecticut collected thousands of 30-second conversations between parents and their babies, fitting 26 children with audio-recording vests that captured language and sound….”Thus, these scientists recorded the language and sounds, using audio-recording vests fitted to the babies. Here, recorded = captured. Answer: (audio-recording) vests. Question 23. WHEN THEY STUDIED THE BABIES AGAIN AT AGE TWO, THEY FOUND THAT THOSE WHO HAD HEARD A LOT OF BABY TALK IN INFANCY HAD A MUCH LARGER …………… THAN THOSE WHO HAD NOT. Keywords: age two, babies again, larger Now, we now have to find more information on the study conducted by the scientists mentioned in the previous question. Again, the answer is in paragraph D: “And when researchers saw the same babies at age two, they found that frequent baby talk had dramatically boosted vocabulary….” At the age of two, babies who had heard a lot of baby talk, had more vocabulary than those who had not heard much baby talk. Here, a lot of = frequent; had a much larger vocabulary = dramatically boosted vocabulary. Answer: vocabulary. QUESTIONS 24-26: READING PASSAGE 2 HAS SIX PARAGRAPHS, A-F. Question 24. A REFERENCE TO A CHANGE WHICH OCCURS IN BABIES’ BRAIN ACTIVITY BEFORE THE END OF THEIR FIRST YEAR Keywords: change, brain activity, end of first year Now, in paragraph F. The author writes about a publication called Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In this publication, a study was reported which was carried out with babies of 7 months and 11.5 months – in other words, before the end of their first year. “The infants were placed in a brain-activation scanner that recorded activity in a brain region known to guide the motor movements that produce speech. The results suggest that listening to baby talk prompts infant brains to start practicing their language skills”. So, listening to baby talk leads to changes in the activity of ‘infant brains’. Answer: F. Question 25. AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT SOME PARENTS DO FOR THEIR BABY’S BENEFIT BEFORE BIRTH .Keywords:. example, baby’s benefit, before birth The answer can be found in paragraph A. “Most babies start developing their hearing while still in the womb, prompting some hopeful parents to play classical music to their pregnant bellies”. Most babies, therefore, start to hear when they are still inside the body of the mother. So, some parents start to play music for these unborn babies to stimulate their hearing. Here, before birth = still in the womb. Answer: A. Question 26. A MENTION OF BABIES’ PREFERENCE FOR THE SOUNDS THAT OTHER BABIES MAKE Keywords: preference, sounds, other babies Now, at the beginning of paragraph E. “Another study suggests that parents might want to pair their youngsters up so they can babble more with their own kind. Researchers from McGill University and Universite du Quebec a Montreal found that babies seem to like listening to each other rather than adults…” More details of this study are given in the paragraph, and these refer specifically to the sounds made by babies: “…the ‘infant’ sounds held babies’ attention nearly 40 percent longer” than the sounds made by adults. Here, preference = seem to like. Answer: E. QUESTIONS 27-31: READING PASSAGE 3 HAS EIGHT PARAGRAPHS, A-H. Question 27. PROPOSED EXPLANATIONS FOR THE DECLINE OF THE HARAPPAN CIVILISATION Keywords: explanations, decline Now, causes for the decline of the Harappan civilisation are found in paragraph C. There are different suggestions or explanations: changes affecting water supply and agriculture, population growth, a breakdown of trade, invasion and even environmental changes related to climate. “It is unlikely that there was a single cause for the decline of the civilisation”. Here, explanation = cause. Answer: C. Question 28. REFERENCE TO A PRESENT-DAY APPLICATION OF SOME ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH FINDINGS Keywords: present-day application, archaeological, findings Now, the final paragraph relates what we can learn from the archaeological research into the Harappan civilisation to tackle some issues today. “By investigating responses to environmental pressures and threats, we can learn from the past to engage with the public, and the relevant governmental and administrative bodies, to be more proactive in issues such as the management and administration of water supply, the balance of urban and rural development, and the importance of preserving cultural heritage in the future”. Answer: H. Question 29. A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HARAPPAN CIVILISATION AND ANOTHER CULTURE OF THE SAME PERIOD Keywords: difference, another culture, same period The question asks us to look for a comparison between the Harappan civilisation and another particular culture at that same time. The answer is in paragraph A. The people of the Harappan culture did not leave pictures of themselves, “But their lack of self-imagery – at at time when the Eyptians were carving and painting representations of themselves all over their temples – is only part of the mystery”. Thus, a contrast is made between the Harappan civilisation and Egyptian culture at the same period. Answer: A. Question 30. A DESCRIPTION OF SOME FEATURES OF HARAPPAN URBAN DESIGN Keywords: features, urban design Now, in paragraph B, Dr Cameron Petrie describes Harappan cities. They had: “…great baths, craft workshops, palaces and halls laid out in distinct sectors. Houses were arranged in blocks, with wide main streets and narrow alleyways, and many had their own wells and drainage systems”. All of these are features of urban design – things that we find in the sites of Harappan cities. Answer: B. Question 31. REFERENCE TO THE DISCOVERY OF ERRORS MADE BY PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGISTS Keywords: errors, previous archaeologists Now, in paragraph D, we find several references to the mistakes made by previous archaeologists: “…many of the archaeological sites were not where they were supposed to be, completely altering understanding of the way that this region was inhabited in the past. The new research team “…found inaccuracies in the published geographic locations of ancient settlements ranging from several hundred metres to many kilometres”. The result was that “…any attempts to use the existing data were likely to be fundamentally flawed”. All of these are errors of previous archaeologists, discovered by the research team of Dr Petrie and Dr Singh. Answer: D. QUESTIONS 32-36: COMPLETE THE SUMMARY BELOW. Question 32. BY COLLECTING THE …………… OF SNAILS AND ANALYSING THEM, THEY DISCOVERED….. Keywords: collecting, snails, analysing In paragraph E, we find a reference to the research of Yama Dixit and David Hodell. “The researchers gathered shells of Melanoides tuberculata snails from the sediment of an ancient lake and used geochemical analysis as a means of tracing the climate history of the region”. Therefore, the researchers collected and analysed the shells of snails. Here, collect = gather Answer: shells. Question 33. THEY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE OF A CHANGE IN WATER LEVELS IN A ………….. IN THE REGION Keywords: change, water levels Now, in paragraph E, the author continues: “As today, the major source of water into the lake is likely to have been the summer monsoon’, says Dixit. ‘But we have observed that there was an abrupt change about 4,100 years ago, when the amount of evaporation from the lake exceeded the rainfall – indicative of a drought”. About 4,100 years ago, there was a sudden change, when the water level in the lake fell. Answer: lake. Question 34. THIS OCCURRED WHEN THERE WAS LESS ……………. THAN EVAPORATION, AND SUGGESTS THAT THERE WAS AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF DROUGHT Key words: less, evaporation, drought Now, in the same sentence in paragraph E, we find the answer. This is the same period “…when the amount of evaporation exceeded the rainfall – indicative of a drought”. If the evaporation exceeded the rainfall, leading to a drought, this means that there was less rainfall than evaporation. Answer: rainfall. Question 35.PETRIE AND SINGH’S TEAM ARE USING ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORDS TO LOOK AT ………….. FROM FIVE MILLENNIA AGO, IN ORDER TO KNOW WHETHER PEOPLE HAD ADAPTED THEIR AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES TO CHANGING CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. Keywords: Petrie, Singh, records, five millenia ago Now, at the beginning of paragraph G. “Petrie and Singh’s team is now examining archaeological records and trying to understand details of how people led their lives in the region five millennia ago. They are analysing grains cultivated at the time and trying to work out whether they were grown under extreme conditions of water stress, and whether they were adjusting the combinations of crops they were growing for different weather systems”. Here, look at = analyse; adapt = adjust; agricultural practices = combinations of crops; changing climatic conditions = different weather systems. Answer: grains. Question 36. THEY ARE ALSO EXAMINING OBJECTS INCLUDING ……………. , SO AS TO FIND OUT ABOUT LINKS BETWEEN INHABITANTS OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE REGION AND WHETHER THESE CHANGED OVER TIME. Keywords: examining objects, links, inhabitants, changed Now, in paragraph G. The researchers “…are also looking at whether the types of pottery used, and other aspects of their material culture, were distinctive to specific regions or were more similar across larger areas. This gives us insight into the types of interactive networks that the population was involved in, and whether those changed”. Here, look at = examine; links = interactive networks; inhabitants = population. Answer: pottery. QUESTIONS 37-40: LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS AND THE LIST OF RESEARCHERS BELOW. Question 37. FINDING FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN THE REGION IS VITAL Keywords: changes, environmental conditions, vital Now, at the end of paragraph F: “Considering the vast area of the Harappan Civilisation with its variable weather systems’, explains Singh, ‘it is essential that we obtain more climate data from areas close to the two great cities at Mohenjodaro and Harappa and also from the Indian Punjab”. Ravindanath Singh is saying that we must find more climate data about the variable weather systems in the area. Here, information = data; changes to environmental conditions = variable weather systems; vital = essential. Answer: B. Question 38. EXAMINING PREVIOUS PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOUR MAY HAVE LONG-TERM BENEFITS Keywords: previous, behaviour, long-term benefits Now in the last paragraph, Cameron Petrie’s ideas relate the work of archaeologists to possible benefits today from studying such work. Petrie says that: “By investigating responses to environmental pressures and threats, we can learn from the past to engage with the public, and the relevant governmental and administrative bodies, to be more proactive in issues such as…..” Petrie believes that the work of archaeologists in investigating how past civilisations responded to environmental challenges, can help us to tackle such problems today. These are the potential long-term benefits. Here, examining = investigating; patterns of behaviour = responses. Answer: A. Question 39. ROUGH CALCULATIONS INDICATE THE APPROXIMATE LENGTH OF A PERIOD OF WATER SHORTAGE Keywords: calculations, length, water shortage Now in paragraph E, Yama Dixit comments on the effects of drought on the drying of a great lake. However, it is David Hodell who comments on the possible length/duration of this drought: “Hodell adds: ‘We estimate that the weakening of the Indian summer monsoon climate lasted about 200 years before recovering to the previous conditions…” Here, rough calculations = estimate; approximate = about; a period of water shortage = weakening of the Indian summer monsoon climate. Therefore, it was David Hodell who made this rough calculation. Answer: D. Question 40. INFORMATION ABOUT THE DECLINE OF THE HARAPPAN CIVILISATION HAS BEEN LACKING Keywords: decline Now, in paragraph B, Cameron Petrie says: “There is plenty of archaeological evidence to tell us about the rise of the Harappan Civilisation, but relatively little about its fall’, explains archaeologist Dr Cameron Petrie…” Here, information = evidence; decline = fall. As there is not much evidence about the fall/decline of the Harappan Civilisation, we know that this information is lacking. Answer: A.",

      "content_clean": "Cambridge IELTS 14 Listening Test 4 Answers SECTION 1 1. Answer : 85 Here’s what the speakers say: ANDREW – Will you be having a sit-down meal or a buffet? SAM – Probably a sit-down. ANDREW – And do you know how many people there’ll be? SAM– Around eighty, I think. ANDREW – Well we have two rooms that can hold that number. One is the Adelphi Room. That can seat eighty-five, or hold over a hundred if people are standing for a buffet. Explanation: The customer is asking about holding an event at the hotel, and we can tell that they are talking about the rooms for the events, which is the answer for Question 1, so we should focus here. According to Andrew, they have two rooms suitable for the request, one of them is the Adelphi Room, which can seat 85 (= it has enough seats for 85 people), or more than a hundred if it is a standing buffet. However, the customer requires a sit-down meal, so the answer is 85. 2. Answer: roses Here’s what the speaker says: ANDREW – […] Now the Adelphi Room is at the back of the hotel, and there are French windows leading out onto the terrace. This has a beautiful display of pots of roses at that time of the year. Explanation: After Question 1, Andrew continues to talk a bit about the services of the Adelphi Room. Candidates need to be careful not to lose their concentration. Andrew mentions the room is “at the back of the hotel”, and the guests can see from the French windows “leading out” to the “pots of roses” on the terrace. Roses is the answer for Question 2. 3. Answer: trees Here’s what the speaker says: ANDREW – From the terrace you can see the area of trees within the grounds of the hotel, or you can stroll through there to the river – that’s on the far side, so it isn’t visible from the hotel. Explanation: As Question 3 is also in the part of the “Adelphi Room”, the answer will not be far away from the answer for Question 2. Right after finishing talking about the direction of the room, Andrew continues to describe the view from the terrace. Andrew says that the trees ‘within the grounds’ can be seen ‘from the terrace’. He also mentions the river, but it’s ‘on the far side’, so it’s not ‘visible’ – cannot be seen – from the hotel, or the terrace. So the answer is trees. 4. Answer: Stage Here’s what the speaker says: ANDREW – Then another option is the Carlton Room. This is a bit bigger — it can hold up to a hundred and ten people — and it has the advantage of a stage, which is useful if you have any entertainment, or indeed a small band can fit onto it. Explanation: Moving on the second room, the Carlton Room, is one of the choices for the event, and by the mention of the name, we know that we are getting closer to the answer to Question 4. The blank clearly needs a noun, and from what Andrew says, we learn that the room has a stage. Answer: stage 5. Answer: speech Here’s what the speakers say: ANDREW – As well as a meal, you can have an MC, a Master of Ceremonies, who’ll be with you throughout the party. SAM – What exactly is the MC’s function? I suppose they make a speech during the meal if we need one, do they? ANDREW – That’s right. All our MCs are trained as public speakers, so they can easily get people’s attention – many guests are glad to have someone who can make themselves heard above the chatter! Explanation: We know that the answer will be found in the Master of Ceremonies section. ‘Make a speech’ and ‘give a speech’ have the same meaning. The guest asks if the MC can ‘make a speech’ during the meal, which means while they are eating. Andrew confirms that the MC can make a speech, so the answer for Question 5 is ‘speech’. Answer: speech 6. Answer: support Here’s what the speaker says: ANDREW – And they’re also your support – if anything goes wrong, the MC will deal with it, so you can relax. Explanation: The words ‘anything goes wrong’ relates to having ‘problems’, and the MC will ‘deal with it’, which is identical to ‘provide support’. So the answer is support. Answer: support 7. Answer: cabins Here’s what the speakers say: SAM – Great! I’ll need to ask you about food, but something else that’s important is accommodation. You obviously have rooms in the hotel, but do you also have any other accommodation, like cabins, for example? ANDREW – Yes, there are five in the grounds, all self-contained. They each sleep two to four people and have their own living room, bathroom and small kitchen. Explanation: The man mentions “accommodation” so we can expect the answer for Question 7 will come next, and we find the word “cabin” appears in the conversation. The following answer also continues to describe the facilities of the cabins, so cabins is the right answer. Answer: cabins 8. Answer: C Here’s what the speakers say: SAM – Now you have various facilities, don’t you? Are they all included in the price of hiring the room? The pool, for instance. ANDREW – Normally you’d be able to use it, but it’ll be closed throughout September for refurbishment, I’m afraid. Explanation: The customer asks about other facilities and asks if the access to the pool is included in the price of hiring the room, but there is no information on the extra cost. The pool will be ‘closed’ for ‘refurbishment’ during September, so it is not available right now. Therefore, the answer is C. Answer: C 9. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: ANDREW – The gym will be available, though, at no extra charge. That’s open all day, from six in the morning until midnight. Explanation: The answer for Question 9 comes right after the answer for Question 8. That’s why candidates need to spend time to look at questions beforelistening and get a gist of what kind of information they need for each question, so they know where to focus on. The gym will be at ‘no extra charge’, which means it is included in the cost of hiring the room, so the Answer is A. Answer A. 10. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: ANDREW – And the tennis courts, but there is a small additional payment for those. We have four courts, and it’s worth booking in advance if you possibly can, as there can be quite a long waiting list for them. Explanation: There is a ‘small additional payment’ for the tennis court, so if you want to use them, you have to pay an extra charge. The tennis courts can be booked in advance and there’s often ‘a long waiting list’, so they are not available right now. The answer is B. Answer: B SECTION 2 11. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: One thing you have to do while you’re here is go dolphin watching. On our boat trips, we pretty well guarantee you’ll see dolphins – if you don’t you can repeat the trip free of charge. We organise daily trips for just 35 euros. Unfortunately, there aren’t any places left for this afternoon’s trip, but come and see me to book for later in the week. Explanation: According to the speaker, the guests can ‘repeat the trip free of charge’ but only if they do not see dolphins, so it cannot be considered as no charge. The organisers of the ‘daily trips’ do not have ‘any places left for this afternoon’s trip’ and the guests are advised to ‘book for later in the week’, which means today is already fully-booked. G is the answer. Answer: G 12. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: lf you re energetic, I’d recommend our forest walk. It’s a guided walk of about seven kilometres. There’ll be a stop half way, and you’ll be provided with a drink and sandwiches. Explanation: In this kind of question, speakers will quickly talk about each part, which is each question, so candidates need to know the choices very well to know what options they have. The words ‘provided with a drink and sandwiches’ means food is included. No information is given on the other options, so the answer is D. Answer: D 13. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: Then on Thursdays we organise a cycle trip, which will give you all the fun of biking without the effort. We’ll take you and your bike up to the top of Mount Larna, and leave you to bike back – it’s a 700-metre drop in just 20 kilometres so this isn’t really for inexperienced cyclists as you’ll be going pretty fast. And if it’s a clear day, you’ll have fantastic views. Explanation: The trip ‘isn’t really for inexperienced cyclists’ implies that it is not suitable for beginners. There will be fantastic views on a clear day, but this doesn’t mean we can only go in good weather. It’s a ‘700-metre drop’ in 20km from the top of the mountain, which means going/downhill, so the answer is A. Answer: A. 14. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: On our local craft tour, you can find out about the traditional activities in the island. And the best thing about this trip is that it’s completely free. You’ll be taken to a factory where jewellery is made, and also a ceramics centre. lf you want, you can buy some of the products, but that’s entirely up to you. Explanation: It is clearly stated at the beginning of the sentence that he is talking about the craft tour, so we should focus here to find the answer for Question 14. The trip consists of visits to see traditional activities and you are free to buy products if you wish. Especially, the trip is “completely free”, which means there will be no charge, so the answer is E. Answer: E 15. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: lf you’re interested in astronomy you may already know that the island’s one of the best places in the world to observe the night sky. We can offer trips to the observatory on Friday for those who are interested. They cost 90 euros per person and you’ll be shown the huge telescopes and have a talk from an expert, who’ll explain all about how they work. Afterwards, we’ll head down to Sunset Beach, where you can have a dip in the ocean if you want before we head off back to the hotel. Explanation: After Question 14, the speaker continues to talk a lot about the following trips, but has not mentioned any related information. Candidates need to be careful not to lose their concentration. Finally he mentions that at the end of the trip, the guests will go to Sunset Beach to have a ‘dip in the ocean’, which means it will be possible to swim in the ocean before heading back. The answer is F. Answer: F 16. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: Finally, there’s horse riding. This is organised by the Equestrian Centre over near Playa Cortino and it’s a great experience if you’re a keen horseback rider, or even if you’ve never been on a horse before. Explanation: The trip is a ‘great experience’ not only for a keen horseback rider, but also for people who ‘have never been on a horse before’, so it’s suitable even for beginners. B is the answer. Answer: B 17-18. Answer: B. You must book it in advance. D. You can meet the performers. Here’s what the speaker says: Well, the number one attraction’s called ‘Musical Favourites’. Guests enjoy a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks, and watch a fantastic show, starting with musicals set in Paris and then crossing the Atlantic to Las Vegas and finally Copacabana. At the end the cast members come down from the stage, still in their stunning costumes, and you’ll have a chance to chat with them. It’s hugely popular, so let me know now if you’re interested because it’s no good leaving it until the last minute. It’s on Friday night. Tickets are just 90 euros each, but for an extra 10 euros you can have a table right by the stage. Explanation: With this kind of question, make sure that you understand all the choices you have before listening as the speaker will paraphrase it and say it in a different way, and the number of choices may confuse you if you do not know them well. The speaker is talking about an attraction called ‘Musical Favourites’, where you can enjoy meals and drink while enjoying a fantastic show. The guests can “have a chance to chat” and meet the performers at the end of the show (answer D). As it is very popular, it’s “no good leaving it until the last minute”, which means you have to book early (answer B). There’s no information on whether you have to pay extra for the drink (answer A), getting discount on purchasing two tickets (answer C) or joining in the show (answer E). So the answers are B and D Answers: B, D (in either order) 19-20. Answer: A Visitors can dance after the meal., D Knives and forks are not used. Here’s what the speaker says: lf you’d like to go back in time, there’s the Castle Feast on Saturday evening. It’s held in a twelfth-century castle, and you eat in the great courtyard, with ladies in long gowns serving your food. You re given a whole chicken each, which you eat in the medieval way, using your hands instead of cutlery, and you re entertained by competitions where the horseback riders attempt to knock one another off their horses. Then you can watch the dancers in the ballroom and join in as well if you want. Explanation: The speaker may say some words used in the answers, but in a different context to make candidates confused. So, be careful, especially because in IELTS Listening it is common that the examiners will paraphrase the words you hear in the script. The speaker describes Castle Feast, an event held in an ancient castle. You are given a “whole chicken”, which means you cannot choose the type of food (answer B). You have to eat by hand without knives and forks (answer D) while being entertained by horseback riders knocking each other off their horses. So, this is NOT horse racing (answer E). There’s no rule about dress code for the guests (answer C), but they can join in the dancing in the ballroom (answer A). So, the answers are A and D, Answers: A, D (in either order). SECTION 3 21. Answer: A. the fact that authors may not realise what values they’re teaching Here’s what the speaker says: TREVOR – And whether the teaching should be factual – giving them information about the world – or ethical, teaching them values. What’s fascinating is that the writer isn’t necessarily conscious of the message they’re conveying. For instance, a story might show a child who has a problem as a result of not doing what an adult has told them to do, implying that children should always obey adults. Explanation: Trevor mentions that literature can be factual or ethical, so we can exclude answer B. There’s no information on the fact that children are expected to act like fictional characters, so C is not the answer He finds that the writers are not “necessarily conscious” of what they are delivering, which means they may not recognise their own values. So the answer is A Answer: A 22. Answer: C. decide to start writing some children’s stories. Here’s what the speaker says: TREVOR – That module made me realise how important stories are – they can have a significant effect on children as they grow up. Actually, it inspired me to have a go at it myself, just for my own interest. l know l can’t compete with the really popular stories, like the Harry Potter books – they’re very good, and even young kids like my seven-year-old niece love reading them. Explanation: Thanks to the module, Trevor realised the important effect of children’s stories on children, which motivates him to “have a go” at creating his own children’s stories (answer C). He wants to write them for his own satisfaction, not to compete with popular stories that young kids read, because those popular stories are very good – so answer B is incorrect. The module only made him aware of the importance of stories, but did not motivate him to analyse children’s stories, so A is also incorrect. The answer is C. Answer: C 23. Answer: A. she intends to become an illustrator. Here’s what the speaker says: STEPHANIE – I remember some frightening ones I saw as a child and I can still see them vividly in my mind, years later! Pictures can be so powerful, just as powerful as words. I’ve always enjoyed drawing, so that’s the field I want to go into when I finish the course. Explanation: The impact of visual images has influenced Stephanie since she was young, when she happened to see some frightening (not beautiful) images (thus we can exclude answer B). Pictures and words have the same power – therefore illustration are not more important than words (answer C is incorrect). She wants to work in the illustration field as she really enjoys drawing. So the answer is A. Answer: A 24. Answer: B. have the potential for being useful. Here’s what the speakers say: TREVOR – We also studied comics in that module, but I’m not convinced of their value, not compared with books. One of the great things about words is that you use your imagination, but with a comic you don’t have to. STEPHANIE – But children are so used to visual input – on TV, video games, and so on. There are plenty of kids who wouldn’t even try to read a book, so I think comics can serve a really useful purpose. TREVOR – You mean, it’s better to read a comic than not to read at all? Yes, I suppose you’re right. Explanation: Trevor is not convinced of the value of comics as – unlike when reading books –children don’t have to use ‘imagination’ when reading comics. However, Stephanie disagrees and suggests that comics can provide ‘visual input’ for children, and this might encourage children to try to read a book. Trevor supposes she is right. We also need to make sure that they agree and move on to the next part, in case the other candidate does not agree and they change their idea. In this question, Trevor agrees that comics can be useful. Answer: B 25. Answer: B. how few books were aimed at both girls and boys Here’s what the speaker says: TREVOR – For years, lots of stories, in English, at least, assumed that boys went out and did adventurous things and girls stayed at home and played with dolls. I was amazed how many books were targeted at just one sex or the other. Of course this reflects society as it is when the books are written. Explanation: Trevor stated that there were lots of books in England intended for only one gender. This implies that the books that targeted both genders, boys and girls, were very rare and he was amazed by how few they were. So the answer is B. Answer: B 26. Answer: F Here’s what the speakers say: TREVORM – So does that mean you’ve read Perrault’s fairy tales? Cinderella,The Sleeping Beauty, and so on. STEPHANIE – Yes. They must be important, because no stories of that type had been written before, these were the first. Explanation: Stephanie claims that reading a lot of children’s stories motivated her to take the course. Trevor then mentions the works of Perrault such as Cinderella or The Sleeping Beauty and so on. Stephanie says that those fairy tales are important, and refers to them as ‘the first’ because ‘no stories of that type had been written before’, implying that these fairy stories had started a new genre/type at that time. Therefore, the answer is F. Answer: F 27. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: STEPHANIE – The English name makes it sound as though Robinson is the family’s surname, but a more accurate translation would be The Swiss Robinsons, because it’s about a Swiss family who are shipwrecked, like Robinson Crusoe in the novel of a century earlier. Explanation: The name of the book should have a “more accurate translation” : The SwissRobinsons which is about a Swiss family who are “shipwrecked” . The speaker then compares the book to another novel “of a century earlier” , Robinson Crusoe, which leads to the answer E. Answer: E 28. Answer: C Here’s what the speakers say: STEPHANIE – Have you read Hoffmann’s The Nutcracker and the Mouse King? TREVOR – Wasn’t that the basis for Tchaikovsky’s ballet The Nutcracker? Explanation: The answer for Question 28 comes right after the answer for Question 27. That’s why candidates need to spend time to take a quick look at all the questions before listening, and draft out what kind of information they need for each question, so they know where to focus on. As Stephanie mentions, The Nutcracker and the Mouse King was originally a children’s book by Hoffman, but was later used as “the basis for Tchaikovsky’s ballet”, in a different area of art. So C is the answer. Answer: C 29. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: STEPHANIE – I struggled with Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings — three long books, and l gave up after one. Explanation: Stephanie mentions that she ‘struggled’ with Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, which means it was difficult reading it. After that, she ‘gave up’ on the books after the first one, which implies that this series is very hard to read. So the answer is B, Answer: B 30. Answer: G Here’s what the speakers say: STEPHANIE – Another one I’ve read is War Horse. TREVOR – It’s about the First World War, isn’t it? Hardly what you’d expect for a children’s story. Explanation: With previous questions and answers given, we know that the speakers continue to talk about children’s stories and they mention one about the First World War. This is a story about war, so we ‘hardly expect’ to find a story about war in a book for children. It is an unlikely topic for a children’s book, so the answer is G. Answer: G SECTION 4 31. Answer: spring Here’s what the speaker says: The village contained an impressive monument: seven half-tonne stones standing in a semicircle around a spring, that might have been used for ceremonial purposes. Explanation: Question 31 is in the introduction part, so the answer is probably in the first part of the speech. We pay attention here. The word ‘half-tonne’ implies a very large stone, and it stands “in a semicircle around a spring”, so the answer for the question is ‘spring’. Answer: spring 32. Answer: tools Here’s what the speaker says: Research on the buildings, tools and the human remains has revealed how the bustling village once functioned, and even what diseases some of its residents suffered from. Explanation: In the task of completing notes, candidates should pay attention to the title of each part, as it will tell you where the answer belongs, where to focus on. According to the speaker, there has been research on buildings, or types of structures, tools and the human remains to reveal the life of people in the past. The answer for this question is tools. Answer: tools 33. Answer: maps Here’s what the speaker says: p. Autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, are used in the oil industry, for instance, to create maps of the seabed before rigs and pipelines are installed. Explanation: Candidates should be aware of what information they need for each answer. The answer we are looking for focuses on things that the oil industry makes, not what it uses to make things. In the talk, the speaker stated that the oil industry used both Autonomous underwater vehicles or AUVs and later on used rigs and pipelines to create “maps of the seabed”, so the answer is maps. Answer: maps 34. Answer: heavy Here’s what the speaker says: To navigate they use sensors, such as compasses and sonar. Until relatively recently they were very expensive, and so heavy that they had to be launched from a large vessel with a winch. Explanation: The answer for Question 34 comes right after the answer for Question 33. That’s why candidates need to spend time to look at questions before listening and get a gist of what kind of information they need for each question, so they know where to focus on. The phrase “launched from a large vessel with a winch” is to emphasise the weight which causes the problems. It is clear that the missing word is an adjective. So heavy is the right answer. Answer: heavy 35. Answer: marble Here’s what the speaker says: For example, in a trial in 2015, three AUVs searched for wrecks at Marzamemi, off the coast of Sicily. The site is the final resting place of an ancient Roman ship, which sank in the sixth century AD while ferrying prefabricated marble elements for the construction of an early church. Explanation: After the question about the problems of the AUVs, the speaker talks about a lot of other issues. Candidates need to be careful not to lose their concentration. The speaker then mentions that at the site where the Roman ship sank, “prefabricated marble elements” were found, which once were carried by the ships. The speaker says that these were to be used to build a church, so this is related to architecture. As there can only be one word, the answer is marble. Answer: marble 36. Answer: light Here’s what the speaker says: For short distances, AUVs can share data using light, while acoustic waves are used to communicate over long distances. Explanation: The speaker mentions “for short distances”, which indicates that this is where we should focus on to find the answer for Question 36. And right after that, AUVs are stated to be able to communicate at short distance using light. The speaker also continues to talk about the use of acoustic waves in long distance communication, this means there’s no other answer and “light” is the right answer. Answer: light 37. Answer: cameras Here’s what the speaker says: So if an AUV surveying the seabed finds an intriguing object, it can share the coordinates of the object – that is, its position – with a nearby AUV that carries superior cameras, and arrange for that AUV to make a closer inspection of the object. Explanation: It’s mentioned that when doing the survey, an AUV can share the position of an intriguing object with an AUV nearby which has superior – or better – cameras and which is therefore more suitable to inspect the object more closely. The answer is cameras. Answer: cameras 38. Answer: medical Here’s what the speaker says: In 1974, a 2000-year-old Roman vessel was discovered here, in 18 metres of water. When it sank, it was carrying medical goods, in wooden or tin receptacles. Explanation: The AUVs have huge potential that makes marine archaeologists very excited, as they are planning to explore the area where a 2000-year-old Roman ship/ vessel is located. It is said that the vessel carried with it various types of medical goods when it went down into the sea. The answer is medical. Answer: medical 39. Answer: eyes Here’s what the speaker says: Its cargo gives us insight into the treatments available all those years ago, including tablets that are thought to have been dissolved to form a cleansing liquid for the eyes. Explanation: The answer of question 39 comes right after the previous answer. The speaker mentions the treatment methods from years ago, when tablets were believed to have been made into a liquid for eye cleansing. The answer for this question is eyes. Answer: eyes 40. Answer: wine Here’s what the speaker says: Other Roman ships went down nearby, taking their cargo with them. Some held huge pots made of terracotta. Some were used for transporting cargoes of olive oil, and others held wine. Explanation: There were several ships carrying different things that went down in the sea. We need to focus on the sentence in which the speaker describes the ships carrying oil, and it is clear that some of the ships held wine. So the answer is wine. Answer: wine Banglay IELTS​",

      "content_clean": "SECTION 1 1. Answer: Tesla Here’s what the speakers say: MAN – OK. Now can you tell me a bit about what conference facilities you have? ANGELA – Sure. So for talks and presentations we have the Tesla room. MAN – Sorry? ANGELA – Tesla – that’s spelled T-E-S-L-A. It holds up to a hundred people, and it’s fully equipped with a projector and so on. Explanation: When the customers start asking about the conference facilities, we can tell that they are talking about the type of room for the talk, which is the answer for Question 1, so we should focus here. This is not a difficult question. With this kind of question, speakers will always spell the word unless it’s too common. Therefore, candidates should not panic and wait until they spell it, and just note down what you can hear. You should be careful and concentrate until you are sure that they move on to the next part of the conversation. The correct answer is Tesla. Answer: Tesla 2. Answer: microphone Here’s what the speakers say: ANGELA – It holds up to a hundred of people, and it’s fully equipped with a projector and so on. MAN – How about a microphone? ANGELA – Yes, that’ll be all set up ready for you, and there’ll be one that members of the audience can use too, for questions, if necessary. Explanation: The answer for Question 2 comes right after the answer for Question 1. That’s why candidates need to spend time to look at questions before listening and get a gist of what kind of information they need for each question, so they know where to focus on. The room is already “fully equipped” with a “projector”, this information we already have, so we need to focus on the following information. The customer asks about the microphone and it will be “set up ready”, which means that the microphone will be “available”. Microphone is the answer. Answer: Microphone 3. Answer: exhibition Here’s what the speakers say: MAN – And we’ll also need some sort of open area where people can sit and have a cup of coffee, and we’d like to have an exhibition of our products and services there as well, so that’ll need to be quite a big space. ANGELA – That’s fine, there’s a central atrium with all those facilities, and you can come before the conference starts if you want to set everything up. Explanation: After the request for the necessary facilities, the customer moves on to the next question. Aside from “open area” for “a cup of coffee”, the man would also like to have “an exhibition” in a big space’. Paying attention to the articles “an” could also help to find the right word easier, as the word will need to start with a vowel. Answer: exhibition 4. Answer: Wifi Here’s what the speakers say: MAN – Great. And I presume there’s wifi? ANGELA – Oh yes, that’s free and available throughout the hotel. Explanation: As Question 4 is also in the part of “conference facilities”, the answer will not be far away from the answer for Question 3. Right after asking about the area for coffee and exhibition, the customer went on to ask about the wifi. Angela then confirms that it’s “free” “throughout the hotel”, so the answer is Wifi. Answer: Wifi 5. Answer: 45 Here’s what the speakers say: ANGELA – Would you also like us to provide a buffet lunch? We can do a two-course meal with a number of different options. MAN – What sort of price are we looking at for that? ANGELA – Well, I can send you a copy of the standard menu. That’s $45 per person. Or you can have the special for $25 more. Explanation: Candidates should get used to some currency names, symbols and codes, for example, the official currency of the US is dollar (symbol: $, ISO code: USD) so they do not get confused in some situations like this. At first, Angela suggests providing a buffet lunch with a number of options. When you see the symbol $, you would know you have to listen to the information about cash. The correct price for a standard buffet lunch is $45 per person, or per head. There is extra information on the additional of $25 for the special lunch, this is information added to cause distraction and confusion. Therefore, it is not just the amount of cash should candidates pay attention to, but also the other content of the script. Answer: 45 6. Answer: 135 Here’s what the speakers say: MAN – Now we’re also going to need accommodation on the Saturday night for some of the participants…I’m not sure how many, but probably about 25. So what do you charge for a room? ANGELA – Well, for conference attendees we have a 25% reduction, so we can offer you rooms at $135. Normally a standard room’s $180. MAN – And does that include breakfast? ANGELA – Sure. Explanation: As there is also the symbol $ in the question, you will have to listen to the information about cash on this one as well. According to the conversation, the original room rate is $180, but Angela offers 25% discount from the rate and the guest only have to pay $135 per room, so the answer is $135. And that has included breakfast as Angela has confirmed. Candidates should note down information that they can hear in the first place, after that, when the speaker explains further, candidates can compare the information they had with the new information to see which one is needed. There will often be information that is given just to confuse candidates. Answer: 135 7. Answer: pool Here’s what the speaker says: ANGELA – So we’ve got a spa where you can get massages and facials and so on, and there’s a pool up on the roof for the use of guests. Explanation: After Angela and the customer finish talking about the room rates, Angela starts talking about the hotel’s facilities, and this is where the answer for Question 7 is. With the answer given, we already know that the hotel has a spa and then she mentions a pool “up on the roof”, so the answer is pool. Answer: pool 8. Answer: airport Here’s what the speakers say: MAN – Now what about transport links? The hotel’s downtown, isn’t it? ANGELA – Yes, it’s about 12 kilometres from the airport, but there’s a complimentary shuttle bus for guests. And it’s only about ten minutes’ walk from the central railway station. Explanation: The question of the customer tells us that he is asking about the options of transportation to the hotel. While talking about the distance between the airport and the hotel, Angela mentions the “complimentary” shuttle bus service, so this is the bus to the airport and it is a “free” service. The talk about the railway station is just extra information. This is a trick that candidates need to be aware of: there may be more than one piece of information that can potentially be the answer. Answer: airport 9. Answer: sea Here’s what the speakers say: MAN – OK. Now, I don’t know Sydney very well, can you just give me an idea of the location of the hotel? ANGELA – Well, it’s downtown on Wilby Street, that’s quite a small street, and it’s not very far from the sea. Explanation: To give information on the location of the hotel, Angela mentions that the hotel is located on a small street called Wilby Street. This is a sign to tell us to focus here to seek the answer for question 9. The hotel is ‘not very far’ from the sea implies that it is ‘quite near’, so the answer is ‘sea’. Answer: sea 10. Answer: clubs Here’s what the speaker says: ANGELA – And of course if the conference attendees want to go out on the Saturday evening there’s a huge choice of places to eat. Then if they want to make a night of it, they can go on to one of the clubs in the area – there are a great many to choose from. Explanation: The words ‘in the area’ means that they are around where the hotel is located. And there a ‘great many’ of clubs from which to choose, so the answer is ‘clubs’ Answer: clubs SECTION 2 11-12. Answer: A decorating, E childcare Here’s what the speaker says: Volunteers can do all sorts of things, depending on their own abilities and interests. lf they’re supporting a family that’s struggling, for example, they may be able to give them tips on cooking, or recommend how to plan their budget or how to shop sensibly on their income. They might even do some painting or wallpapering, perhaps alongside any members of the family who are able to do it. Or even do some babysitting so that parents can go out for a while. Explanation: With this kind of question, make sure that you understand all the choices you have before listening, as the speaker will paraphrase it and say it in a different way. The number of choices may confuse you if you do not know them well. The first thing is giving tips on cooking, which is not one of the answers. The examples which follow include “recommend how to plan their budget” or “shop sensibly”, which are just pieces of advice on their shopping habits, and they do not actually help them with the work. Then, more activities are mentioned, like ‘doing some painting or wallpapering’, which means decorating the house, and ‘babysitting’, which means childcare. Answer: A, E (in either order) 13-14. Answer: D improved ability at time management E boosting their employment prospects Here’s what the speaker says: The benefit from volunteering isn’t only for the people being helped. Volunteers also gain from it: they’re using their skills to cope with somebody’s mental or physical ill health, and volunteering may be a valuable element of their CV when they’re applying for jobs: employers usually look favourably on someone who’s given up time to help others. Significantly, most volunteers feel that what they’re doing gives them a purpose in their lives. And in my opinion, they’re lucky in that respect, as many people don’t have that feeling. Explanation: In the first part, the speaker talks about how volunteering will help other people, so we can expect he will explain further about how the volunteers themselves can benefit from it, which is the answer for Question 13 and 14. He may use some words used in the answers, but in a different context, so be careful, especially because in IELTS Listening, it is common that they will paraphrase the words you hear in the script. So, you may not hear exactly the same words. One of the benefits is that volunteers have the chance to use their skills to “cope with somebody’s mental or physical ill health”, add “a valuable element” to their CV because employers are more likely to offer a job to people who have done voluntary work (answer E). Volunteering also “gives them a purpose in their lives” (answer B). There is no information about working in a team (answer A), realisation that they are lucky to be doing voluntary work (answer C) or management skills (answer D). Anwesr: B, E (in either order). 15. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: Habib supports an elderly lady who is beginning to show signs of dementia. Once a week they, along with other elderly people, go to the local community centre, where a group of people come in and sing. The songs take the listeners back to their youth, and for a little while they can forget the difficulties that they face now. Explanation: The words “take the listeners back to their youth” implies bringing back old memories, or remembering times in the past, so F is the right answer. Answer: F 16. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: Our volunteer Consuela is an amazing woman. She has difficulty walking herself, but she doesn’t let that stop her. She helps a couple of people with similar difficulties, who had almost stopped walking altogether. By using herself as an example, Consuela encourages them to walk more and more. Explanation: Having ‘difficulty walking herself’ also means having ‘physical difficulties’. Consuela not only ‘doesn’t let that stop her’ but also ‘helps’ and ‘encourages’ people with the same situation to ‘walk more and more’, and thus she has overcome her problems by using herself as an example. Answer: A 17. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: Minh visits a young man who lives alone and can’t leave home on his own, so he hardly ever saw anyone. But together they go out to the cinema, or to see friends the young man hadn’t been able to visit for a long time. Explanation: The word ‘isolation’ is the state of being alone or apart from others. The man is living alone and ‘hardly ever saw anyone’ due to personal reasons, which means that he did not meet people often. Candidates need to pay attention to a connector of contrast like “but”, as it indicates something opposite to what he just said. It’s true since nowadays, he and Minh ‘go out to the cinema” together or “see friends”, and that means he is not isolated anymore, so the answer is E. Answer: E 18. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: Tanya visits an elderly woman once a week. When the woman found out that Tanya is a professional dressmaker, she got interested. Tanya showed her some soft toys she’d made, and the woman decided to try it herself. And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours making toys. They’re not perhaps up to Tanya’s standard yet, but she gains a lot of pleasure from doing it. Explanation: The speaker talks about Tanya, who is a professional dressmaker, who often visits an old woman every week. The elderly woman got “interested” in the soft toys and “decided to try it herself”. She “enjoys it” and “gains a lot of pleasure” from doing it. All of the words are describing how enjoyable it is for the elderly lady to do what she likes, which implies that she has found a new hobby. Answer: G 19. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: Alexei is a volunteer with a family that faces a number of difficulties. By calmly talking over possible solutions with family members, he’s helping them to realise that they aren’t helpless, and that they can do something themselves to improve their situation. This has been great for their self-esteem. Explanation: The speaker mentions that Alexei is with a family with lots of difficulties, so he might be helping them solve their problems. And it’s true that he helps people believe that they aren’t “helpless” and that they can learn to “improve their situation” by “themselves”, and this means solving their problems independently. Answer: D 20. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: And the last volunteer I’ll mention, though there are plenty more, is Juba. She volunteers with a teenage girl with learning difficulties, who wasn’t very good at talking to other people. Juba’s worked very patiently with her, and now the girl is far better at expressing herself, and at understanding other people. Explanation: The speaker mentions that Juba offers assistance to a girl who has trouble in learning and “wasn’t very good at talking” to people, so we are expecting a change in her communication. Being supported patiently by Juba, the teenage girl has now become ‘far better at expressing herself’ and ‘understanding others’. This implies that her communication skills have improved a lot. So the answer is C. Answer: C SECTION 3 21. Answer: 50 Here’s what the speaker says: JOE – Well the band has students in it from all years, so they’re aged 11 to 18, and there are about 50 of them altogether. Explanation: The note requires the number that the band “consists of”, so you would know you have to listen to the information about the total number of the members of the band. The number of the student’s ages, which are 11 and 18, might be added just to confuse the candidates. The speaker mentions ‘altogether’, which means all the students in the band and that means 50 members. The adverbs ‘around’ and ‘about’ have a similar meaning, so the answer is 50. Answer: 50/fifty 22. Answer: regional Here’s what the speaker says: JOE – They aren’t really good enough to enter national band competitions, but they’re in a regional one later in the term. Explanation: Joe mentions the national band competitions, though they are also not good enough to play in one. However, candidates need to pay attention to a connector of contrast like “but”, as it implies something opposite to what he just said. He said they are going to be in a regional competition. The band is expected to play ‘later in the term’, so it already has a due date. The answer is “regional”. Answer: regional 23. Answer: carnival Here’s what the speaker says: JOE – Well, now the town council’s organising a carnival in the summer, and the band has been asked to perform. Explanation: The speaker says they are ‘asked to perform’, which also means to be ‘invited to play’. Also, they are invited by the town council, which is the organiser of a carnival, so it is clear that they are going to perform in a carnival. The answer is ‘carnival’. Answer: carnival 24. Answer: drummer Here’s what the speaker says: JOE – I played a recording I came across, of a drummer talking about how playing in a band had changed his life. Explanation: Joe mentions that he happened to “play a recording” about “a drummer talking” about his life, implying that they have all listened to his talk, so the answer is drummer. Answer: drummer 25. Answer: Film Here’s what the speakers says: JOE – I’m planning to show them that old film from the 1940s “Strike Up the Band”, and talk about it with the students. LIZZIE – Good idea. As it’s about a school band, it might make the students realise how much they can achieve if they work together. Explanation: ‘The students’ here refers to the ‘members of the band’. Joe wants to show them an old film from the 1940s called ‘Strike Up the Band’ and talk about the film with them. This means that he plans to discuss it with them. The answer is film. Answer: film 26. Answer: parade Here’s what the speaker says: – I’m hoping I can take some of the band to a parade that’s going to take place next month. A couple of marching bands will be performing, and the atmosphere should be quite exciting. It depends on whether I can persuade the school to hire a coach or two to take us there. Explanation: Joe mentions that he is working to persuade the school to allow him to ‘take some of the band’ to perform at the parade ‘next month’ along with other marching bands. This means they are planning to “attend” the parade, which is the answer. Answer: parade 27. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: JOE – There’s a flautist who says she loves playing in the band. We rehearse twice a week after school. But she’s hardly ever there. Explanation: The term: ‘hardly ever there’ implies that the flautist is often absent during rehearsals, and that means she keeps missing the rehearsal of the band. She keeps giving reasons such as she has been ill, but they might be just excuses, so we don’t know if she has health problems. There’s no indication of other problems, so D is the answer. Answer: D 28. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: JOE – There’s a trumpeter who thinks she’s the best musician in the band, though she certainly isn’t. She’s always saying what she thinks other people should do, which makes my job pretty difficult. Explanation: The trumpeter ‘think she’s the best’, but Joe thinks she isn’t, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that she makes a lot of mistakes. However, what she always says makes Joe's job difficult because her suggestions all the time about what other people should do. These do not help Joe – in fact, they make his life more difficult. The answer is B. Answer: B 29. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: JOE – One of the trombonists has got an impressive sense of rhythm, and could be an excellent musician — except that he has breathing difficulties, and he doesn’t really have enough breath for the trombone. Explanation: The trombonist has ‘got an impressive sense of rhythm’, which means he is excellent with rhythm and doesn’t have difficulties with it. To have ‘breathing difficulties’ and “does not have enough breath’ refers to have ‘a health problem’, so the answer is E. Answer: E 30. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: JOE – One of the percussionists isn’t too bad, but he never seems to interact with other people. and he always rushes off as soon as the rehearsal ends. Explanation: The percussionist ‘isn’t too bad’, so he does not make a lot of mistakes, but he ‘never seems to interact with other people’ and ‘rushes off’ right after the rehearsal ends. This means that he does not socialise with the band members – or other students – a lot, so the answer is F. Answer: F SECTION 4 31. Answer: violin Here’s what the speaker says: As a child, Lim originally learned to play the piano – like so many children – and also the violin, but when she was 11 her teachers encouraged her to start composing. Explanation: Question 31 is in the introduction part, so the answer is probably in the first part of the speech. We pay attention here. “Studied” means “learned to play” and two of the musical instruments that the speaker mentioned are the “piano” and “violin”. In addition, Lim started composing when she was 11, but she had already played the piano and violin before that, since when she was a child. Therefore, playing these instruments was something that she did before she turned to composition, and the answer is ‘violin’ Answer: violin 32. Answer: energy Here’s what the speaker says: Liza Lim’s compositions are vibrant and full of energy, and she often explores Asian and Australian Aboriginal cultural sources. Explanation: When the speaker says “compositions”, he is talking about the way in which are all similar, and he claims that her works are “vibrant and full of energy”. They come from “various cultural sources”, which are the “Asian and Australian Aboriginal” culture. ‘A great deal’ is a large amount, and has the same ideas as ‘full of’, so the answer is ‘energy’. Answer: energy 33. Answer: complex Here’s what the speaker says: Her music is very expressive, so although it is complex, it has the power of connecting with audiences and performers alike. Explanation: As mentioned in Question 32, the various sources of music might be the reason why Lim’s music is complex. However, the speaker emphasises that even though it’s complex, it’s still expressive and has great connecting power. As we’ve already got the adjective ‘expressive’ in the given information, the answer must be complex. Answer: complex 34. Answer: opera Here’s what the speaker says: In the festival we’re going to give a semi-staged performance of the Oresteia. This is an opera in seven parts, based on the trilogy of ancient Greek tragedies by Aeschylus. Explanation: The second sentence adds more detail to the statement in the first sentence. ‘This’ in the second sentence refers to the Oresteia, which the speaker explains is an opera. Answer: opera 35. Answer: disturbing Here’s what the speaker says: Lim wrote that because the stories in the tragedies are not easy to tell, the sounds she creates are also disturbing, and they include breathing, sobbing, laughing and whistling. Explanation: We need an adjective here, and ‘disturbing’ is the word the speaker uses to describe Lim’s music. Answer: disturbing 36. Answer: clarinet Here’s what the speaker says: After the interval we’ll go to Australia for a piece by Ross Edwards: The Tower of Remoteness. […] The Tower of Remoteness is scored for piano and clarinet. Explanation: The Tower of Remoteness is ‘scored’ for piano and clarinet, which means they need these two instruments to ‘perform’ the piece. Answer: clarinet 37. Answer: diversity Here’s what the speaker says: Edwards’s music has been described as being ‘deeply connected to Australia’, and it can be regarded as a celebration of the diversity of cultures that Australia can be proud of. Explanation: The speaker described Edward’s music as “deeply connected to Australia”, which means it contains many different (=diverse) elements of Australian culture. Thus, it is a celebration of the country’s cultural diversity. Answer: diversity 38. Answer: physics Here’s what the speaker says: He took up the cornet at the age of five, switching to the piano five years later. However, he went to university to study physics, before changing to composition. Explanation: The speaker mentions that the composer Carl Vine had played instruments since he was young, but took up physics in university. It was after that that he changed to learn how to compose. So the answer is physics. Answer: physics 39. Answer: dance Here’s what the speaker says: Before long he had become prominent in Australia as a composer for dance, and in fact has written 25 scores of that type. Explanation: The speaker mentions that he had composed 25 pieces for music for dance, which made him become prominent in Australia. “Prominent” can also be understood as “famous” or “well known”, so the answer is dance. Answer: dance 40. Answer: olympics Here’s what the speaker says: In our third concert, Vine will be represented by his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the Olympics held in 1996. Explanation: The speaker says that in the “third concert”, which refers to the concerts in the “festival”, Vine’s music for the ceremony of the 1996 Olympics will be played in the festival. The answer for this is Olympics. Answer: Olympics Banglay IELTS Learn with fun Share this Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Telegram Email",

JULIE: It’s 219 442 9785 Explanation: The question from the doctor is pretty obvious and Julie makes it simple by providing the correct number the first time, so we should just focus on the ‘numbers’ to get it right. Answer: 219 442 978 2. Answer: 10(th) October Date of birth .. , 1992 Here’s what the speakers say: CARL: OK, and then can I just check that we have the correct date of birth? JULIE: October tenth, 1992 CARL: Oh, I actually have 1991. I’ll just correct that now. Explanation: The doctor wants to confirm Julie’s date of birth, and as we’ve already got the year provided, we need to only focus on the month and day she was born. The doctor mentions the year was wrong, but it is insignificant information, candidates need to be careful not to distracted by this piece of information. Answer: 10(th) October/October 10th 3. Answer: manager Occupation: works as a … Here’s what the speakers say: CARL: Do you have an occupation, either full-time or part-time? JULIE: Yes, I work full-time in Esterhazy’s – you know, the restaurant chain. I started off as a waitress there a few years ago and I’m a manager now. Explanation: The question mentions “occupation” so we know we should pay attention to her next answer to find out the answer for Question 3. Julie worked as a waitress in the past, but now she has become a manager. We need to fill in the form with her current position as the form requires what she “works as”, so the answer is manager. Answer: Manager 4. Answer: Cawley Insurance company: … Life Insurance Here’s what the speakers say: CARL: Right, so one more thing I need to know before we talk about why you’re here, Julie, and that’s the name of your insurance company. JULIE: It’s Cawley Life Insurance, that’s C-A-W-L-E-Y. Explanation: The doctor asks about the name of the insurance company and it is repeated two times, with a clear pronunciation in the latter. With this kind of question about people’s name or address, speakers will always spell the word unless it’s too common. Therefore, candidates should not be panicked and wait until they spell it, and just note down what you can hear. Answer: Cawley 5. Answer: knee Type of problem: pain in a left … Here’s what the speakers say: CARL: So tell me a little about what brought you here today. JULIE: Well, I’ve been getting a pain in my knee, the left one. Explanation: The doctor wants Julie to explain the reason she came to the clinic, as there must be something wrong with her health, referring to the type of problem. Julie makes it clear by saying she has a ‘pain in my knee’, then emphasises that it’s ‘the left one’. “One” is used to replace “knee”, this way of replacing a noun is common in English so the speaker does not have to repeat what he/ she has just said. Answer: knee 6. Answer: 3 weeks When it began: … ago Here’s what the speakers say: CARL: So how long have you been aware of this pain? Is it just a few days, or is it longer than that? JULIE: Longer. It’s been worse for the last couple of days, but it’s three weeks since I first noticed it. Explanation: ‘How long’ is a question for ‘when’ she got the pain. It’s been not just ‘a few days’, but ‘longer’ than that, ‘three weeks’ to be exact. Julie mentions the word ‘last couple of days’, but that is when it’s getting worse, not when it started, this is another piece of distracting information. Answer: 3 weeks 7. Answer: tennis Sports played: belongs to a … club Here’s what the speakers say: CARL: Good. Now you look as if you’re quite fit normally? JULIE: I am, yes. CARL: So do you do any sport on a regular basis? JULIE: Yes, I play a lot of tennis. I belong to a club so I go there a lot. Explanation: Pretty clear, she ‘plays a lot of tennis’ and ‘belongs to a club’. Answer: tennis 8. Answer: running Sports played: goes … regularly Here’s what the speakers say: CARL: And do you do any other types of exercise? JULIE: Yeah, I sometimes do a little swimming, but usually just when I’m on vacation. But I normally go running a few times a week, maybe three or four times. Explanation: Julie goes swimming, but only just when she is ‘on vacation’, so it’s not a regular activity. She however goes running three or four times a week, so the answer is ‘running’. Candidates need to remember to always focus and listen until they move on to the next information, as we don’t know where the distraction can be (before or after the information we are looking for) Answer: running 9. Answer: shoulder Medical history: injured her … last year Here’s what the speakers say: CARL: Hm. So your legs are getting quite a pounding. But you haven’t had any problems up to now? JULIE: No, not with my legs. I did have an accident last year when I slipped and hurt my shoulder, but that’s better now. Explanation: Julie said ‘not my legs’, so we can exclude this option. The answer become clear when Julie said she had an accident and got hurt – which means injured – her shoulder last year. There are some questions about the past, some about the present so candidates should notice the time in the question, and while listening they should take some time expressions like “now” or “last year” into account, and also be aware of the past simple tense used in the conversation. Answer: shoulder 10. Answer: vitamins Medical history: no regular medication apart from … Here’s what the speakers say: CARL: And do you take any medication on a regular basis? JULIE: Well, I take vitamins but that’s all. I’m generally very healthy. Explanation: Julie admit that she takes vitamins, but emphasises that ‘that’s all’, which means vitamins aside, she doesn’t take any other medication. “Apart from” means “except for”, so we have to find an exception. Answer: vitamins SECTION 2 11. Answer: B a new building was constructed for her. Before Queen Elizabeth I visited the castle in 1576, Here’s what the speaker says: However, when Queen Elizabeth I announced that she was going to visit the castle in 1576, it was beginning to look a bit run down, and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms, they’d make a new house for her out of wood next to the main hall. She stayed there for four nights and apparently it was very luxurious, but unfortunately it was destroyed a few years later by fire. Explanation: ‘…when Queen Elizabeth I announced that she was going to visit’ means the visit did not happen until later. As the castle was not in good condition (it was ‘run down’), the guest rooms were not repaired. Instead, they made a new house for her, next to the main hall. Later this house (but NOT the main hall) was destroyed by fire. The answer is B. Answer: B 12. Answer: C an entertainment company. In 1982, the castle was sold to Here’s what the speaker says: In the seventeenth century the castle belonged to the wealthy Fenys family, who enlarged it and made it more comfortable. However, by 1982 the Fenys family could no longer afford to maintain the castle, even though they received government support, and they put it on the market. It was eventually taken over by a company who owned a number of amusement parks, but when we get there I think you’ll see that they’ve managed to retain the original atmosphere of the castle. Explanation: The castle belonged to the Fenys family, but ‘by 1982’, they could ‘no longer afford it’, and they had to sell it, or ‘put it on the market’. The castle only ‘received government support’ and did not belong to the government. The castle was then ‘taken over’ by a company, which means it was sold to the company. As this company ‘owned a number of amusement parks’, we can take it that it is an entertainment company. Answer: C. 13. Answer: C see models of historical figures moving and talking. In some of the rooms, visitors can Here’s what the speaker says: When you go inside, you’ll find that in the state rooms there are life-like moving wax models dressed in costumes of different periods in the past, which even carry on conversations together. As well as that, in every room there are booklets giving information about what the room was used for and the history of the objects and furniture it contains. Explanation: ‘Some of the rooms’ refers to the ‘state rooms’, and the ‘models of historical figures’ are the ‘life-like moving wax models’, not real actors, which can ‘carry on conversations’ – or talking, which refers to answer C. There is no information about interactions with those actors, so B is not the answer. The guest can find information about the history in ‘booklets’, not by talking to experts as no expert is mentioned. So A is not the answer. C is the correct answer. Answer: C. 14. Answer: B go to an art exhibition. In the castle park, visitors can Here’s what the speaker says: The castle park’s quite extensive. At one time, sheep were kept there, and in the nineteenth century the owners had a little zoo with animals like rabbits and even baby elephant. Nowadays the old zoo buildings are used for public displays of paintings and sculpture. The park also has some beautiful trees, though the oldest of all, which dated back 800 years, was sadly blown down in 1987. Explanation: ‘At one time’ the owner had a little zoo means it only existed in the past. The ‘800 years’ tree was ‘blown down’ in 1987 and visitors cannot see it now. So we can only see the ‘paintings and sculpture’ that are displayed in public ‘nowadays’. Answer: B. 15. Answer: A afternoon tea in the conservatory. At the end of the visit, the group will have Here’s what the speaker says: Now, you’re free to wander around on your own until 4.30, but then at the end of our visit we’ll all meet together at the bottom of the Great Staircase. We’ll then go on to the long gallery, where there’s a wonderful collection of photographs showing the family who owned the castle a hundred years ago having tea and cakes in the conservatory – and we’ll then take you to the same place, where afternoon tea will be served to you. Explanation: At the end, the group will ‘meet together’ at the Great Staircase, then see a ‘collection of photographs’ of the castle’s owners ‘a hundred years ago’, so the owners are no longer there. The group will have tea at ‘the same place’, which is the conservatory where owners had tea and cakes referred to in the previous sentence, so the answer is A. Answer: A. 16. Answer: H Starting point for walking the walls Here’s what the speaker says: The starting point’s quite near the main entrance – walk straight down the path until you get to the South gate, and it’s just there. Explanation: When the speaker says it’s quite near, we should look at the area around the main entrance. Going ‘straight down’ from the main entrance to reach the ‘south gate’, we can easily find the starting point ‘just there’ at the letter H. Answer: H. 17. Answer: D Bow and arrow display Here’s what the speaker says: There’ll shortly be a show in which you can see archers displaying their skill with a bow and arrow. The quickest way to get there is to take the first left after the main entrance and follow the path past the bridge, then you’ll see it in front of you at the end. Explanation: The ‘quickest way’ is from the main entrance, take the ‘first left’ then follow the path, which indicates that we should continue to go straight until we ‘pass the bridge’, not crossing it, to the end, the answer is D. Candidates should get used to some phrases showing direction such as “take the first/ second left”, “turn”, “go straight” or “follow”. Answer: D. 18. Answer: F Hunting birds display Here’s what the speaker says: If you like animals there’s also a display of hunting birds – falcons and eagles and so on. If you go from the main entrance in the direction of the south gate, but turn right before you get there instead of going through it, you’ll see it on your right past the first tower. Explanation: We need to identify where the speaker is talking about, so we know what we are listening to. When he mentions animals, it should be about the hunting birds display, as there is no other places related to animals. From the ‘main entrance’ in the direction of the ‘South gate’ means go straight, ‘turn right before you get there instead of going through it’ implies that we take the first right, the display is ‘right past the first tower’, so it will be near the ‘first tower’ at F. Answer: F. 19. Answer: A Traditional dancing Here’s what the speaker says: At 3 pm there’s a short performance of traditional dancing on the outdoor stage. That’s right at the other side of the castle from the entrance, and over the bridge. It’s about ten minutes’ walk or so. Explanation: ‘…..at the other side of the castle from the entrance’ means it’s opposite the entrance, and ‘over the bridge’, which is at A. Answer: A. 20. Answer: E Shop Here’s what the speaker says: And finally the shop. It’s actually inside one of the towers, but the way in is from the outside. Just take the first left after the main entrance, go down the path and take the first right. It’s got some lovely gifts and souvenirs. Explanation: The instruction is to ‘take the first left after the main entrance’, so we follow the path then take the ‘first right’. We can easily find it at E. Answer: E. SECTION 3 21. Answer: B with a timeline showing when woolly mammoths lived How will Rosie and Martin introduce their presentation? Here’s what the speakers say: ROSIE: Maybe we could show a video clip of a cartoon about mammoths. But that’d be a bit childish. Or we could have a diagram, it could be a timeline to show when they lived, with illustrations? MARTIN: Or we could just show a drawing of them walking in the ice? No, let’s go with your last suggestion. Explanation: Rosie and Martin discuss using a ‘video clip’ of a ‘cartoon’ about mammoths, but they decide not to do this, so C is not the answer. There’s a suggestion that they could show ‘a drawing’ of mammoth walking in the ice, but this is dismissed and they go with the ‘last suggestion’, which is ‘a timeline’ to show when mammoths lived. So, the answer is B. Answer: B. 22. Answer: C It was not as old as mammoth remains from elsewhere. What was surprising about the mammoth tooth found by Russel Graham? Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: So why was that significant? ROSIE: Well the mammoth bones previously found on the North American mainland were much less recent than that. So this was really amazing. Explanation: The adjectives ‘significant’ and “amazing” can be considered as ‘surprising’, and it is because the bones previously found in North America were ‘much less recent’, or much older, than the one found by Russel Graham. Therefore, this tooth was not as old as mammoth remains in other places in North America. Before that, they mentioned “jawbone”, but it was before the question, so it is not the reason why it is surprising. Answer: C. 23. Answer: A became isolated on the island. The students will use an animated diagram to demonstrate how the mammoths Here’s what the speakers say: MARTIN: Then we’re making an animated diagram to show the geography of the area in prehistoric times. So originally, St Paul’s island wasn’t an island, it was connected to the mainland, and mammoths and other animals like bears were able to roam around the whole area. ROSIE: Then the climate warmed up and the sea level began to rise, and the island got cut off from the mainland. So those mammoths on the island couldn’t escape: they had to stay on the island. Explanation: The climate changes meant that the island ‘got cut off’ from the mainland and the mammoths ‘couldn’t escape’, which indicates that they were isolated – to be alone or apart from others, so the answer is A. Previously, Martin mentioned other animals, but he refers merely to animals living in that area, not about them coexisting together, so C is not correct,. Answer: A. 24. Answer: A how exact it is According to Martin, what is unusual about the date of the mammoths’ extinction on the island? Here’s what the speaker says: MARTIN: They concluded that the extinction happened 5600 years ago, which is a very precise time for a prehistoric extinction. Explanation: The estimated time for this extinction is considered as ‘very precise’, which means that it is ‘very exact’. “Very” is a way to emphasise the adjective which follows. Although Martin explains how this date was calculated/established (by analysing samples found in the mud and DNA from mammoths), there is nothing unusual about this method. So, C is not the answer. Nothing is mentioned about how “early” this extinction was, so B is also incorrect. The answer is A. Answer: A. 25. Answer: E Introduction Here’s what the speakers say: MARTIN: So for the introduction, we’re using a visual, so once we’ve prepared that we’re done. ROSIE: I’m not sure. I think we need to write down all the ideas we want to include here, not just rely on memory. How we begin the presentation is so important. MARTIN: You’re right. Explanation: The statement ‘write down all the ideas we want to include’ implies that the students should make detailed notes for the introduction. Martin mentioned visual, and he thought that they only needed that, but Rosie did not agree with him and suggested using notes. Martin agrees with her. However, she also didn’t say anything about reducing visual input, candidates should be careful, not mistaking the answer for B. Answer: E 26. Answer: D Discovery of the mammoth tooth Here’s what the speaker says: ROSIE: The discovery of the mammoth tooth is probably the most dramatic part, but we don’t have that much information, only what we got from the online article. I thought maybe we could get in touch with the researcher who led the team and ask him to tell us a bit more. Explanation: Rosie mentions “online”, but they did not get enough information from the online article. Therefore, do research online is not the answer. Rosie suggests that they should ‘get in touch’ with the researcher, which has a similar meaning to ‘contact’ the researcher, so the answer is clearly D. Answer: D. 27. Answer: A Initial questions asked by the researchers Here’s what the speaker says: ROSIE: We could ask the audience to suggest some questions about it and then see how many of them we can answer. Explanation: Involving the audience by enabling them to ‘suggest some questions’ then ‘answer’ them will increase interaction of both sides, and thus make the presentation ‘more interactive’. So, the answer is A. Answer: A. 28. Answer: H Further research carried out on the island Here’s what the speakers say: MARTIN: Then the section on further research carried out on the island – analysing mud in the lake. I wonder if we’re actually got too much information here, should we cut some? ROSIE: I don’t think so, but it’s all a bit muddled at present. MARTIN: Yes, maybe it would be better if it followed a chronological pattern. Explanation: ‘Chronological pattern’ means following the order in which a series of events happened. The students also mention that the presentation is a bit ‘muddled’, which basically means disorganized, so here they intend to arrange the content of the presentation more clearly. The answer is H. Answer: H. 29. Answer: G Findings and possible explanation Here’s what the speaker says: ROSIE: The findings and possible explanations section is just about ready, but we need to practise it so we’re sure it won’t overrun. Explanation: To overrun is to go beyond expected or allowed time, so this means the students are trying to ensure that their presentation won’t exceed the time limit. When it’s related to the time, it means they have to check timing, which is answer G. Answer: G. 30. Answer: C Relevance to the present day Here’s what the speaker says: TUTOR: In the last section, relevance to the present day, you’ve got some good ideas but this is where you need to move away from the ideas of others and give your own viewpoint. Explanation: The tutor is advising the students to ‘move away from the ideas of others’ and ‘give your own viewpoint’, which means they should express their personal opinion in their presentation. Candidates should be aware of some synonyms such as opinion, point of view, viewpoint, idea, perspective, etc. as the question won’t use the same words that are used in the conversation we are listening to. The answer is C. Answer: C. SECTION 4 31. Answer: dances many cultures invented … and other ceremonies to make the weather god friendly Here’s what the speaker says: Many ancient civilisations developed rites such as dances in order to make the weather gods look kindly on them. Explanation: ‘Cultures’ and ‘civilisations’, and ‘invented’ and ‘developed’ have similar meanings, and ‘make the gods look kindly on them’ refers to the gods treating them in a friendly way. So by comparing the identical words, we get the answer for this question: ‘dances’. Answer: dances 32. Answer: survival people needed to observe and interpret the sky to ensure their … Here’s what the speaker says: But the weather was of daily importance: observing the skies and drawing the correct conclusions these observations was really important, in fact their survival depended on it. Explanation: To ‘draw the correct conclusions” of the observations of the sky also means to interpret them correctly, and ‘their survival depended on it’ implies that they needed to do whatever they could to survive, which can be understood as they needed to ensure their survival. Answer: survival 33. Answer: clouds Around 650 BC, Babylonians started forecasting, using weather phenomena such as … Here’s what the speaker says: It isn’t known when the people first started to observe the skies, but around 650 BC, the Babylonians produced the first short-range weather forecasts, based on their observations of cloudsand other phenomena. Explanation: Listen for the date and the word ‘Babylonians’. The statement: ‘produced the first weather forecasts’ can be interpreted as ‘started forecasting’, by observing ‘clouds and other phenomena’. Clouds is the answer. Answer: clouds 34. Answer: festivals By 300 BC, the Chinese had a calendar made up of a number of…………. connected with the weather. Here’s what the speaker says: The Chinese also recognised weather patterns, and by 300 BC, astronomers had developed a calendar which divided the year into 24 festivals, each associated with a different weather phenomenon. Explanation: Listen for the date (300 BC) and the word ‘Chinese’. The statement: ‘associated with a different weather phenomenon’ means ‘connected with the weather’, and according to the speaker, a calendar consists of a number of festivals, or 24 to be exact. Answer: festivals 35. Answer: comets Aristotle also described haloes and … Here’s what the speaker says: He also described celestial phenomena such as haloes – that is, bright circles of light around the sun, the moon and bright stars – and comets. Explanation: Aristotle had described two types of celestial phenomena – things which can be observed in the sky – haloes and comets. So, the answer is comets. Answer: comets 36. Answer: sky many proverbs, e.g about the significant colour of the … , passed on accurate information. Here’s what the speaker says: Alongside this, though, in the Middle Ages weather observations were passed on in the form of proverbs, such as ‘Red sky at night, shepherd’s delight; red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’. Explanation: The weather observations of the people in the Middle Ages had given birth to many proverbs which were passed on through generations. One of them is: “Red sky at night, shepherd’s delight; red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning”. The colour ‘red’ in the example of the proverb is used to describe the sky, so the answer is pretty clear. Answer: sky 37. Answer: instruments 15th century: scientists recognised value of … for the first time. Here’s what the speaker says: For centuries, any attempt to forecast the weather could only be based on personal observations, but in the fifteenth century scientists began to see the need for instruments. Explanation: The word ‘began’ indicates ‘for the first time’, and ‘the need for instruments’ can be understood as the recognition for the ‘value’ of it. So the answer is instruments. Answer: instruments 38. Answer: thermometer Galileo invented the … Here’s what the speaker says: In 1592, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo developed the world’s first thermometer. Explanation: Listen for the name ‘Galileo’. The speaker mentions in the text that in 1592, Galileo ‘developed the first thermometer’, which means that he invented the thing. So the answer is thermometer. Answer: thermometer 39. Answer: storms 18th century: Franklin identified the movement of … Here’s what the speaker says: It was Franklin who discovered that storms generally travel from west to east. Explanation: The term ‘travel from west to east’ indicates movement, and ‘discovered’ has a similar meaning to ‘identified’. The answer is therefore ‘storm’. Answer: storm 40. Answer: telegraph 19th century: data from different locations could be sent to the same place by … Here’s what the speaker says: People in different locations began to keep records, and in the mid-nineteenth century, the invention of the telegraph made it possible for these records to be collated. Explanation: The word ‘collated’ means that records could be collected and ‘sent to the same place”, and the different ‘records’ refers to the ‘data’ from various locations. All of this happened because of the invention of telegraph, which is also the answer to the question. Answer: telegraph",

      "content_clean": "SECTION 1 1. Answer: Canadian Nationality Here’s what the speakers say: OFFICER: Ok, thank you. And are you resident in the UK? LOUISE: No, I’m actually Canadian, though my mother was British Explanation: When the officer asks about residence, we can tell that they are talking about nationality, which is the answer required for Question 1, so we should focus here. Although the officer mentions the UK, Louise’s answer is ‘NO’, meaning that British is not the answer. She is Canadian, so the correct answer is Canadian. Louise also mentions her mom being British. This is a trick and candidates need to be careful: there will be more than one piece of information that can potentially be the answer. Answer: Canadian 2. Answer: furniture Reason for visit: business (to buy antique …) Here’s what the speakers say: OFFICER: So you’re just visiting the country? LOUISE: That’s right. I come over most summers on business. I’m an interior designer and I come over to buy old furniture, antiques you know. Explanation: The question of the officer is to confirm Louise’ purpose to stay and visit the country. Her answer is that she comes over on business, which is already put in the note. Therefore, we expect she will explain further after that answer, so we should focus here. As the word needed is behind the adjective “antique”, it should be a noun, referring to something rare and old. The answer is “furniture”. Answer: furniture 3. Answer: Park Current Address: … Apartments (No 15) Here’s what the speakers say: OFFICER: So may I ask where you are staying now? LOUISE: Well at present I’ve got a place at Park Apartments, that’s on King Street. I was staying at the Riverside Apartments on the same street, but the apartment there was only available for six weeks so I had to find another one. Explanation: We need to listen to the questions from the officer as these questions will let us know what information will come up next. This question is about where Louise is staying now, so it’s about her current address. Candidates need to be aware that it is “current” address, which means where she is staying at present, not in the past. Therefore, the answer is Park. Candidates should note down information that they can hear in the first place, after that, when the speaker explains further, candidates can compare the information they had with the new information to see which particular piece of information is needed. There will often be information that is included just to confuse candidates. Answer: Park 4. Answer: 250 (sterling) Items stolen: a wallet containing approximately £ … Here’s what the speakers say: OFFICER: And what did your wallet have in it? LOUISE: Well, fortunately I don’t keep my credit cards in that wallet – I keep them with my passport in an inside compartment in my backpack. But there was quite a bit of cash there…about £250 sterling, I should think. I withdrew £300 from my account yesterday, but I did a bit of shopping, so I must have already spent about £50 of that. Explanation: Candidates should get used to a few common currency names, symbols and codes. For example, the official currency of the UK is the pound sterling, also known as pound or sterling (symbol: £, ISO code: GBP) so they do not get confused in some situations like this. At first Louise mentions her credit cards and passport, but she claims that she does not keep them in that wallet but in her backpack. When you see the symbol £, you would know you have to listen to the information about cash. The answer is 250, although there is some additional information that is confusing like “withdrew 300” and “spent 50”. Therefore, it is not just the amount of cash that should candidates pay attention to, but also the actions of Louise in the script. Answer: 250 (sterling) 5. Answer: phone Items stolen: – a … Here’s what the speaker says: LOUISE: At first I thought, oh I must have left the wallet back in the apartment, but then I realized my phone had gone as well. Explanation: As Question 5 is also in the part of “items stolen”, the answer will not be far away from the answer for Question 4. Right after talking about his wallet, Louise went on to talk about his phone. “Had gone” implies “had been lost”, and “as well” implies it is in the same as his wallet, which means it is stolen. The answer is “phone”. Answer: phone 6. Answer: 10(th) September Date of theft Here’s what the speakers say: OFFICER: So you say the theft occurred yesterday? LOUISE: Yes. OFFICER: So that was September the tenth. Explanation: The question of the officer tells us that he is asking about the time/ date of the theft. Candidates can note down “yesterday”, in case speakers do not explain further than that. However, the officer points out the exact date of “yesterday”, which is “September the tenth”. Candidates should be aware of different ways to express dates and times. Answer: 10(th) September/September 10th 7. Answer: museum Location: outside the … at about 4pm Here’s what the speakers say: OFFICER: Do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might possibly been stolen? LOUISE: Well at first I couldn’t believe […] Anyway, I met up with a friend, and we spent a couple of hours in the museum. But I do remember that as we were leaving there, at about 4 o’clock, a group of young boys ran up to us, and they were really crowding around us, and they were asking us what time it was, and all of a sudden they ran off. Explanation: After the question of the officer about the possible location of the theft, Louise talks a lot about how she feels, but has not mentioned any location. Candidates need to be careful not to lose their concentration. Then Louise mentions the museum where she met up with a friend, and when they were leaving, which means they were outside the place, it was about 4pm – the time in the question. Therefore, the answer is “museum”. Answer: museum 8. Answer: time Some boys asked for the … and ran off. Here’s what the speaker says: LOUISE: […] a group of young boys ran up to us, and they were really crowding around us, and they were asking us what time it was, and all of a sudden they ran off. Explanation: The answer for Question 8 comes right after the answer for Question 7. That’s why candidates need to spend time to look at questions before listening and get a gist of what kind of information they need for each question, so they know where to focus on. “A group of young boys” refers to “some boys”, and they asked for the time. The answer is “time”. Answer: time 9. Answer: blond(e) he was about 12, slim build with … hair Here’s what the speakers say: OFFICER: Any idea of how old he might have been? LOUISE: Around twelve years old? OFFICER: And can you remember anything else about his appearance? LOUISE: Not much. He was quite thin… OFFICER: Colour of hair? LOUISE: I do remember that – he was blond. Explanation: With previous questions and answers given, we know that the speakers are talking about the boy in Question 9. Louise says that the boy who talked most was about 12 years old, and thin (slim build). And then the officer asked for his colour of hair, so we need to listen to find out a colour, and it was “blond”. Blond is the correct answer. Answer: blond/blonde 10. Answer: 8795482361 Crime reference number allocated Here’s what the speaker says: OFFICER: So what I’m going to do now is give you a crime reference number so you can contact your insurance company. So this is ten digits: 87954 82361. Explanation: This is not a difficult question. Candidates should focus on words like “number” or “digits”. In this case, the speaker makes it simple by saying it correctly right at the first time. Sometimes, in IELTS Listening, they can make it a bit more difficult by intentionally making a mistake and change one or two digits. Therefore, you should be careful and concentrate until you are sure that they move on to the next part of the conversation. Answer: 87954 82361 SECTION 2 11-12. Answer: A get to know colleagues, C ask lots of questions Which TWO pieces of advice for the first week of an apprenticeship does the manager give? Here’s what the speaker says: I’d like to start with some advice about being an apprentice. Most of you have very little or no experience of working for a big organization and the first week or so may be quite challenging. There will be a lot of new information to take in but don’t worry too much about trying to remember everything. The important thing is to check with someone if you are not sure what to do – you’ll find your supervisor is very approachable and won’t mind explaining things or helping you out. You’re here to learn so make the most of that opportunity. You’ll be spending time in different departments during your first week so make an effort to talk to as many people as possible about their work – you’ll make some new friends and find out lots of useful information. Explanation: With this kind of question, make sure that you understand all the choices you have before listening, as the speaker will paraphrase it and say it in a different way. The number of choices may confuse you if you do not know them well. The first piece of advice is do not worry too much, which is not one of the answers. After that, the speaker says “the important thing”, implying what she thinks they should do, in other words she gives her advice. It is “to check with someone if you are not sure what to do”. To check with someone means you have to ask them questions. To make it clearer, the speaker tells people to “make the most of that opportunity”, so she does not limit the number of questions they can ask. In fact, it implies that they can ask as much as they can (make most of something = to use or enjoy something as much as possible), or “ask lots of questions”. So the first answer is C. The speaker then goes on and tells them to “make an effort”, in other words, “try” to “talk to as many people as possible about their work”. Talking to people working with you is to know more about them, to make friends with them or, more generally “get to know colleagues”, which is answer A. Answer: C, A (in either order) 13-14. Answer: B making career plans, E reviewing progress Which TWO things does the manager say mentors can help with? Here’s what the speaker says: As well as having a supervisor, you will each be assigned a mentor. This person will be someone who’s recently completed an apprenticeship and you will meet with them on a weekly basis. Their role is to provide help and support throughout your apprenticeship. Of course, this does not mean they will actually do any of your work for you – instead they will be asking you about what goals you’ve achieved so far, as well as helping you to identify any areas for improvement. You can also discuss your more long-term ambitions with them as well. Explanation: The speaker mentions the word ‘mentor’, so we can expect that she will explain further about the role of mentors, which is the answer for Question 13 and 14. She may say some words used in the answers like “complete” or “weekly”, but in a different context, so be careful, especially because in IELTS Listening, it is common that they will paraphrase the words you hear in the script. So you will not hear exactly the same words. The role of mentors is “asking you about what goals you’ve achieved so far”, and “identify any areas for improvement”. This means that they will help you to reflect on what you have done and what you can improve during the apprenticeship, in other words, they help you “review progress”. E is therefore one correct answer. After that, “you can also discuss” means they will also help you, about “long-term ambitions”. It is an apprenticeship so the ambitions discussed should be about job and career. It refers to “career plans” here. So, B is another correct answer. There is no information about confidence (answer A), difficult tasks (answer C) or timetable (answer D). Answer: B, E (in either order) 15. Answer: B Using the internet Here’s what the speaker says Most importantly, the internet. As part of your job you will be doing some research online so obviously you will have unlimited access for that but please don’t use it for personal use – you’ll have your own phones for that. Explanation It is clear that the speaker is talking about the internet. She claims they will use it as part of job and so they will have unlimited access, which may lead candidates to a misunderstanding that it is encouraged. However, candidates need to pay attention to a connector of contrast like “but”, as it implies something opposite to what she just said. She asked them not to use it for personal use, which is a restriction – they can only use the internet for work. B is the answer Answer: B. 16. Answer: B Flexible working Here’s what the speaker says: Some of you have already asked me about flexible working. After your probationary three-month period – some of you will be eligible for this – but it will depend on which department you’re in and what your personal circumstances are. Explanation The speaker says “some of you”, implying not every apprentice will be eligible for flexible working. Also, she claims that it depends on “department” and “personal circumstances”. Therefore, clearly it is not encouraged and it is also not against the rules. We can say there are some restrictions on this. B is the answer. Answer: B. 17. Answer: C Booking holidays Here’s what the speaker says: I want to make sure there is no confusion about our holiday policy. Apart from any statutory public holidays we ask that you don’t book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished. Explanation “Holiday policy” refers to “booking holidays”, and the speaker asks them not to book any holiday in their apprenticeship, which means booking holidays is not allowed, or it is against the rules. C is the answer Answer: C 18. Answer: A Working overtime Here’s what the speaker says: You’ll be expected to work a 40-hour week but there may be opportunities to do overtime during busy periods. Although you’re not required to do this, it can be a valuable experience – so we advise you to take it up if possible. Explanation The speaker claims that working overtime is not compulsory, but she talks about it in a positive way by calling it “a valuable experience” and advises apprentices to “take it up if possible”. This means that it is encouraged and so A is the answer. Answer: A. 19. Answer: A Wearing trainers Here’s what the speaker says: As you know, we don’t have a formal dress code here – you may wear casual clothes as long as they are practical – and the only restriction for shoes we have is on high heels for health and safety reasons. Comfortable shoes like trainers are preferable. Explanation The speaker claims they do not have a formal dress code and they only have one restriction, which is not to wear high heels. Question 19 is about trainers, so B is not the answer. Trainers are “preferable”. “Preferable” can be considered as “encouraged”. So the answer is A. Answer: A. 20. Answer: C Bringing food to work Here’s what the speaker says: Snacks and drinks are also provided – so we’ve decided to introduce a no packed lunch policy. Explanation “A no packed lunch policy” means no one is allowed to bring food to work. The speaker mentions a canteen on the company site and explains why a packed lunch is not allowed. Therefore, it is against the rules. C is the answer. Answer: C. SECTION 3 21. Answer: B include most of the world’s largest cities. Carla and Rob were surprised to learn that coastal cities Here’s what the speakers say: ROB: And cities are growing so quickly – I mean, we know that more than half the world’s population lives in cities now. CARLA: Yeah, though that’s all cities, not just ones on the coast. But most of the biggest cities are actually built by the sea. Explanation Rob mentions “half the world’s population” living in cities, which may be mistaken for Answer A. However, it is about all cities, not just the coastal cities. Therefore, it is not the correct answer. They don’t discuss how fast coastal cities are growing compared with other cities, so C is also incorrect. Carla claims that most of the biggest cities, in other words the largest ones, are “built by the sea”, which means they are coastal cities. So B is the correct answer. Answer: B. 22. Answer: A may bring pollution to the cities. p According to Rob, building coastal cities near to rivers Here’s what the speaker says: ROB: As the city expands, agriculture and industry tend to spread further inland along the rivers, and so agriculture moves even further inland up the river. That’s not necessarily a problem, except it means more and more pollutants are discharged into the rivers. Explanation The speaker talks about the expansion of cities and the fact that agriculture and industry move further inland, which can refer to Answer A and C. However, he claims that this expansion inland is not a problem. However, Rob emphasizes the fact that one consequence is that, more pollutants are discharged into the rivers. Pollutants are subtances that pollute, so we can say building coastal cities near to rivers brings more pollution to the city. A is the correct answer. Answer: A. 23. Answer: C They did not allow for the effects of climate change. What mistake was made when building water drainage channels in Miami in the 1950s? Here’s what the speakers say: ROB: Did you read that article about Miami, on the east coast of the USA? CARLA: No ROB: Well, apparently back in the 1950s they built channels to drain away the water in case of flooding. CARLA: Sounds sensible ROB: Yes, they spend quite a lot of money on them. But what they didn’t take into account was global warming. Explanation We should pay attention when Rob mentions Miami (proper nouns are not hard to listen for, so we can take advantage to locate the answers). He continues by talking about channels to drain away water, which refers to “water drainage channels”. As the question is about “mistakes”, we expect the speaker will use connectors of contrast, therefore we should focus more when he says “but” – there is a high chance the answer is after that, and it was “global warming”, referring to the effects of climate change. The correct answer is C. Answer: C. 24. Answer: B pay for a new flood prevention system What do Rob and Carla think that the authorities in Miami should do immediately? Here’s what the speakers say: CARLA: So what are the authorities doing about it now? ROB: I don’t know. I did read that they are aiming to stop disposing of waste water into the ocean over the next ten years. CARLA: But that won’t help with flood prevention now, will it? ROB: No. Really they just need to find the money for something to replace the drainage channels, in order to protect against flooding now. But in the long term they need to consider the whole ecosystem. Explanation Rob and Carla are talking about the authories and mention “stop disposing of waste water”, which is answer C. However, that is what the authorities will be doing in the future, while the question is about what the speakers think the authorities should do now/immediately. Action on restoring ecosystems is a long term measure, so A is not true. Therefore, we need to look for their opinion, which is “find something to replace the drainage channels”, referring to a new system, and it is to prevent flooding. Therefore, B is the answer. Answer: B. 25. Answer: A greater coordination of activities What do they agree should be the priority for international action? Here’s what the speakers say: CARLA: Really, though, coastal cities can’t deal with their problems on their own, can they ? I mean, they’ve got to start acting together at an international level instead of just doing their own things. ROB: Absolutely. The thing is, everyone knows what the problems are and environmentalists have a pretty good idea of what we should be doing about them, so they should be able to work together to some extent. But it’s going to be a long time before countries come to a decision on what principles they’re prepared to abide by. Explanation Carla mentions “international level” so we can expect the answer for Question 25 will come next. What Rob thinks is environmentalists should “work together”, which refers to “coordination”. He does not specifically point out what they should do like sharing information or agreeing on shared policies, although the fact that he mentions principles may confuse candidates. A is the answer. Answer: A 26. Answer: B historical background Here’s what the speaker says: ROB: So I suppose we will begin with some general historical background about why coastal cities were established. But we don’t want to spend too long on that, the other students will already know a bit about it. It’s all to do with communications and so on. Explanation In this kind of question, speakers will quickly talk about each part, which is each question, so candidates need to know the choices very well in order to decide on the correct answer. For example, about historical background, Rob said they didn’t want to spend too long on that, which means this part should not be too long, or they will “keep it short”. The answer is B. Answer: B. 27. Answer: A geographical factors Here’s what the speakers say: CARLA: We should mention some geographical factors, things like wetlands and river estuaries and coastal erosion and so on. We could have some maps of different cities with these features marked. ROB: On a handout you mean? Or some slides everyone can see? CARLA: That’d be better. Explanation Carla thinks that they should have some maps of different cities with geographical factors marked. They discuss presenting these maps on a handout. This suggests answer E, but be careful, because that is not correct. Rob then suggests using slides that everyone can see (visuals – answer A), and Carla agrees that this would be better than a handout. Therefore, A is the correct answer. Answer: A. 28. Answer: F past mistakes Here’s what the speakers say: ROB: It’d be good to go into past mistakes in a bit more detail. Did you read that case study of the problems there were in New Orleans with flooding a few years ago? CARLA: Yes, we could use that as the basis for that part of the talk. […] ROB: OK. So that’s probably enough background. Explanation Rob mentions a case study of past mistakes and Carla decides that they can use “that”, meaning the case study, as the basis for that part of the talk, which means they will focus on it (basis – the most important facts which something is developed). A case study can be considered as an example. Rob then agrees with Carla’s decision (OK. That’s probably enough background). Therefore, F is the answer for this question. Answer: F. 29. Answer: G future risks Here’s what the speakers say: ROB: OK. What else do we need to talk about? Maybe something on future risks, looking more at the long term, if populations continue to grow. CARLA: Yeah. We will need to do a bit of work there. I haven’t got much information, have you? ROB: No. We’ll need to look at some websites. Shouldn’t take too long. CARLA: OK. Explanation Carla and Rob admit that they haven’t got much information. He suggests that they should “look at some websites”, which means they have to do it online, and to know more about future risks, they have do some research. So we can understand his idea as “do online research”, which is answer G. Answer: G. 30. Answer: C international implications Here’s what the speaker says: CARLA: And I think we should end by talking about international implications. Maybe we could ask people in the audience. Explanation To ask people in the audience means to get people involved in their presentation. And ‘people’ here refers to other students. Therefore, to talk about internation implications, they’re going to involve other students. C is the answer. Answer: C. SECTION 4 31. Answer: industry More energy required because of growth in population and … Here’s what the speaker says: ‘Demand is rising rapidly, because of the world’s increasing population and expanding industry’. Explanation Question 31 is in the introduction part, so the answer is probably in the first part of the speech. We pay attention here: “demand is rising” refers to “more energy required” and two reasons that the speaker points out are “increasing population” and “expanding industry”. Population is already mentioned, so the expansion of industry is the other reason why more energy is needed. The word ‘growth’ in the question is the same as ‘increase/expansion’. What we need is just ONE WORD (in this case, a noun): industry. Answer: industry. 32. Answer: constant Advantage: waves provide a … source of renewable energy Here’s what the speaker says: ‘First, wave energy. […] This form of energy has plenty of potential, as the source is constant. And there’s no danger of waves coming to a standstill. Electricity can be generated using onshore systems, using a reservoir, or offshore systems. But […]’ Explanation When the speaker says “potential”, we know that he is talking about the advantage. He claims the source is “constant”. After that, the speaker explains a bit further and moves on to disadvantages by saying “but”. Therefore, there is no other information that we need to take into account. Constant is the answer. Answer: constant. 33. Answer: direction Problems: – waves can move in any … Here’s what the speaker says: ‘But the problem with ocean waves is that they are erratic, with the wind making them travel in any direction’. Explanation: As explained in Question 32, after the connector “but”, the speaker is going to talk about disadvantages, or problems. “Travel” can be understood as “move”, and waves travel in any direction. So direction is the answer we are looking for. Answer: direction. 34. Answer: floor Problems: movement of sand, etc., on the …….. of the ocean may be affected Here’s what the speaker says: ‘Another drawback is that sand and other sediments on the ocean floor might be stopped from flowing normally, which can lead to environmental problems’. Explanation Candidates should be aware of what information they need for each answer. Question 34 is about problems of wave energy, so we have to pay attention right after Question 33. The speaker mentions sand and other sediments, which can be understood as “etc.”, and they are stopped from flowing normally, which means their movements are affected. They are “on the ocean floor”, in other words, “on the floor of the ocean”. So floor is the answer. Answer: floor. 35. Answer: predictable Tides are more … than waves Here’s what the speaker says: ‘The second category of marine energy that I’ll mention is tidal energy. One major advantage of using the tide, rather than waves, as a source of energy is that it’s predictable’. Explanation In the question we can see it is in the comparative form of adjectives, so we have to listen to a comparison between tides and waves. The speaker talks about one advantage of tides, “rather than waves”, which refers to something it is better than waves. And tides are unlike waves because they are “predictable”. The answer is predictable. Answer: predictable. 36. Answer: bay Planned tidal lagoon in Wales: will be created in a … in Swansea Here’s what the speaker says: ‘One current plan is to create a tidal lagoon on the coast of Wales. This will be an area of water within a bay at Swansea’. Explanation In the task of completing notes, candidates should pay attention to the titles of each part, as it will tell you where the answer belongs to, where to focus on. The speaker mentions a tidal lagoon in Wales, so we know the answer will be somewhere after that. It is in a bay at Swansea, so bay is the answer. Proper nouns such as Wales or Swansea are also what we should focus on to locate the answer. Answer: bay 37. Answer: gates stored water is released through … , driving the turbine in the reverse direction. Here’s what the speaker says: ‘Then, in order to release the stored water, gates in the breakwater are opened. It pours powerfully out of the lagoon, driving the turbines in the breakwater in the opposite direction […]’ Explanation When the speaker says “in order to release the stored water”, we can expect he will mention a method or a tool, an object that can support releasing the stored water. That object should be the answer (as the word we are looking for is after “through”, implying an object or a method). Additionally, the speaker explains further about how it works to drive the turbine in the opposite direction, which is the same as in the reverse direction. Therefore, we can be sure that this is what we are looking for: “gates” is the object that is mentioned. Gates is the answer. Answer: gates. 38. Answer: fuel Advantage: no … required to make it work Here’s what the speaker says: ‘This system has quite a lot in its favour: unlike solar and wind energy it doesn’t depend on the weather; the turbines are operated without the need for fuel’. Explanation When you say something has quite a lot in its favour, you are talking about its advantages, so we can pay attention here. The first advantage, that the system is not dependent on the weather, is pointed out in the note. The second advantage is it can run without fuel, in other words, it doesn’t need fuel or no fuel is required. We can see “without the need” and “not required” have the same meaning. So the answer is fuel. Answer: fuel. 39. Answer: jobs Advantage: likely to create a number of … Here’s what the speaker says ‘[…] so it doesn’t create any greenhouse emissions, and very little maintenance is needed. It’s estimated that electricity generated in this way will be relatively cheap; and that manufacturing the components would create more than 2000 jobs, a big boost to the local economy’. Explanation The speaker continues to talk about the system’s advantages, but we have to focus on something that it creates. It probably is not something negative like greenhouse emissions as we are talking about advantages. The electricity is claimed to be cheap,and there is no information about the amount of electricity will be created/ generated. Also, the word needed is behind “a number of”, which means it should be a plural noun. Therefore, the answer is “jobs”. Answer: jobs. 40. Answer: migration Problem: may harm fish and birds, e.g by affecting … and building up silt Here’s what the speaker says: ‘On the other hand, there are fears that lagoons may harm both fish and birds, for example by disturbing migration patterns, and causing a built-up of silt, affecting local ecosystems’. Explanation When the speaker says “on the other hand”, we expect he is going to talk about the system’s problems. It is not a difficult question as the speaker uses the words that are used in the question (harm fish and birds, for example and building up silt). However, candidates need to notice that the task requires ONE WORD ONLY, so the answer is “migration”, not “migration patterns”. “Disturbing” can be understood as “affecting”. Answer: migration.",

I stayed there for the first two years and then moved to where I am now. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (finance): at first = initial Explanation: The speaker says “I did my initial training in Finance”, which means he received his first training in finance. The answer is finance. 2. Answer: math(s)/mathematics Here’s what the speaker says: ALEX: I was pretty nervous to begin with. I didn’t do well in my exams at school and I was really worried because I failed Maths. But it didn’t actually matter because I did lots of courses on the job. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (Maths): didn’t have a qualification = failed Explanation: The speaker says he failed Maths at school so obviously, he did not have a qualification in Maths. The answer is math(s)/mathematics. 3. Answer: business Here’s what the speakers say: MARTHA: Did you get a diploma at the end of your trainee period? I’m hoping to do the one in business skills. ALEX: Yes. That sounds good. I took the one on IT skills but I wish I’d done that one instead. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (business): should have done = I wish I’d done Explanation: In the recording, Martha says she’s hoping to get a diploma in business and then Alex replied that he wishes he’d done that one instead of IT. [“That one” here refers to “a business diploma”, which had previously been mentioned by Martha]. The answer is business. 4. Answer: 17/seventeen Here’s what the speaker says: ALEX: There were about 20 of us who started at the same time and we were all around the same age – I was 18 and there was only one person younger than me, who was 17. The rest were between 18 and 20. I made some good friends. Explanation: The speaker says “there was only one person younger than me, who was 17”. It is clear that, among the other trainees, the youngest was 17. The answer is 17/seventeen. 5. Answer: holiday/vacation Here’s what the speakers say: MARTHA: What about pay? I know you get a lower minimum wage than regular employees. ALEX: That’s right – which isn’t great. But you get the same number of days’ holiday as everyone else. And the pay goes up massively if they offer you a job at the end of the training period. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (holiday): receive = get permanent staff = regular employees the same number ~ the same amount Explanation: Alex says that trainees get the same number of holidays (= the same amount of holiday) as everyone else, by which he means regular staff (permanent employees). The answer is holiday/vacation. 6. Answer: college Here’s what the speakers say: MARTHA: Do you have to spend any time in college? ALEX: Yes, one day each month. So you get lots of support from your tutor and your manager. Explanation: Alex tells Martha that trainees go to college one day each/per month. The answer is college. 7. Answer: location Here’s what the speakers say: MARTHA: …And the company is easy to get to, isn’t it? ALEX: Yes, it’s very close to the train station, so the location’s a real advantage. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (location): convenient = close to the train station = a real advantage Explanation: The company is easy to get to, which means that it is easy to reach. It is very close to the train station, so this is an advantage because it means that the company is in a convenient location. The answer is location. 8. Answer: jeans Here’s what the speakers say: MARTHA: I am not sure what I should wear. What do you think? ALEX: Nothing too casual – like jeans, for example. If you’ve got a nice jacket, wear that with a skirt or trousers. Explanation: Alex advises Martha not to wear clothes which are too casual (informal). He gives jeans as an example of the type of clothes which she should NOT wear. The answer is jeans. 9. Answer: late Here’s what the speakers say: MARTHA: OK. Thanks. Any other tips? ALEX: Erm, well I know it’s really obvious but arrive in plenty of time. They hate people who are late. Explanation: Another piece of advice which Alex gives Martha is that she should “arrive in plenty of time”, because the company managers “hate people who are late”. So she must not be late. The answer is late. 10. Answer: smile Here’s what the speaker says: ALEX: And one other useful piece of advice my manager told me before I had the interview for this job – is to smile. Even if you feel terrified, it makes people respond better to you. Explanation: Alex gives a final piece of advice to Martha. He says that she should make sure to smile – people will like that. The answer is smile. SECTION 2 11. Answer: A. get away from the regular trails Here’s what the speaker says: Most visitors come here for the cross-country skiing, where you’re on fairly flat ground for most of the time, rather than going down steep mountainsides. There are marked trails, but you can also leave these and go off on your own and that’s an experience not to be missed. You can go at your own speed – it’s great aerobic exercise if you really push yourself, or if you prefer you can just glide gently along and enjoy the beautiful scenery. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): get away from = leave regular trails = marked trails Explanation: The speaker says that if you want “you can just glide gently along and enjoy the beautiful scenery”. However, this is an option but not something which she specifically recommends, and therefore B is incorrect. C is also incorrect, because “going at your own speed” means choosing how fast or how slow you want to go. “Marked trails” here means regular, signposted and visible ones which are visited by many people. The speaker suggests leaving those regular trails to be on your own, and “that’s an experience not to be missed”. Therefore, the answer is A. 12. Answer: B. anyone has the chance to drive a team of dogs Here’s what the speaker says: – This afternoon, you’ll be going on a dog-sled trip. You may have seen our dogs TV recently racing in the winter sled festival. If you want, you can have your own team for the afternoon and learn how to drive them, following behind our leader on the trail. Or if you’d prefer, you can just sit back in the sled and enjoy the ride as a passenger. Explanation: Annie refers only to the race in a recent dog-sled festival, and she does not invite the group members to take part in a race, so A is incorrect. C is also incorrect, because she talks about “our leader on the trail”, so the leader will not be a group member. However, you “can have your own team for the afternoon and learn how to drive them”, so B is the answer. 13. Answer: A. all participants receive a medal Here’s what the speaker says: At the weekend, we have the team relay event, and you’re all welcome to join in. We have a local school coming along, and a lot of the teachers are taking part too. Participation rather than winning in the main focus, and there’s a medal for everyone who takes part. Participants are in teams of two or four, and each team must complete four laps of the course. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): all participants = everyone who takes part Explanation: The speaker does not mention the length of the course, but each team must complete four laps (= go round the course 4 times), so B is incorrect. Although a lot of teachers are taking part, it is not stated whether or not each team is led by a teacher, so C is also incorrect. However, everyone who takes part will receive a medal, so the answer is A. 14. Answer: C. climb to the top of a mountain Here’s what the speaker says: For your final expedition, you’ll head off to Mount Frenner wearing a pair of special snow shoes…This is an area where miners once searched for gold, though there are very few traces of their work left now. When the snow melts in summer, the mountain slopes are carpeted in flowers and plants. It’s a long ascent, though not too steep, and walkers generally take a couple of days to get to the summit and return. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): the top of a mountain = summit Explanation: The speaker says that they will visit Mount Frenner, which is “an area where miners once searched for gold”. However, they will not visit an old gold mine, because these mines no longer exist: “there are very few traces of their work left now”, so A is incorrect. The mountain slopes are covered in flowers, but there is no mention of unusual flowers, so B is incorrect. It’s a long climb to the top of the mountain, and it generally takes a couple of days to go there and return, and that is where they will go in their snow-shoes. Therefore, the answer is C. 15. Answer: A. a supply of drinking water Here’s what the speaker says: You’ll spend the night in our hut half-way up the mountain. That’s included in your package for the stay. It’s got cooking facilities, firewood and water for drinking… We can take your luggage up on our snowmobile for you for just ten dollars a person. The hut has cooking facilities so you can make a hot meal in the evening and morning, but you need to take your own food. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): drinking water = water for drinking Explanation: Visitors’ luggage can be taken up (= transported), but it costs 10 dollars, so it is not included in the cost of accommodation, so B is incorrect. You have to take your own food if you want to cook a hot meal, using the cooking facilities in the hut. Cooked food is not provided, therefore, and C is incorrect. Included in the package is drinking water, so the correct answer is A. 16. Answer: B. wait until the weather improves Here’s what the speaker says: – The weather on Mount Frenner can be very stormy. In that case, stay in the hut – generally the storms don’t last long. Don’t stress about getting back here to the centre in time to catch the airport bus – they’ll probably not be running anyway. We do have an emergency locator beacon in the hut but only use that if it’s a real emergency, like if someone’s ill or injured. Explanation: The speaker tells the visitors that they should not worry if a storm forces them to stay in the mountain hut. The airport bus from the centre will probably not be running anyway if the weather is bad. So, A is incorrect. The hut has an emergency locator beacon, but that is only to be used in case of a serious emergency, for example if someone is ill or injured. So, C is incorrect. The speaker advises them to “stay in the hut”. The storms do not last long, which means that the weather soon improves, so they should simply wait. The correct answer is B. 17. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: – Highland Trail’s directly accessible from where we are now. This trail’s been designed to give first-timers an experience that they’ll enjoy regardless of their age or skill, but it’s also ideal for experts to practise their techniques. Explanation: Annie says that the trail is suitable for both first-timers (to give them an enjoyable experience) and experts (“to practise their techniques”), meaning it’s suitable for all abilities. The correct answer is B. 18. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: – Then, there’s Pine Trail… if you’re nervous about skiing, leave this one to the experts! You follow a steep valley looking right down on the river below – scary! But if you’ve fully mastered the techniques needed for hills, it’s great fun. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (D): skill = techniques Explanation: Annie says that this trail is only for experts. If you have the skills (= “if you’ve fully mastered the techniques”), then this trail is fun. The answer is D. 19. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: – Stony Trail’s a good choice once you’ve got a general idea of the basics. There are one or two tricky sections, but nothing too challenging. There’s a shelter half-way where you can sit and take a break and enjoy the afternoon sunshine. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): stop and rest = sit and take a break Explanation: Annie mentions a shelter half-way along the trail where visitors can “sit and take a break and enjoy the afternoon sunshine”, meaning that the shelter is a good place to stop and rest. The answer is A. 20. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: – And finally, Loser’s Trail. This starts off following a gentle river valley but the last part is quite exposed so the snow conditions can be challenging – if it’s snowing or windy, check with us before you set out to make sure the trail’s open that day. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (E): bad weather = snowing or windy Explanation: Annie asks the guests to check with the centre before they set out to make sure the trail’s open that day. Part of the trail is exposed to snow and wind, so it may sometimes be closed. The answer is E. SECTION 3 21. Answer: A. He didn’t read everything on them Here’s what the speaker says: JACK: Well, I’ve always had to check labels for traces of peanuts in everything I eat because of my allergy. But beyond that I’ve never really been concerned enough to check how healthy a product is. Explanation: Jack has always checked food labels, because he cannot eat food which contains even very small amounts of peanuts. So, we can say that he considered the food labels to be important, therefore B is incorrect. C is also incorrect, because Jack does not say if he thinks the labels are complicated or not. However, although Jack read food labels, he did not check to see how healthy the food product was. Therefore, he did not read everything on the labels. Thus, the correct answer is A. 22. Answer: A. she was unaware of what certain foods contained Here’s what the speaker says: ALICE: This project has actually taught me to read the labels more carefully. I tended to believe claims on the packaging like ‘low in fat’. But I now realize that the ‘healthy’ yogurt I’ve bought for years is full of sugar and that’s actually high in calories. Explanation: Alice used to read food labels, although she now reads them more carefully, so B is incorrect. She gives the example of her ‘healthy’ yogurt, to show that she only used to pay attention to the claims on the packaging. She mentions calories, but only in order to give this example. So, C is also incorrect. Because Alice did not read the food labels carefully enough, she did not know that her ‘healthy’ yogurt in fact contained lots of sugar. She was unaware of this. Therefore, the answer is A. 23. Answer: C. the nutritional label is misleading Here’s what the speakers say: JACK: Ready meals are the worst…comparing the labels on supermarket pizzas was a real eye-opener. Did you have any idea how many calories they contain? I was amazed. ALICE: Yes, because unless you read the label really carefully, you wouldn’t know that the nutritional values given are for half a pizza. JACK: When most people eat the whole pizza. Not exactly transparent is it? Explanation: Jack and Alice are shocked by the number of calories in pizza. They are not shocked by the list of ingredients, so A is wrong. Jack tells Alice that he will certainly not stop eating pizza! So, B is incorrect. Alice says that you have to read the label carefully on pizza brands, because the supermarkets given the nutritional values are for only half a pizza. Therefore, Jack agrees that the labels are not transparent, by which he means that the nutritional label is not clear – it is misleading. The answer is C. 24. Answer: C. more comprehensive Here’s what the speaker says: JACK: I liked the traditional daily value system best – the one which tells you what proportion of your required daily intake of each ingredient the product contains. I’m not sure it’s the easiest for people to use but at least you get the full story. I like to know all the ingredients in a product – not just how much fat, salt and sugar they contain. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): comprehensive = the full story Explanation: Jack thinks that the daily value system is not very easy for people to use, so it is not more accessible compared with other systems. So, A is incorrect. While Jack thinks that all supermarkets should consistently use the same labelling system, and this would be more logical, he does not say whether the daily value system is more logical than other systems or not, so B is incorrect. Jack prefers the daily value system because it gives more information about each ingredient in the product. You “get the full story” – it is more comprehensive. The correct answer is C. 25. Answer: B. The products did not contain any meat Here’s what the speakers say: ALICE: Mmm. The labels on the different brands of chicken flavour crisps were quite revealing too, weren’t they? JACK: Yeah. I don’t understand how they can get away with calling them chicken flavour when they only contain artificial additives. ALICE: I know. I’d at least have expected them to contain a small percentage of real chicken. JACK: Absolutely. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): meat = real chicken Explanation:The speakers talk about chicken flavour crisps. They don’t say if they think the list of artificial additives is incorrect on the label, although the name on the packet is misleading. So A is incorrect. They also do not mention whether the labels list all the ingredients or not, so C is also incorrect. Jack and Alice are surprised that chicken flavour crips contain no meat (chicken). Therefore, the answer is B. 26. Answer: A. It did not produce clear results Here’s what the speakers say: ALICE: I think having nutritional food labelling has been a good idea, don’t you? I think it will change people’s behaviour and stop mothers, in particular, buying the wrong things. JACK: But didn’t that study kind of prove the opposite? People didn’t necessarily stop buying unhealthy products. ALICE: They only said that might be the case. Those findings weren’t that conclusive and it was quite a small-scale study. I think more research has to be done. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): produce clear results = conclusive Explanation: Although the study showed that people did not necessarily stop buying unhealthy products, Jack and Alice do not talk about whether the study focused on the wrong people, nor do they talk about its recommendations. Therefore, B and C are incorrect. Alice says that the study was not conclusive and more research needs to be done to obtain clear results. Thus, the answer is A. 27-28. Answer: B. The fact that it is voluntary for supermarkets, C. How little research was done before its introduction Here’s what the speakers say: JACK: What do you think of the traffic-light system? ALICE: I think supermarkets like the idea of having a colour-coded system – red, orange or green – for levels of fat, sugar and salt in a product. JACK: But it’s not been adopted universally. And not on all products.Why do you suppose that it is? ALICE: Pressure from the food manufacturers. Hardly surprising that some of them are opposed to flagging up how unhealthy their products are. JACK: I’d have thought that it would have been compulsory. It seems ridiculous it isn’t. ALICE: I know. And what I couldn’t get over is the fact that it was brought in without enough consultation – a lot of experts had deep reservations about it. JACK: That is a bit weird. I suppose there’s an argument for doing the research now when consumers are familiar with this system. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (B, C): surprised = couldn’t get over introduction = brought in little research = without enough consultation Explanation: Jack says that the traffic light system has “not been adopted universally” or on all products, so it is not widespread. A is incorrect. Alice says that the system has not been adopted by all supermarkets, probably because manufacturers don’t want their products to be considered unhealthy. However, Alice is NOT surprised that it is unpopular with manufacturers, so D is incorrect. Alice only explains the idea of the colour codes – to indicate levels of fat, sugar and salt. The speakers are not surprised about how different colours are used, so E is also incorrect. Jack does not know why the system is voluntary for supermarkets to adopt: “I’d have thought that it would have been compulsory. It seems ridiculous it isn’t”. He is therefore surprised, and asks Alice why she thinks that not all supermarkets are using it. Therefore, B is correct. C is also correct. Alice says that a lot of experts had doubts about the system when it was introduced, and there was a lack of consultation. This also surprised the students, who expected that more research would have been done. The answers are B and C. 29-30. Answer: D. They were from all socio-economic groups, E. They were interviewed face-to-face Here’s what the speakers say: JACK: The participants in the survey were quite positive about the traffic-light system. ALICE: Mmm. But I don’t think they targeted the right people. They should have focused on people with low literacy levels because these labels are designed to be accessible to them. JACK: Yeah, but it’s good to get feedback from all socio-economic groups. And there wasn’t much variation in their responses. ALICE: No. But if they hadn’t interviewed participants face-to-face, they could have used a much bigger sample size. I wonder why they chose that method? JACK: Dunno. How were they selected? Did they volunteer or were they approached? ALICE: I think they volunteered. The thing that wasn’t stated was how often they bought packaged food – all we know is how frequently they used the supermarket. Explanation: The survey did not target people with low literacy levels, although Alice thinks this would have been a good idea. Therefore, A is incorrect. Alice also says that in the survey people did not state how often they consumed packaged food, so B is also incorrect. The participants were not selected – on the contrary, they volunteered, so C is incorrect. Jack says that the survey obtained answers from all socio-economic groups, therefore D is true. In addition, Alice tells Jack that the participants were interviewed face-to-face, which meant that the sample size of the survey was small. Thus, E is also true. The answers are D and E. SECTION 4 31. Answer: destruction Here’s what the speaker says: – …and in 1623 the ruler of Constantinople demanded the destruction of all coffee houses in the city… Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (destruction): ordered = demanded Explanation: the speaker says that the ruler of Constantinople demanded that all the coffee houses in the city must be destroyed. The answer is destruction. 32. Answer: universities/university Here’s what the speaker says: In the seventeenth century, coffee drinking spread to Europe, and here too coffee shops became places where ordinary people, nearly always men, could meet to exchange ideas. Because of this, some people said that these places performed a similar function to universities. Explanation: Coffee shops were places where men often met and exchanged ideas – and in this way they were similar to universities. So, some people made this comparison. The answer is universities/university. 33. Answer: political Here’s what the speaker says: The opportunity they provided for people to meet together outside their own homes and to discuss the topics of the day had an enormous impact on social life, and many social movements and political developments had their origins in coffee house discussions. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (political): played an important part in = had an enormous impact on changes = developments Explanation: the speaker says that the coffee shops had an important role to play in many social movements and political developments which first started from discussions within the coffee shops. The answer is political. 34. Answer: port(s) Here’s what the speaker says: Different types of coffee were produced in different areas and it’s interesting that the names given to these different types like Mocha or Java coffee were often taken from the port they were shipped to Europe from. Explanation: the speaker says that the names of different types of coffee were adopted from ‘the port they were shipped to Europe”. To put it simply, they were named according to the ports they came from. The answer is port(s). 35. Answer: slaves/slavery Here’s what the speaker says: In Brazil and the various Caribbean colonies, coffee was grown in huge plantations and the workers there were almost all slaves. Explanation: in these places coffee was cultivated (“grown”) on large plantations, and this work was done by slaves. This system was slavery. The answer is slaves/slavery. 36. Answer: taxation Here’s what the speaker says: …in Java, which had been colonized by the Dutch, the peasants grew coffee and passed a proportion of this on to the Dutch, so it was used a means of taxation. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (taxation): form = means Explanation: the speaker says that peasants in the Dutch colony of Java passed a percentage of the coffee that they grew to the Dutch in order to pay their taxes. The answer is taxation. 37. Answer: sugar Here’s what the speaker says: Coffee was grown in ever-increasing quantities to satisfy the growing demand from Europe, and it became nearly as important as sugar production. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (sugar): almost = nearly Explanation: as demand for coffee grew in Europe, its production became almost as important as the production of sugar The answer is sugar. 38. Answer: tea Here’s what the speaker says: In Britain, however, a new drink was introduced from China, and started to become popular, gradually taking over from coffee, although at first it was so expensive that only the upper class could afford it. This was tea, and by the late 1700s it was being widely drunk. However, when the USA gained independence from Britain in 1776, they identified this drink with Britain, and coffee remained the preferred drink in the USA, as it still is today. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (tea): the move towards = taking over from Explanation: the speaker mentions the move towards the consumption of tea in the late 1700s.Because tea was “widely drunk” in Britain, the independent Americans “identified this drink with Britain”, so it was not the favourite drink in the USA. We can say the shift to tea consumption did not also take place in the USA. The answer is tea. 39. Answer: transportation Here’s what the speaker says: So, by the early nineteenth century, coffee was already being widely produced and consumed. But during this century, production boomed and coffee prices started to fall. This was partly because new types of transportation had been developed which were cheaper and more efficient. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (transportation): prices dropped = prices started to fall improvements = more efficient Explanation: according to the speaker, the coffee prices dropped as a result of improvements in transportation (“this was partly because new types of transportation had been developed which were cheaper and more efficient”). The answer is transportation 40. Answer: night Here’s what the speaker says: So now, working people could afford to buy coffee – it wasn’t just a drink for the middle classes. And this was at a time when large parts of Europe were starting to work in industries. And sometimes this meant their work didn’t stop when it got dark; they might have to continue throughout the night. So, the use of coffee as a stimulant became important – it wasn’t just a drink people drank in the morning, for breakfast. Explanation: the speaker says that because coffee was cheaper, people working in industry could afford to buy it. Because it was a stimulant, it helped industrial workers to work at night. The answer is night.",

You may get confused by the two numbers but £850 is the average amount of money people pay (“what people typically pay”) for accommodation. The answer is 850. 2. Answer: bike/bicycle Here’s what the speaker says: LINDA: Well, I’m very lucky. I work in the city centre so I don’t have to use public transport. I go by bike. The woman says that she goes to work by bike, and she does not use public transport. The answer is bike/bicycle. 3. Answer: parking Here’s what the speaker says: LINDA: Anyway, driving to work in the city centre would be a nightmare because there’s hardly any parking. And the traffic during the rush hour can be bad. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (parking): limited = hardly any. The woman says that in the city centre there is “hardly any” (limited) parking. The answer is parking. 4. Answer: 30/thirty Here’s what the speaker says: LINDA: Getting to London is no problem. There’s a fast train every 30minutes which only takes 45 minutes. Explanation: There are two numbers mentioned. 30 minutes is the train frequency, while 45 minutes is the length of the journey. In this question, we need to fill in the information of the train frequency, not how long the journey takes. The answer is 30/thirty. 5. Answer: weekend/weekends Here’s what the speaker says: LINDA: Yeah, the train service isn’t bad during the week. And they run quite late at night. It’s weekends that are a problem. There’s always engineering work and you have to take a bus to Hadham and pick up the train there, which is really slow… Explanation: The woman explains that the train service is OK during the week and at night. However, at weekends there are problems. The service is poor because of engineering work. The answer is weekend/weekends 6. Answer: cinema Here’s what the speaker says: LINDA: There are some nice restaurants in the city center and a brand new cinema, which has only been open a couple of months. There’s a good arts center too. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (cinema): New = brand new Explanation: Talking about the advantages of living in Branford, the woman mentions the nice restaurants and the arts center, and also the new cinema, which “opened recently (“which has only been open a couple of months”). The answer is cinema. 7. Answer: hospital Here’s what the speaker says: LINDA: We’re really lucky. There are lots of really good aspects to living here. The schools are good and the hospital here is one of the best in the country. Everyone I know who’s been there’s had a positive experience. Explanation: Another advantage of living in Branford is the hospital (“one of the best in the country”). She says that everyone has a positive opinion of going there, which means that it has an excellent reputation. The answer is hospital. 8. Answer: dentist Here’s what the speaker says: LINDA: …Oh, I can give you the name of my dentist too in Bridge Street, if you’re interested. I’ve been going to him for years and I’ve never had any problems. Explanation: Linda recommends her dentist in Bridge Street to Matt. She thinks that the dentist is good, because she has gone to him “for years and I’ve never had any problems”. The answer is dentist. 9. Answer: Thursday Here’s what the speakers say: LINDA: I could meet you if you like and show you around. MATT: Are you sure? We’d really appreciate that. LINDA: Either a Tuesday or Thursday is good for me, after 5.30 pm. MATT: Thursday’s preferable – Tuesday I need to get home before 6 pm. LINDA: OK. Great… Explanation: Linda can meet Matt on Tuesday, or Thursday after 5.30 pm, but Matt says “Tuesday I need to get home before 6 pm”. They therefore agree to meet on Thursday. The answer is Thursday. 10. Answer: café Here’s what the speaker says: LINDA: OK. Great! Let me know which train you’re catching and I’ll meet you in the café outside. You can’t miss it. It’s opposite the station and next to the museum. Explanation: Linda arranges to meet Matt in the café opposite the station. The answer is café. SECTION 2 11. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: – “The first question to ask yourself is whether you would enjoy training in a gym. Many people are put off by the idea of having to fit a visit to the gym into their busy day… But with regular training, you’ll see a big difference in a relatively short space of time.” Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (F): Using a gym = training in a gym Fast results = a big difference in a relatively short space of time Explanation: The speaker says that, although gyms can get very crowded, if you go regularly, you will see a big difference to your fitness in a short time – in other words, you will achieve fast results. The answer is F. 12. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: – “Running has become incredibly popular in recent years. That’s probably got a lot to do with the fact that it’s a very accessible form of exercise. Anyone can run even if you only run a few meters to begin with…” Explanation: The speaker says that “anyone can run even if you only run a few meters to begin with”, indicating that fitness level is not important when it comes to running. This is the reason why she describes running as a “very accessible form of exercise”. The answer is D. 13. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: – “Swimming is another really good way to build fitness. What attracts many people is that you can swim in an indoor pool at any time of year.” Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): not dependent on season = at any time of year Explanation: The speaker says that one big advantage of swimming is that you can go to an indoor pool at any time of year, which means that you don’t have to depend on seasonal good weather. The answer is A. 14. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: – “Cycling has become almost as popular as running in recent years. That’s probably because as well as improving their fitness, many people say being out in the fresh air in the park or in the countryside can be fun.” Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): enjoyable = fun Explanation: The speaker says that one reason for the popularity of cycling is the enjoyment and fun of “being out in the fresh air”, in the park or countryside. The answer is B 15. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: – “Yoga is a good choice for those of you looking for exercise which focuses on developing both a healthy mind and body. It’s a good way of building strength and,with the right instructor, there’s less chance of hurting yourself than with other more active sports.” Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): low risk of injury = less chance of hurting yourself Explanation: The speaker says that, although yoga is challenging,with a good instructor you’re not very likely to be injured compared with other more active sports. The answer is C 16. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: – “Getting a personal trainer is a good way to start your fitness program. Obviously there can be significant costs involved. But if you’ve got someone there to encourage you and help you achieve your goals, you’re less likely to give up.” Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (G): motivating = encourage Explanation: The speaker says training with a personal trainer can be encouraging and will “help you achieve your goals”. So, the advantage of getting a personal trainer is that it can be motivating. The answer is G. 17-18. Answer: B. loss of confidence, C. too much effort required Here’s what the speaker says: – I don’t think people certainly stop caring about improving their fitness or decide they have more important things to do. I think people lose interest when they don’t think they’re making enough progress. That’s when they give up hope and stop believing they’ll ever achieve their goals. Also, what people sometimes don’t realize when they start is that it takes a lot of determination and hard work to keep training week after week, and lots of people don’t have that kind of commitment. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (B, C): loss of confidence = stop believing too much effort = a lot of determination and hard work Explanation: The speaker says she doesn’t think that people “stop caring about improving their fitness or decide they have more important things to do”, so choice A. lack of time is incorrect. High cost is not cited as a reason for giving up, so choice D is wrong. There is no information about how successful they are compared with others; hence E is incorrect as well. According to the speaker, people give up because they don’t see much progress and stop believing they’ll achieve their goals, in other words, they lose their confidence in their health goals, so B is correct. The other reason mentioned is the significant amount of effort required to reach fitness goals. The speaker thinks many people simply aren’t determined or work hard enough to see the results, and consequently they quit going to the gym. So C is correct. The correct answers are B and C. 19-20. Answer: B. have achievable aims, D. give yourself rewards Here’s what the speaker says: – One thing you can do to help yourself is to set manageable goals. Be realistic and don’t push yourself too far. Some people advise writing goals down but I think it’s better to have a flexible approach. Give yourself a really nice treat every time you reach one of your goals. And don’t get too upset if you experience setbacks. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (B, D): achievable = manageable aims = goals rewards = a really nice treat Explanation: The speaker does not think you should write down your goals or that “you should push yourself too far” (challenge yourself), so A and E are incorrect. She does not mention setting a time limit, so C is also incorrect. The speaker advises people to “set manageable goals” or “achievable aims” and “give yourself a really nice treat every time you reach one of your goals”. So B and D are correct answers. SECTION 3 21. Answer: C. carpets he saw on holiday Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: Why did you choose that topic? JIM: Well, I got a lot of useful ideas from the museum, you know, at that exhibition of textiles. But I’ve always been interested in anything to do with colour. Years ago, I went to a carpet shop with my parents when we were on holiday in Turkey, and I remember all the amazing colours. TUTOR: They might not all have been natural dyes. JIM: Maybe not, but for the project I decided to follow it up. And I found a great book about a botanic garden in California that specializes in plants used for dyes. Explanation: Although Jim talks about the textile exhibition at the museum and the book about a botanic garden, the question is about what first inspired him to choose the project. This was something which he saw “years ago” on holiday with his parents in a carpet shop. Therefore, the answer is C. 22. Answer: A. using a range of dyes with different fibres Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: OK. So, in your project, you had to include a practical investigation. JIM: Yeah. At first I couldn’t decide on my variables. I was going to just look at one type of fibre for example, like cotton… TUTOR: …and see how different types of dyes affected it? JIM: Yeah. Then I decided to include others as well, so I looked at cotton and wool and nylon. TUTOR: With just one type of dye? JIM: Various types, including some that weren’t natural for comparison. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): a range of = various types Explanation: At first, Jim planned to test one type of fibre (eg. cotton) with a range of dyes (choice B). Then he decided to test different types of fibres (cotton, wool and nylon), using a range of dyes (choice A). The answer is A. 24. Answer: A. how much natural material was needed to make the dye Here’s what the speakers say: JIM: So, I did the experiments last week. I used some ready-made natural dyes, I found a website which supplied them, they came in just a few days, but I also made some of my own. TUTOR: That must have taken quite a bit of time. JIM: Yes, I’d thought it’d be just a matter of teaspoon or so of dye, and actually that wasn’t the case at all. Like I was using one vegetable, beetroot, for a red dye, and I had to chop up a whole pile of it. So it all took longer than I’d expected. Explanation: Although he used some dyes he found on an internet website, this was not the reason why Jim was surprised. When he made some of his own dyes, he was surprised how much natural material (eg. beetroot) he needed to make the dye – he had to prepare a lot (a whole pile) of it. Therefore, the answer is A. 25. Answer: C Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: So what natural dyes did you look at? JIM: Well, one was turmeric. The colour’s great, it’s a really strong yellow. It’s generally used in dishes like curry. TUTOR: It’s meant to be quite good for your health when eaten, but you might find it’s not permanent when it’s used as a dye – a few washes, and it’s gone. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): not long-lasting = not permanent Explanation: The tutor says that turmeric is not a long-lasting dye (“not permanent”, “a few washes, and it’s gone”). The answer is, therefore, C. 26. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: JIM: Right. I used beetroot as a dye for wool. When I chop up beetroot to eat, I always end up with bright red hands, but the wool ended up just a sort of watery cream shade. Disappointing. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (F): unexpected = disappointing colour = shade Explanation: Jim says although, when cooking, beetroot has a strong colour (“I always end up with bright red hands”), it is not a good dye since it just produces a “watery cream shade” when applied to wool. So, the colour when used as a dye is unexpected – and disappointing. The answer is F. 27. Answer: H Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: There’s a natural dye called Tyrian purple. Have you heard of that? JIM: Yes. It comes from a shellfish, and it was worn in ancient times but only by important people as it was so rare. I didn’t use it. TUTOR: It fell out of use centuries ago, though one researcher managed to get hold of some recently… Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (H): not generally available = rare = fell out of use Explanation: The dye Tyrian purple is so rare that in the past only a few important people used it. This is why Jim didn’t use it. The tutor explains that it “fell out of use” (= people stopped using it) hundreds of years ago. One researcher did manage to get some recently, but it is not generally available. The answer is H. 28. Answer: D Here’s what the speakers say: JIM: Logwood. That was quite complicated. I had to prepare the fabric so the dye would take. TUTOR: I hope you were careful to wear gloves. JIM: Yes. I know the danger with that dye. TUTOR: Good. It can be extremely dangerous if it’s ingested. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (D): very poisonous = extremely dangerous if it’s ingested Explanation: The tutor says logwood should be treated with care when used as a dye because it is poisonous (“extremely dangerous if it’s ingested”). If you ingest something, you take it into your body – usually by swallowing it, but also possibly through your skin. So, Jim used gloves to handle the logwood. The answer is D. 29. Answer: A Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: …Now, presumably, you had a look at an insect-based dye? Like cochineal, for example? JIM: Yes. I didn’t actually make that. I didn’t have time to start crushing up insects to get the red colour and anyway they’re not available here, but I managed to get the dye quite easily from a website. But it cost a fortune. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): expensive = cost a fortune Explanation: Jim says cochineal “cost a fortune”, this means it is expensive. The answer is A. 30. Answer: E Here’s what the speakers say: JIM: I also read about using metal oxide. Apparently, you can allow iron to rust while it’s in contact with the fabric, and that colours it. TUTOR: Yes, that works well for dying cotton. But you have to be careful as the metal can actually affect the fabric and so you can’t expect to get a lot of wear out of fabrics treated in this way. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (E): damage the fabric = affect the fabric Explanation: The tutor advises Jim to be careful with metal oxide as “metal can actually affect the fabric”, or in other words, metal oxide can do damage to the fabric. Therefore, the answer is E. SECTION 4 31. Answer: tongue(s) Here’s what the speaker says: – Unlike European lizards, which are mostly small, green and fast-moving, sleepy lizards are brown, but what’s particularly distinctive about them is the colour of the tongue, which is dark blue, in contrast with the lining of their mouth which is bright pink. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (tongue): recognisable = particularly distinctive Explanation: The speaker says sleepy lizards are easily identifiable by their dark blue tongue. So, the answer is tongue(s). 32. Answer: plants Here’s what the speaker says: – They have quite a varied diet, including insects and even small animals, but they mostly eat plants of varying kinds. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (plants): mainly = mostly Explanation: The speaker says “they mostly eat plants of varying kinds”, this means their diet consists mainly of plants. The answer is plants. 33. Answer: snakes Here’s what the speaker says: – Even though they’re quite large and powerful, with strong jaws that can crush beetles and snail shells, they still have quite a few predators. Large birds like cassowaries were one of the main ones in the past, but nowadays they’re more likely to be caught and killed by snakes. Explanation: The speaker says that in the past, large birds were one of the main predators, but now they are more commonly killed by snakes. The answer is snakes. 34. Answer: sky Here’s what the speaker says: – … And he found that even if they were taken some distance away from their home territory, they could usually find their way back home as long as they could see the sky – they didn’t need any other landmarks on the ground. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (sky): navigate = find their way Explanation: One study showed that lizards could navigate using the sky to find their way back home. They did not need any other aids to navigation. The answer is sky. 35. Answer: partner(s) Here’s what the speaker says: – Observations of these lizards in the wild have also revealed that their mating habits are quite unusual. Unlike most animals, it seems that they’re relatively monogamous, returning to the same partner year after year. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (partner): keep the same partner = monogamous/returning to the same partner for several years = year after year Explanation: Talking about the mating habits of these lizards, the speaker says that they return to the same partner year after year (=monogamous). Therefore, the answer is partner(s) 36. Answer: contact Here’s what the speaker says: – It could be that it’s to do with protecting their young – you’d expect them to have a much better chance of survival if they have both parents around. But in fact, observers have noted that once the babies have hatched out of their eggs, they have hardly any contact with their parents. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (contact): little = hardly any children = young = babies Explanation: Observations have shown that after hatching, the young lizards “have hardly any contact with their parents”. In other words, they have little contact with them. So, the answer must be contact. 37. Answer: protection Here’s what the speaker says: – Another suggestion’s based on the observation that male lizards in monogamous relationships tend to be bigger and stronger than other males. So maybe the male lizards stay around so they can give the female lizards protection from other males. Explanation: Male lizards may stay with their female partner in order to provide protection from other males. The answer is protection. 38. Answer: tail(s) Here’s what the speaker says: – Finally, I’d like to mention another study that involved collecting data by tracking the lizards… So we caught some lizards in the wild and we developed a tiny GPS system that would allow us to track them, and we fixed this onto their tails. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (tails): attached = fixed Explanation: To carry out the tracking study, a tiny GPS system was used. After some wild lizards were caught, the system was attached to their tails. The answer is tail(s). 39. Answer: steps Here’s what the speaker says: – Then we set the lizards free again, and we were able to track them for twelve days and gather data not just about their location, but even about how many steps they took during this period. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (steps): provide information on = gather data about the number of = how many Explanation: The speaker says that not only did the tracking system show data on the lizards’ location, but it even enabled the researchers to know the number of steps the animals had taken. So, the answer must be steps. 40. Answer: injury/injuries Here’s what the speaker says: – One surprising thing we discovered from this is that there were far fewer meetings between lizards than we expected – it seems that they were actually trying to avoid one another. So why would that be? Well, again we have no clear evidence, but one hypothesis is that male lizards can cause quite serious injuries to one another, so maybe this avoidance is a way of preventing this – of self- preservation. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (injuries): reduce chances = prevent Explanation: The speaker explains that the lizards tried to avoid one another, possible because they wanted to avoid serious injuries which sometimes occur as a result of conflicts between male lizards. So the answer is injury/injuries.",
      "excerpt_clean": "SECTION 1​ 1. Answer: £850 Explanation: Be careful. The woman first mentions £850, but then she gives the upper limit for the rent – £900. You may get confused by the two numbers but £850 is the average amount of money people pay (“what people typically pay”) for accommodation. The answer is 850. 2. Answer: [ ]",

      "content_clean": "SECTION 1 1. Answer: races Here’s what the speaker says: JIM: If you’re pretty serious about cycling, there’s the Full membership. That costs 260 dollars and that covers you not just for ordinary cycling but also for races both here in the city and also in other parts of Australia. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (races): all over = in other parts of Explanation: the man says that the Full membership covers both ordinary cycling and races in all parts of Australia. The answer is races. 2. Answer: insurance Here’s what the speaker says: JIM: Now both types of membership include the club fee of 20 dollars. They also provide insurance in case you have an accident, though we hope you won’t need that, of course. Explanation: The cost of membership, therefore, includes the club fee plus insurance. The answer is insurance. 3. Answer: Jerriz. Here’s what the speakers say: JIM: …And once you’re a member of the club, you’re also permitted to wear our kit when you’re out cycling. It’s green and white. WOMAN: Yes. I’ve seen cyclists wearing it. So, can I buy that at the club? JIM: No, it’s made to order by a company in Brisbane. You can find them online, they’re called Jerriz. That’s J-E-R-R-I-Z… Explanation: The man spells the name of the company that makes the club kit. The name includes some less common letters to test your spelling ability. The answer is Jerriz. 4. Answer: 25 Here’s what the speaker says: JIM: Sure. So we have training rides pretty well every morning, and they’re a really good way of improving your cycling skills as well as your general level of fitness, but they’re different levels. Level A is pretty fast – you’re looking at about 30 or 35 kilometres an hour. If you can do about 25 kilometres an hour, you’d probably be level B, and then the level C are the novices….. Explanation: The speed for each level is mentioned, and the speed for level B is about 25 kilometres per hour (kph). The answer is 25. 5. Answer: stadium Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: So when are the sessions for that level? JIM: There are a couple each week. They’re both early morning sessions. There’s one on Tuesdays, andfor that one you meet at 5.30 am, and the meeting point’s the stadium – do you know where that is? Explanation: For the Tuesday morning session, the man explains that the meeting point is the stadium. The answer is stadium. 6. Answer: park Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: …and how about the other one? JIM: That’s on Thursdays. It starts at the same time, but they meet at the main gate to the park. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (park): entrance = gate Explanation: For sessions taking place on Thursday mornings, club members will meet at the entrance (“the main gate”) to the park. The answer is park. 7. Answer: coffee Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: So how long are the rides? JIM: They’re about an hour and a half. So, if you have a job it’s easy to fit in before you go to work. And the members often go somewhere for coffee afterwards, so it’s quite a social event. Explanation: We need to listen for an activity that club members often do together. The man says that they often have coffee together after the session. The answer is coffee. 8. Answer: leader Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: And does each ride have a leader? JIM: Sometimes, but not always. But you don’t really need one; the group members on the ride support one another, anyway. Explanation: The man replies that there is sometimes a leader with the group, but not always, because the group do not really need a leader. The answer is leader. 9. Answer: route Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: How would we know where to go? JIM: If you check the club website, you’ll see that the route for each ride is clearly marked. So you can just print that out and take it along with you. Explanation: The man says that you can check and print out the route from the club website, so The answer is route. 10. Answer: lights Here’s what the speaker says: JIM: And in winter, it’s well before sunrise when we set out, so you need to make sure your bike’s got lights. Explanation: Because they begin cycling in winter when it is still dark, you must have lights on your bike. The answer is lights. SECTION 2 11. Answer: C. 8 hours per year Here’s what the speaker says: Participating doesn’t necessarily involve a huge time commitment. The company will pay for eight hours of your time. That can be used over one or two days all at once, or spread over several months throughout the year. There are some staff who enjoy volunteering so much they also give up their own free time for a couple of hours every week. Explanation: The speaker talks about the volunteering projects in which the company is involved. The speaker says “the company will pay for eight hours of your time”, meaning it allows 8 paid hours of volunteering per employee. The permitted hours can be spread “throughout the year”, so each person will get 8 hours per year. The reference to some staff who enjoy volunteering and do this “for a couple of hours every week” is irrelevant, because the question is about the time allowed by the company for volunteering. Therefore, The answer is C. 12. Answer: B. job satisfaction Here’s what the speaker says: Feedback from staff has been overwhelmingly positive. Because they felt they were doing something really useful, nearly everyone agreed that volunteering made them feel more motivated at work. They also liked building relationships with the people in the local community and felt valued by them. One or two people also said it was good thing to have on their CVs. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): almost all employees = nearly everyone Explanation: The speaker said almost all employees “felt they were doing something really useful” and “volunteering made them feel more motivated at work”. This means they feel satisfied with the job. The answer is B. 13. Answer: C. communication skills Here’s what the speaker says: One particularly successful project last year was the Get Working Project. This was aimed at helping unemployed people in the area get back to work. Our staff were able to help them improve their telephone skills, such as writing down messages and speaking with confidence to potential customers, which they had found quite difficult. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): communication skills = telephone skills Explanation: The speaker said last year some staff helped unemployed people with their communication skills (“telephone skills, such as writing down messages and speaking with confidence to potential customers”). All of these are different types of skills for communicating with other people. Therefore, The answer is C. 14. Answer: B. park Here’s what the speaker says: We’ve got an exciting new project starting this year. Up until now, we’ve mainly focused on projects to do with education and training. And we’ll continue with our reading project in schools and our work with local charities. But we’ve also agreed to help out on a conservation project in Redfern Park. Explanation: The speaker mentions some volunteering projects like the reading project in schools, the work with local charities and the conservation project in Redfern Park. Of these three projects, the reading and the charity ones are not new since they’re the company’s main focus and continued by the staff. The conservation project in the park, on the other hand, is a new one, starting from this year. Therefore, The answer is B. 15. Answer: B. at a college Here’s what the speaker says: I also want to mention the annual Digital Inclusion Day, which is coming up next month. The aim of this is to help older people keep up with technology. And this year, instead of hosting the event in our own training facility, we’re using the ICT suite at Hill College, as it can hold far more people. We’ve invited over 60 people from the Silver Age Community Centre to take part, so we’ll need a lot of volunteers to help with this event. Explanation: The speaker says that this year, the Digital Inclusion Day will be held in the ICT suite at Hill College, not at the company’s training facility. Older people from a community centre have been invited, but the training will not take place at a community centre. Therefore, The answer is B. 16. Answer: A. fill in a form Here’s what the speaker says: If you’re interested in taking part, please go to the volunteering section of our website and complete the relevant form. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): fill in a form = complete the relevant form Explanation: The speaker says that no training will be provided and that, after they have completed the form, volunteers should tell their manager. The key point is that staff should fill in the form on the website. The answer is A. 17-18. Answer: C. Their phones were mostly old-fashioned; E. They initially showed little interest Here’s what the speaker says: The participants on the Digital Inclusion Day really benefited. The majority were in their seventies, though some were younger and a few were even in their nineties. Quite a few owned both a computer and a mobile phone, but these tended to be outdated models. They generally knew how to do simple things, like send texts, but weren’t aware of recent developments in mobile phone technology. A few were keen to learn but most were quite dismissive at first – they couldn’t see the point of updating their skills. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (C and E): old-fashioned = outdated showed little interest = quite dismissive Explanation: The speaker says the majority of the participants, not all of them were in their seventies, so A is incorrect; “quite a few owned both a computer and a mobile phone”, and “generally knew how to do simple things, like send texts”, so D is wrong as well. B is irrelevant since the speaker just says that those who attended owned computers, but he does not mention whether they used their computer or not. The speaker says that the participants used “outdated models”, so C is correct. It is also stated that “most were quite dismissive at first”, meaning they showed little interest in the Digital Inclusion Day, so E is correct, too. The answers are C, E. 19-20. Answer: B. communicating with family, D. playing online games Here’s what the speaker says: The feedback was positive. The really encouraging thing was that participants all said they felt much more confident about using social media to keep in touch with their grandchildren, who prefer this form of communication to phoning or sending emails. A lot of them also said playing online games would help them make new friends and keep their brains active. They weren’t that impressed with being able to order their groceries online, as they liked going out to the shops,…One thing they asked about was using the tablets for things like reading newspapers – some people had been given tablets as presents but had never used them. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (B and D): communicating = keep in touch family = grandchildren Explanation: A is incorrect because although people asked about tablets for reading newspapers, some had never used them. C is incorrect because people often preferred to go out to the shops, rather than shopping online. E is also wrong because they preferred to communicate with their family using social media, not sending emails.On the Digital Inclusion Day, people said they now felt more confident about using social media to communicate with family members (especially grandchildren), so B is correct. D is also correct because people say that playing online games keeps their brain active. The answer are B, D. SECTION 3 21. Answer: B. his uncertainty about what he should try to achieve Here’s what the speaker says: RUSS: …And I’m really struggling. I chose the topic because I didn’t know much about it and wanted to learn more, but now I’ve read so much about it, in a way there’s too much to say – I could talk much longer than the twenty minutes I’ve been allocated. Should I assume the other students don’t know much, and give them a kind of general introduction, or should I try and make them share my fascination with a particular aspect? Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B):difficulty = struggling Explanation: His lack of knowledge about the topic is not a problem for Russ since he has “read so much about it, in a way there’s too much to say”, hence A is incorrect. C is also incorrect. He says that he has “read so much about it”, so he has clearly had time to prepare his presentation on the topic. The correct answer is B. Russ is uncertain because he cannot decide if he should give a general introduction to the topic or to focus on one interesting aspect of it. The answer is B. 22. Answer: A. to concentrate on how nanotechnology is used in one field Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: OK. Now, one way of approaching this is to work through developments in chronological order. RUSS : Uh-huh. TUTOR : On the other hand, you could talk about the numerous ways that nanotechnology is being applied. RUSS : You mean things like thin films on camera displays to make them water-repellent and additives to make motorcycle helmets stronger and lighter TUTOR : Exactly. Or another way would be to focus on its impact in one particular area, say medicine, or space exploration. RUSS : That would make it easier to focus. Perhaps I should do that. TUTOR : I think that would be a good idea. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A):concentrate on = focus one field = one particular area Explanation: Although all of the choices are mentioned, the tutor and Russ both agree on discussing the impact of nanotechnology in one field. (Russ says: “Perhaps I should do that”, and the tutor thinks it would be a good idea). Therefore, The answer is A. 23. Answer: C. consider omitting slides altogether Here’s what the speakers say: RUSS: Right. How important is it to include slides in the presentation? TUTOR: They aren’t essential, by any means. And there’s a danger of tailoring what you say to fit whatever slides you can find. While it can be good to include slides, you could end up spending too long looking for suitable ones. You might find it better to leave them out. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): omitting = leave out Explanation: The tutor advises Russ against including slides as he could “end up spending too long looking for suitable ones”, so she thinks he’d better omit them altogether (“leave them out”). The answer is C. 24. Answer: C. to provide an example Here’s what the speakers say: RUSS: Another thing I was wondering about was how to start. I know presentations often begin with “First I’m going to talk about this, and then I’ll talk about that”, but I thought about asking the audience what they know about nanotechnology. TUTOR: That would be fine if you had an hour or two for the presentation, but you might find that you can’t do anything with the answers you get, and it simply eats into the short time that’s available. RUSS: So, maybe I should mention a particular way that nanotechnology is used, to focus people’s attention. TUTOR: That sounds sensible. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C):example = a particular way Explanation: A is incorrect because the tutor tells Russ that encouraging the audience to talk is too time-consuming: “ …it simply eats into the short time that’s available”. B is also wrong, because they do not discuss the option of starting the presentation by telling the audience what Russ intends to talk about. C is correct, because the best choice to start the presentation is to provide an example (“mention a particular way that nanotechnology is used”). The answer is C. 25. Answer: A. summarise the main point he wants to make Here’s what the speakers say: RUSS: What do you think I should do next? I really have to plan the presentation today and tomorrow. TUTOR: Well, initially I think you should ignore all the notes you’ve made, take a small piece of paper, and write a single short sentence that ties together the whole presentation: it can be something as simple as “Nanotechnology is already improving our lives”. Then start planning the content around that. You can always modify that sentence later, if you need to. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A):summarise = tie together Explanation: The tutor suggests that Russ should not read the notes he’s already made (“you should ignore all the notes”). Therefore, B is incorrect. Neither of the speakers refers to the idea of listing the topics that Russ wants to cover, so C is also incorrect. Instead, he should summarise the main point of his presentation (“write a single short sentence that ties together the whole presentation”). The correct answer, therefore, is A. 26. Answer: structure Here’s what the speaker says: TUTOR: …With regard to the structure, I felt that you ended rather abruptly, without rounding it off. Be careful not to do that in next week’s presentation. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A):lacked a conclusion = without rounding it off Explanation: The tutor thinks in his previous presentation, Russ “ended rather abruptly, without rounding it off.” This means he lacked failed to conclude by bringing all the arguments of his presentation together. The correct answer is A. 27. Answer: eye contact Here’s what the speaker says: TUTOR: And you made very little eye contact with the audience, because you were looking down at your notes most of the time. You need to be looking at the audience and only occasionally glancing at your notes. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C):not enough = very little Explanation: The tutor says Russ “made very little eye contact with the audience”. In other words, she thinks he didn’t make enough eye contact with them. The answer is C. 28. Answer: body language Here’s what the speaker says: TUTOR: Your body language was a little odd. Every time you show a slide, you turned your back on the audience so you could look at it – you should have been looking at your laptop. And you kept scratching your head, so I found myself wondering when you were next going to do that, instead of listening to what you were saying! Explanation: The tutor says Russ’s body language was “a little odd”. She adds “you kept scratching your head, so I found myself wondering when you were next going to do that, instead of listening to what you were saying!” This means she was distracted by Russ’s gesture – scratching his head, and as a result she found it difficult to focus on what he was saying. The answer is D. 29. Answer: choice of words Here’s what the speakers say: RUSS: What did you think of the language? I knew that not everyone was familiar with the subject, so I tried to make it as simple as I could. TUTOR: Yes, that came across. You used a few words that are specific to the field, but you always explained what they meant, so the audience wouldn’t have any difficulty understanding. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (G):technical = specific to the field Explanation: The tutor says that Russ’s talk contained some words that were technical (“specific to the field”), but he always explained them so that the audience were able to understand. The correct answer is G. 30. Answer: handouts Here’s what the speaker says: TUTOR: I must say the handouts you prepared were well thought out. They were a good summary of your presentation, which people would be able to refer to later on. So well done on that. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B):useful = able to refer to in the future = later on Explanation: The tutor praises Russ’s handouts. They were “a good summary of his presentation, which people would be able to refer to later on.” What she means here is the handouts would be useful in the future. The answer is B. SECTION 4 31. Answer: location. Here’s what the speaker says: Episodic memories allow us to mentally travel back in time to an event from the past. Episodic memories include various details about these events, for example, when an event happened and other information such as location. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (location): recall = mentally travel back in time the time = when an event happened Explanation: Episodic memory is the ability to recall details about an event, such as the time, or the place (“location”), and the speaker gives the example of having a meal at a restaurant, and then recalling many of the details of that event. So, The answer is location. 32. Answer: world Here’s what the speaker says: Episodic memory is distinct from another type of memory called semantic memory. This is the type of factual memory that we have in common with everyone else – that is your general knowledge of the world. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (world): different = distinct information = knowledge Explanation: The speaker explains what ‘semantic memory’ means. It is the type of factual memory that everyone has – “general knowledge of the world”. The answer is world. 33. Answer: personal Here’s what the speaker says: Unlike episodic memory, semantic memory isn’t dependent on recalling personal experiences. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (personal): involve = dependent on remembering = recallinginformation = experiences Explanation: Semantic memory is referred to as having no relation to personal information (“personal experiences”). So The answer is “personal”. 34. Answer: attention. Here’s what the speaker says: The degree to which you can successfully encode information depends on the level of attention you give to an event while it’s actually happening. Explanation: The speaker talks about encoding. The more (“the degree to which”) attention that you pay to an event at the time that it happens, the more successfully you can encode it. Therefore, The answer is attention. 35. Answer: name Here’s what the speaker says: Encoding of episodic memories is also influenced by how you process an event. For example, if you were introduced to someone called Charlie, you might make the connection that your uncle has the same name. Future recollection of Charlie’s name is much easier if you have a strategy to help you encode it. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (name): remember = recollection Explanation: The speaker now talks about the next step in encoding episodic memories, using the example of remembering a name (“future recollection of Charlie’s name”) as one strategy to encode information. The answer is name. 36. Answer: network Here’s what the speaker says: Consolidation is most effective when the information being stored can be linked to an existing network of information. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (network): added = linked Explanation: The speaker now talks about the next stage in forming episodic memory – consolidation. Information is most effectively stored by adding it or linking it to a network of information that you already have, in other words “relating it” to existing information. The answer is network. 37. Answer: frequency Here’s what the speaker says: Forming strong memories depends on the frequency with which you try to retrieve them. Memories can fade or become harder to retrieve if they aren’t used very often. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (frequency): affects = depends on the strength of memories = strong memories Explanation: The speaker still talks about consolidation. If you try to retrieve memories often (“frequently”), they become easier to retrieve. Therefore, The answer is frequency. 38. Answer: colour/ color Here’s what the speaker says: Retrieving information from episodic memory depends upon semantic, olfactory, auditory and visual factors. These help episodic memory retrieval by acting as a prompt. For example, when recalling where you parked your car, you may use the colour of a sign close to where you parked. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (colour): left your car = parked near to = close to Explanation: The speaker explains the use of prompts in memory retrieval. These prompts may be of different kinds, such as remembering the colour of a sign near where you parked your car. The answer is colour/color. 39. Answer: brain Here’s what the speaker says: …the symptoms of schizophrenia can be reasonably well controlled by medication; however, patients’ episodic memory may still be impaired and so they are often unable to return to university or work. Recent studies have shown that computer-assisted games designed to keep the brain active can help improve their episodic memory. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (brain): stimulate = keep active Explanation: Schizophrenia may damage the episodic memory of sufferers. However, computer-assisted games may help to improve episodic memory by stimulating (“keeping active”) the brain. The answer is brain. 40. Answer: self Here’s what the speaker says: Episodic memories can help people connect with others, for instance by sharing intimate details about their past; something individuals with autism often have problems with. This may be caused by an absence of a sense of self. This is essential for the storage of episodic memory, and has been found to be impaired in children with autism. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (self):concept = sense forming = storage difficulty = have problems with/impaired Explanation: The speaker talks about the concept of self (“a sense of self”), which is absent in children with autism. The absence of this sense of self makes difficult (“impairs”) the formation of episodic memory in autistic children. The answer is self.",

Answer: choose Here’s what the speaker says: OFFICIAL: They focus on seasonal products, and as well as teaching you how to cook them, They also show you how to choose them. Explanation:The man gave an overview of the cookery class in The Food studio. He stated its aim clearly: teach people how to choose seasonal products besides the ways to cook them. The answer is choose. 2. Answer: private Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: Anh could I get a private lesson there? OFFICIAL: I think so… let me check, yes, They do offer those. Those in fact, most of the people who attended the classes find it’s a nice way of getting to know one another. Explanation:The woman asked if there were any private lessons in The Food Studio. This was confirmed by the official, as he said: “ They do offer those” after he had checked the relevant information. The answer is private. 3. Answer: 20, twenty percent Here’s what the speaker says: OFFICIAL: And this company has a special deal for clients where They offer a discount of 20 percent if you return for a further class. Explanation:The man states clearly that clients who come back for a further class will receive a 20 percent discount in cooking classes there. The answer is 20/twenty percent. 4. Answer: healthy Here’s what the speaker says: OFFICIAL: …Another one you might be interested in is Bond’s Cookery School. They’re quite new, They just opened six months ago, but I’ve heard good things about them. They concentrate on teaching you to prepare healthy food, and They have quite a lot of specialist staff. Explanation:The official emphasizes that clients are taught how to prepare healthy food in Bond’s Cookery School. The answer is healthy. 5. Answer: bones Here’s what the speaker says: OFFICIAL: Well, I don’t think They particularly focus on low calorie diets or weight loss. It’s more to do with recipes that look at specific needs, like including ingredients that will help build up your bones and make them stronger, that sort of thing. Explanation:The man explains about the aim of the recipes in the cooking classes. Rather than offering the clients weight loss meals, the recipes will address the body’s need like strengthening bones… The answer is bones. 6. Answer: lecture Here’s what the speaker says: OFFICIAL:…And if you want to know more about them, every Thursday evening, They have a lecture at the school. It’s free and you don’t need to book or anything, just turn up at 7.30. Explanation:The man mentions about a free lecture every Thursday evening in Bond’s Cookery School. The answer is lecture. 7. Answer: Arretsa Here’s what the speaker says: OFFICIAL: OK, there’s one more place you might be interested in. That’s got a rather strange name, it’s called The Arretsa Centre – that’s spelled A-R-R-E-T-S-A. Explanation:The official mentioned another cookery class called “The Arretsa Centre.” He then went on spelling the school name for the woman. The answer is Arretsa. 8. Answer: vegetarian Here’s what the speaker says: OFFICIAL: They’ve got a very good reputation. They do a bit of meat and fish cookery but They mostly specialize in vegetarian dishes. Explanation:The man states that the cooking centre focuses primarily on vegetarian food. The answer is vegetarian. 9. Answer: market Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: Right. That’s certainly an area I’d like to learn more about. I’ve got lots of friends who don’t eat meat. In fact, I think I might have seen that school today. Is it just by the market? OFFICIAL: That’s right. So They don’t have any problem getting their ingredients. They’re right next door. Explanation:The woman asked whether the school located near the market she saw that day was the Arretsa Centre. This was confirmed by the official when he added “ They’re right next door”, “so They don’t have any problem getting their ingredients.” The answer is market. 10. Answer: knife Here’s what the speaker says: OFFICIAL: … And They also offer a special two-hour course in how to use a knife. They cover all the different skills – buying them, sharpening, chopping techniques. It gets booked up quickly though so you’d need to check it was available. Explanation:The man specified a special training course with a knife in the cooking centre. He then listed some skills taught in the course such as buying knives, sharpening, chopping techniques. The answer is knife. SECTION 2 11. Answer: B The amount of traffic on the roads has increased Why are changes needed to traffic systems in Granford? The number of traffic accidents has risen. The amount of traffic on the roads has increased. The types of vehicles on the roads have changed. Here’s what the speaker says: Well, we’re very aware that the traffic is becoming an increasing problem. It’s been especially noticeable with the increase in heavy traffic while They’ve been building the new hospital. But it’s the overall rise in the volume of traffic of all kinds that’s concerning us. To date, there’s not been any increase in traffic accidents, but that’s not something we want to see happen, obviously. Explanation:The speaker mentions the increase in heavy traffic, meaning the types of vehicles on the roads have changed, but he doesn’t say it is an issue, so C is not correct. He also says: “To date, there’s not been any increase in traffic accidents”, so A is wrong, too. The problem concerning is the overall rise in the amount of traffic, so the answer for this question is B. 12. Answer: C inconvenience from parked cars. In a survey, local residents particularly complained about dangerous driving by parents. pollution from trucks and lorries. inconvenience from parked cars. Here’s what the speaker says: We recently carried out a survey of local residents, and their responses were interesting. People were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads due to cars parked along the sides of the roads. We’d expected complaints about the congestion near the school when parents are dropping off their children or picking them up, but this wasn’t top of the list, and nor were the noise and fumes from trucks and lorries, though They were mentioned by some people. Explanation:A is irrelevant as the speaker only speaks of congestion caused by parents and makes no reference to “dangerous driving”. “Pollution from trucks and lorries” is not a main problem either since few people have mentioned about it, so B is incorrect. The correct answer is C for “people were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads due to cars parked along the sides of the roads.” 13. Answer: B finding a way to make people follow them According to the speaker, one problem with the new regulations will be raising money to pay for them. finding a way to make people follow them. getting the support of the police. Here’s what the speaker says: We think these new traffic regulations would make a lot of difference… We’ve managed to keep our proposals within the budget, just, so They can be covered by the Council. But of course, it’s no good introducing new regulations if we don’t have a way of making sure that everyone obeys them, and that’s an area we’re still working on with the help of representatives from the police force. Explanation:The speaker says new regulations can be covered by the Council, so They don’t have to raise money to pay for the new rules. Hence, A is false. B is correct since “it’s no good introducing new regulations if we don’t have a way of making sure that everyone obeys them.” And They can find a way to make people follow them with the support of the police: “that’s an area we’re still working on with the help of representatives from the police force”, so C is incorrect. The correct answer, therefore, must be B. 14. Answer: E New traffic lights Here’s what the speaker says: Now, we already have a set of traffic lights in the High Street at the junction with Station Road, but we’re planning to have another set at the other end, at the School Road junction, to regulate the flow of traffic along the High Street. Explanation:starting from the High Street, follow the instructions, moving towards the School Road junction, we reach site E, where the new set of traffic lights will be positioned. The answer is E. 15. Answer: D Pedestrian crossing Here’s what the speaker says: We considered putting this on School Road, just outside the school, but in the end we decided that could lead to a lot of traffic congestion so we decided to locate it on the High Street, crossing the road in front of the supermarket. Explanation:Crossing the High Street until we reach the supermarket, we can find site D, where the pedestrian crossing will be put. The answer is D. 16. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: At present, parking isn’t allowed on the High Street outside the library, but we’re going to change that and allow parking there, but not at the other end of the High Street near School Road. Explanation:Now that parking will be allowed on the High Street, outside the library, it must be located in site B. The answer is B. 17. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: There’ll be a new ‘No Parking’ sign on School Road, just by the entrance to the school,… Explanation:Site G is located just by the entrance to the school, so it must be where the new ‘No Parking’ sign will lie. The answer is G. 18. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: As far as disabled drivers are concerned, at present They have parking outside the supermarket, but lorries also use those spaces, so we’ve got two new disabled parking spaces on the other side road up towards the bank. Explanation:Locating the bank on the map, we can find site C next to it. So, C is where the two new disabled parking spaces will be situated. The answer is C. 19. Answer: H Here’s what the speaker says: We also plan to widen the pavement on School Road. We think we can manage to get an extra half-metre on the bend just before you get to the school, on the same side of the road. Explanation:The bend just before you get to the school is marked with letter H. So, site H must be the widened pavement. The answer is H. 20. Answer: I Here’s what the speaker says: Finally, we’ve introduced new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket, so lorries will only be allowed to stop there before 8 a.m. That’s the supermarket on School Road – we kept to the existing arrangements with the High Street supermarket. Explanation:The supermarket on School Road is marked with letter I. Therefore, the new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket will be applied at site I while the old ones are applied to the High Street supermarket. The answer is I. SECTION 3 21. Answer: A He may do a module on a related topic later on. Why is Jack interested in investigating seed germination? He may do a module on a related topic later on. He wants to have a career in plant science. He is thinking of choosing this topic for his dissertation. Here’s what the speaker says: JACK: Yeah, but practically everything we do is going to feed into that. No, there’s an optional module on seed structure and function in the third year that I might do, so I thought it might be useful for that. If I choose that option, I don’t have to do a dissertation module. Explanation:Jack says the assignment may be useful for the moduleon seed structure and function that he might do in the third year. The correct answer is A. 22. Answer: C completed in the time available. Jack and Emma agree the main advantage of their present experiment is that it can be described very easily. carried out inside the laboratory. completed in the time available. Here’s what the speakers says: EMMA: OK. We’d need to allow time for the seeds to come up. JACK: That should be fine if we start now. A lot of the other possible experiments need quite a bit longer. EMMA: So that’d make it a good one to choose. And I don’t suppose it’d need much equipment; we’re not doing chemical analysis or anything. Though that’s not really an issue, we’ve got plenty of equipment in the laboratory. Explanation:The question asks about the main advantage of the project. According to the recording, we know that the experiment won’t need as much time as the others, meaning its plus point lies in its time. So The answer is C. 23. Answer: B whether anyone else has chosen this topic. What do They decide to check with their tutor? whether their aim is appropriate whether anyone else has chosen this topic whether the assignment contributes to their final grade Here’s what the speaker says: JACK: Yeah. We need to have a word with the tutor if we’re going to go ahead with it though. I’m sure our aim’s OK. It’s not very ambitious but the assignment’s only ten percent of our final mark, isn’t it? But we need to be sure we’re the only ones doing it. Explanation:Jack says their aim’s OK so A is incorrect. He already knows the assignment accounts for ten percent of their final mark so C is wrong, too. The only thing that They need to check with their tutor is whether anyone else has chosen this topic, “we need to be sure we’re the only ones doing it”. Hence, The correct answer is B. 24. Answer: C its focus is very theoretical. They agree that Graves’ book on seed germination is disappointing because it fails to cover recent advances in seed science. the content is irrelevant for them. its focus is very theoretical. Here’s what the speaker says: EMMA:The one by Graves? I looked through it for my last experiment, though it wasn’t all that relevant there. It would be for this experiment, though. I found it quite hard to follow – lots about the theory, which I hadn’t expected. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (C): theoretical = lots about the theory Explanation:Emma says the book is hard to follow because it contains lots of theory. This means its focus is very theoretical. So, The correct answer is C. 25. Answer: B The analysis of seed germination statistics is thorough What does Jack say about the article on seed germination by Lee Hall? The diagrams of plant development are useful. The analysis of seed germination statistics is thorough. The findings on seed germination after fires are surprising. Here’s what the speakers say: JACK: I read an article about seed germination by Lee Hall. EMMA: About seeds that lie in the ground for ages and only germinate after a fire? JACK: That’s the one. I knew a bit about it already, but not about this research. His analysis of figures comparing the times of the fires and the proportion of seeds that germinated was done in a lot of detail – very impressive. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (B): thorough = done in a lot of detail Explanation:There is no mention of the diagrams of plant development in the recording, hence, A is incorrect. Be careful with the choice C as you mighe be misled by the words. Although the book focuses on seed germination after fires, there is no information about the findings of seeds after fires and whether the results are suprising or not. So, C is incorrect, too. However, Jack is impressed by the in-depth analysis in the book. Therefore, The correct answer is B. How to Change my Photo from Admin Dashboard? Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast 26. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: JACK: Right. So the first thing we have to do is find our seeds…And obviously They mustn’t all be the same size. So, how many sorts do we need? About four different ones? Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (G): types = sorts Explanation: Jack says They should select seeds from four different types (“sorts”) and sizes. The answer is G- types. 27. Answer: C Measure and record the … and size of each one. Here’s what the speaker says: JACK: Then, for each seed we need to find out how much it weighs, and also measure its dimensions, and we need to keep a careful record of all that. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (C): weight = how much it weighs Explanation:Jack says They need to record the weight (“find out how much it weighs”) and size of every seed. The answer is C- weight. 28. Answer: H Here’s what the speaker says: EMMA: That’ll be quite time-consuming. And we also need to decide how deep we’re going to plant the seeds – right on the surface, a few millimetres down, or several centimetres. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (H): depths = how deep Explanation:Emma says They need to determine the depths (“how deep”) They will plant the seeds. The answer is H- depths. 29. Answer: A Here’s what the speakers say: JACK: OK. So then we get planting. Do you think we can plant several seeds together in the same plant pot? EMMA: No, I think we need a different one for each seed. JACK: Right. And we’ll need to label them – we can use different coloured labels… Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (A): container = plant pot Explanation:Emma thinks They should use different containers (“plant pots”) for each seed. The answer is A- containers. 30. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: JACK: … Then we wait for the seeds to germinate – I reckon that’ll be about three weeks, depending on what the weather’s like. Then we see if our plants have come up, and write down how tall They’ve grown. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (E): height = how tall Explanation:Jack says after about 3 weeks, They’ll record the height (“how tall”) of the plant. The answer is E- height. SECTION 4 31. Answer: crow Here’s what the speaker says: …And we used to think that only a few species could adapt to this new environment. One species which is well-known as being highly adaptable is the crow, and there’ve been various studies about how They manage to learn new skills. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (crow): adaptability = adaptable Explanation:The speaker talks about one species that is easily adaptable to the new environment, so The answer is crow. 32. Answer: cliffs Here’s what the speaker says: Another successful species is the pigeon, because They’re able to perch on ledges on the walls of city buildings, just like They once perched on cliffs by the sea. Explanation:The speaker likens ledges on the walls of city buildings to cliffs by the sea, where the pigeon usually perch on. So, The answer is cliffs. 33. Answer: speed Here’s what the speaker says: …And one thing that researchers are finding especially interesting is the speed with which They’re doing this – we’re not talking about gradual evolution here – these animals are changing fast. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (speed): unusual speed = changing fast Explanation:The speaker highlights the high speed with which animals are changing to adapt to urban environments. Hence, The answer is speed. 34. Answer: brain(s) Here’s what the speaker says: …And she found that during that time, these small mammals had experienced a jump in brain size when compared to rural mammals. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (brain(s)): a jump = increased Explanation:In the recording, Emilie Snell-Rood found an increase in the size of the animals’ brain. So, The answer is brain(s). 35. Answer: food Here’s what the speaker says: And Snell-Rood thinks that this change might reflect the cognitive demands of adjusting to city life – having to look in different places to find food, for example, and coping with a whole new set of dangers. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (food): locate = look in different places to find deal with = cope with Explanation:The speaker suggests that the change in the animals’ brain size may be due to their locating (“look in different places to find”) new sources of food. So, The answer is food. 36. Answer: behaviour(s) / behavior(s) Here’s what the speaker says: Then over in Germany at the Max Planck Institute, there’s another biologist called Catarina Miranda who’s done some experiments with blackbirds living in urban and rural areas. And she’s been looking not at their anatomy but at their behaviour. Explanation:It is stated clearly in the recording that Catarina Miranda focused on the behaviour of blackbirds living in urban and rural areas, not on their bodies. So, The answer is behaviour(s)/ behavior(s). 37. Answer: new Here’s what the speaker says: … She’s found that the urban blackbirds tend to be quite bold – They’re prepared to face up to a lot of threats that would frighten away their country counterparts. But there’s one type of situation that does seem to frighten the urban blackbirds, and that’s anything new – anything They haven’t expected before. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (new): afraid of = frighten = frighten away braver = bold Explanation:According to the tape, while the urban blackbirds are usually braver than their rural counterparts, They are afraid of “anything new – anything They haven’t expected before”. so the answer must be “new”. 38. Answer: stress Here’s what the speaker says: Jonathan Atwell, in Indianna University, is looking at how a range of animals respond to urban environment. He’s found that when They’re under stress, their endocrine systems react by reducing the amount of hormones such as corticosterone into their blood. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (stress): Lower levels of hormones = reducing the amount of hormones Explanation:The speaker talks about a situation in which animals respond by producing lower levels of hormones. From the evidence above, the situation must be “stress”. So The answer is “stress”. 39. Answer: tail(s) Here’s what the speaker says: There’s just one more study I’d like to mention which is by Sarah Partan and her team, and They’ve been looking at how squirrels communicate in an urban environment, and They’ve found that a routine part of their communication is carried out by waving their tails. Explanation:The study conducted by Sarah Partan’s team suggested that urban squirrels use their tails to communicate with one another. So The answer is “tail(s)”. 40. Answer: permanent Here’s what the speaker says: So, what are the long-term implications of this? One possibility is that we may see completely new species developing in cities. But on the other hand, it’s possible that not all of these adaptations will be permanent. Here are some key words that help you to get The correct answer (permanent): changes = adaptations Explanation:It’s clearly indicated in the speaker’s conclusion that the adaptations developed by the urban animals may not be permanent ones. so the answer for this question is “permanent”.",

Answer: Tuesday 10. Answer: talk/presentation SECTION 2 11. Answer: A. young professional people Which is the most rapidly-growing group of residents in the Sheepmarket area? Here’s what the speaker says: The nearby university has always meant the area’s popular with students, who come in to enjoy the lively nightlife, but now graduates embarking on careers in the worlds of fashion and design are buying up the new apartments recently built here to replace the small houses where the market workers used to live. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): young professional people = graduates embarking on careers employees = workers Explanation: The area is popular with university students but they come thereto enjoy the nightlife, not to live, so they are not the “residents” of Sheepmarket. Therefore B is wrong. Also, it is said that the “market workers” (the same as “local market employees”) USED TO live in Sheepmarket, indicating that is no longer the case, so C is wrong as well. The speaker says that “graduates embarking on careers”, who can be considered as “young professional people”, are buying up the apartments which means that more and more of them are moving here to live. Hence The answer is A. 12. Answer: C. arts and crafts. The speaker recommends the side streets in the Sheepmarket for their Here’s what the speaker says: The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures, jewellery and ceramics which won’t break the bank, as well as local produce like fruit and vegetables. There’s also lots of pavement cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from all over the world go by. The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets, including the city’s first department store, built in the 1880s, which is still open today. 13. Answer: B. be inspired by aspects of contemporary culture. Clothes designed by entrants for the Young Fashion competition must Here’s what the speaker says: The Sheepmarket is a centre for fashion, and there’s a policy of encouraging new young designers. The Young Fashion competition is open to local young people who are passionate about fashion. This year they’ve been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from the music and technology that’s part of their everyday life, using both natural and man-made fibres. The garments will be judged by a panel of experts and fashion designers, and the winning entries will be modelled at a special gala evening. 14. Answer: B. buy something in the shops. Car parking is free in some car parks if you Here’s what the speaker says: There are plenty of pay and display car parking spaces on the roadsides which are fine if you just want to stay for an hour or two, but if you want to spend the day there it’s better to park in one of the four underground car parks. It’s not expensive and if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores, you’ll not be charged at all. After six pm many of the car parks have a flat rate which varies but it is usually very reasonable. 15. Answer: H The Reynolds House Here’s what the speaker says: Most visitors start from Crawley Road, at the bottom of the map. The Reynolds House is one of the oldest houses in the city, and is open to the public. It’s on the north side of Crawley Road, next to the footpath that leads to the public gardens. Explanation: Although the footpath is not specifically marked on the map, it is obvious that it provides access to the public gardens The answer for The Reynolds House is H. 16. Answer: C The thumb Here’s what the speaker says: The area’s particularly interesting for its unusual sculptures. ‘The Thumb’ is just what its name suggests, but it’s about 10 metreshigh. You’ll see it on Hill Road, across the road from the Bank. Explanation: It is therefore opposite the Bank, on the other side of Hill Road. The answer is C. 17. Answer: F The Museum Here’s what the speaker says: The Museum’s got a particularly fine collection of New Zealand landscapes. It’s on the east side of the Sheepmarket, on City Road. It’s on the other side of the road from the public gardens, immediately facing the junction with Hill Road. Explanation: Only letter F is shown on City Road, opposite Hill Road. The answer is F. 18. Answer: G The Contemporary Art Gallery Here’s what the speaker says: The Contemporary Art Gallery is on a little road that leads off Station Square, not far from the public gardens. The road ends at the gallery – it doesn’t go anywhere else. Explanation: Locating Station Square, it is easy to find the road which ends at the gallery. The answer is G. 19. Answer: I The Warner Gallery Here’s what the speaker says: The Warner Gallery specialises in 19th century art. It’s on City Road, near the junction with Crawley Road, on the same side of the road as the public gardens. Explanation: On City Road, near the junction with Crawley Road, we locate letter I. The answer is I. 20. Answer: B Nucleus Here’s what the speaker says: Finally, if you’re interested in purchasing high quality artwork, the place to go is Nucleus. You need to go from Crawley Road up through Station Square and east along Hill Road until you get to a small winding road turning off. Go up there and it’s on your right – if you get to City Road you’ve gone too far. Explanation: There is only one winding (= not straight) road on the map, and it runs between Hill Road and City Road. The answer is B. SECTION 3 21. Answer: classification Introduce Giannetti’s books containing a … of adaptations Here’s what the speaker says: So I thought I’d start with Gianetti, who’s a professor of film and literature, and in one of his books he came up with a straightforward classification of film adaptations based on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels. Explanation: Gianetti’s book contains a classification of film adaptations. So, The answer is classification. 22. Answer: worst Ask class to suggest the … adaptations Here’s what the speaker says: I thought that next I’d ask the class to come up with the worst examples of Shakespeare adaptations that they’ve seen, and to say why. Explanation: She will ask the class about the worst adaptations of Shakespeare that they have seen. The answer is worst. 23. Answer: slides Prepare some … Here’s what the speaker says: KATIE: Next I want to talk about Rachel Malchow. I came across something on the internet about her work on film adaptations, and I was thinking of showing some film clips to illustrate her ideas. JOE: Will you have enough time, though? Both to prepare and during the presentation? After all, I doubt if you’ll be able to find all the clips you want. KATIE: Hmm. Perhaps you’re right. OK, well, I’d better do some slides instead, saying how various films relate to what she says. Explanation: Joe thinks that Katie won’t have enough time to show film clips, so Katie decides to prepare some slides instead. The answer is slides. 24. Answer: issues Discuss relationship between adaptations and … at the time of making the film Here’s what the speaker says: KATIE: Next, I want to say something about how plays may be chosen for adaptation because they’re concerned with issues of the time when the film is made. You mean things like JOE: patriotism, or the role of governments? Explanation: Joe suggests two examples of Katie’s idea – how film adaptations deal with issues of the time. The answer is issues. 25. Answer: F Ran Here’s what the speaker says: KATIE: Do you know the Japanese film Ran? JOE: I haven’t seen it. It was based on Shakespeare’s King Lear, wasn’t it?. So It was a very loose adaptation, using the same situation and story, but moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain That’s right. KATIE:for example the king’s daughters become sons, because in Japanese culture at that time, women couldn’t succeed to the throne. Explanation: The speaker mentions the time periods of the original King Lear and of the adaptation Ran, so The answer may be A, E or F because these are related to ‘period’. Be careful with the word “clearly” in A since the film only illustrates part of the historical period, not entirely, so A is incorrect. E is obviously wrong because both Ran and King Lear were set in 16th century, although the location changes from Britain to Japan, the period is the same. Therefore the correct answer must be F. 26. Answer: A Much Ado About Nothing Here’s what the speaker says: JOE: OK. I hope you’re going to talk about the 1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing. I think that’s one of the best Shakespeare films. It really brings the play to life, doesn’t it? KATIE: Yes, I agree. And I think filming it in Italy, where the play is set, makes you see what life was like at the time of the play. Explanation: The film Much Ado About Nothing is said to “bring the play to life” as it was filmed in the same place as the original play. By that, the speaker means that you can see the life of people in Italy at that time, so you know more about that “historical period”. The answer is A. 27. Answer: E Romeo Juliet Here’s what the speaker says: KATIE: Er, next. I thought Romeo Juliet,the 1996 film, which moves the action into the present day, Explanation: The play Romeo Juliet was written a long time ago, but the film “moves the action into the present day”, meaning that the period is different from the original. Therefore The answer is E. 28. Answer: C Hamlet Here’s what the speaker says: KATIE: Yes, but I’ve picked the 1996 film of Hamlet. It included every line of the text, but it’s more like a typical action hero movie – there are loads of special effects, but no unifying interpretation of the play. Explanation: The film “included every line of the text” so it CANNOT contain only some parts of the play, so B is wrong. Be careful not to confuse “loads of” with “variety” because the film includes many “special effects”, not many art forms like in answer G. The film is said to be similar to “a typical action hero movie”, which is “another kind of film”. So the correct answer is C. 29. Answer: G Prospero’s Books Here’s what the speaker says: KATIE: Exactly. Then there’s Prospero’s Books, based on The Tempest. That was really innovative, from a stylistic point of view. JOE: Didn’t it include dance and singing and animation, as well as live actors? KATIE: Yes, it did. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (G): incorporate = include Explanation: The film “includes” (the same as “incorporates”) dance, singing, animation and live actors, all of which are forms of art. The answer must be G. 30. Answer: B Looking for Richard Here’s what the speaker says: KATIE: I also want to mention Looking for Richard. Did you ever see it? JOE: No, but I’ve read about it. It was a blend of a documentary with a few scenes from Richard III, wasn’t it? KATIE: That’s right. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): parts = scenes Explanation: Richard III is the original play. The film takes a few scenes from it, so it can be understood that the film “contains parts of the original”. The answer is B. SECTION 4 31. Answer: garden/gardens Do not show other sources of noise, e.g. when windows are open or people’s neighbours are in their … Here’s what the speaker says: But there’s quite a lot going on that these maps don’t show,because they can’t capture the complex way that sound varies over time. So they ignore important issues such as the noise someone might hear from the open windows or gardens of their neighbours. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (garden/gardens): do not show = ignore Explanation: Noise maps don’t show everything. For example, they do not show (they ignore) such things as noise from neighbours when their windows are open, or noise when neighbours are in their gardens. The answer is gardens. 32. Answer: political Have made people realize that the noise is a … issue that must be dealt with Here’s what the speaker says: But anyway, even though these noise maps are fairly crude, they’ve been useful in providing information and raising awareness that noise matters, we need to deal with it and so it’s a political matter. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (political): made people realize = raising awareness matter = issue Explanation: The speaker says that noise maps have been useful (1) for providing information and (2) for making people realize that noise is an important issue (= it matters). Dealing with this issue is a political matter. The answer is political. 33. Answer: work/study Effect on the … of schoolchildren Here’s what the speaker says: It’s also known that noise can lead to a rise in levels of stress, due to physical changes in the body affecting the composition of the blood. And there are other problems as well, for instance if schoolchildren don’t have a quiet place to study, their work will suffer. Explanation: the speaker talks about the effects of noise on schoolchildren. If schoolchildren do not have a quiet place to study, their work will be affected. So, The answer is work/study. 34. Answer: fountain Some noises can be considered pleasant, e.g. the sound of a … in a town Here’s what the speaker says: Now, one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn’t differentiate between different types of noise. Some types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and relaxing might well score quite highly in decibel levels – think of the sound made by a fountain in a town square, for example. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (fountain): pleasant = nice and relaxing Explanation: Some sounds might be quite loud – they score highly in decibel levels. However, we might consider some of these sounds to be pleasant, and the speaker gives the example of a fountain in a town square. The answer is fountain. 35. Answer: social To investigate this, researchers may use methods from … sciences e.g.g questionaires Here’s what the speaker says: So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design. This is going to be tricky because just measuring decibel levels isn’t going to help us here. Instead, many researchers are using social science techniques, studying people’s emotional response to sound by using questionnaires and so on. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (social): methods = techniques Explanation: In urban design, it is important to consider the effect of different types of noise, so just measuring decibel levels is not enough. Instead, to investigate this problem, researchers are using methods like questionnaires, which are used by the social sciences. The correct answer is social. 36. Answer: lively Plenty of activity in urban environments which are … , but also allow people to relax Here’s what the speaker says: So what exactly do people want to hear in an urban environment? Some recent interdisciplinary research has come out with results that at first sight seem contradictory – a city needs to have a sense of activity, so it needs to be lively, with sounds like the clack of high heels on a pavement or the hiss of a coffee machine, but these mustn’t be too intrusive, because at the same time we need to be able to relax. Here are some urban environment = a city key words that help you to get the correct answer (lively): Explanation: The research found that a city should have a lot of activity, but should also be a place to relax, so the noise shouldn’t be too loud (intrusive) that it disturbs people. So, as well as relaxing, a city should be lively. The answer is lively. 37. Answer: training Do not get much … in acoustics Here’s what the speaker says: One of the major problems in achieving this will be getting architects and town planners to use the research. Apart from studying the basics of acoustics, these people receive very little training in this area. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (lively): get = receive Explanation: The speaker now talks about architects and town planners. They only study the basics of acoustics, so they may not decide to use the research. The problem is that they do not receive much training in acoustics. The answer is training. 38. Answer: culture How sound relates to … Here’s what the speaker says: What’s needed is for noise in cities to be regarded as an aesthetic quality, as something that has the qualities of an art form. If we acknowledge this, then we urgently need to know what governs it and how designers can work with it. We need to develop a complex understanding of many factors. What is the relationship between sound and culture? Explanation: Talking about noise in terms of art forms, the speaker mentions the need to understand the relationship between sound and culture. We need to know how sound relates to culture. The answer is culture. 39. Answer: nature Whether physics can help us understand the … of sound Here’s what the speaker says: Can we learn anything from physics about the nature of sound? Explanation: The speaker mentions other disciplines which might be useful in understanding how sound interacts with human development and social relationships. Psychology and physics are mentioned. The speaker asks if we can learn anything from physics about the nature of sound itself. The answer is nature. 40. Answer: silent Current disadvantage: they are … Here’s what the speaker says: To show us their ideas and help us to imagine the effect their buildings will have, architects and town planners already use virtual reality – but these programs are silent .In future such programs could use realistic sounds, meaning that soundscapes could be explored before being built. Explanation: irtual reality programs are already used, but they are silent (they only show images). In future, Vsound could be included in virtual reality programs, but the current disadvantage (at the moment) is that they do not include sound. The answer is silent.",

Answer: sugar 9. Answer: stamps 10. Answer: parking SECTION 2 11-12. Answer: D 55-64 years, E over 65 years Which TWO age groups are taking increasing numbers of holidays with BC Travel? Here’s what the speaker says: In terms of age groups, the over-65s are an important market,and one that’s increasing steadily year on year. The fewest holidays are taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds, and that figure shows no sign of rising. The biggest market at present is still the youngest group, the 16 to 30s, but this group’s also seen the biggest drop over the last few years, whereas there’s a noticeable growth in the number of holidays taken by the 55 to 64-year-olds. As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned, bookings there are steady, but I have to say we haven’t seen the increase we expected. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (D E): increasing = growth/rising Explanation: Remember that the question is about the age groups that are taking INCREASING number of holidays, not those that are taking the MOST holidays. Because the over-65s age-group is increasing steadily and the 55-64-year-olds is growing noticeably, the correct answers are D and E. The answers are D E. 13-14. Answer: A Clients make new friends, C Clients learn about a difference culture Which TWO are the main reasons given for the popularity of activity holidays? Here’s what the speaker says: Activity holidays usually involve rather less high-risk sports, or things like art and music. They’re not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite, in fact. But they do often take place outside the main tourist centres, which gives an opportunity for clients to find out more about the local people and customs, and many say this is one of the most positive features of these holidays. Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or talent, but clients often say that more than this, it’s the chance to create lasting relationships with other like-minded people that’s the main draw. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (A C): friends = like-minded people culture = local people and customs learn = find out Explanation: According to the speaker, “Activity holidays usually involve rather less high-risk sports” and there is no mention about the excitement of customers towards risky activities, so D is incorrect. This type of holiday is usually more expensive than an ordinary one, so E is also incorrect. Be careful with answer B because it is said in the recording that clients can develop a new skill, but in fact this feature is less appreciated than the chance to create relationships with like-minded people, or “friends”. So A is the correct answer. The speaker also says that an activity holiday provides the opportunity to “find out more about the local people and customs”, meaning customers can learn about a new culture, so C is correct. The answers are A C. 15. Answer: C. by employing more teachers How does BC Travel plan to expand the painting holidays? Here’s what the speaker says: Our painting holidays take place in four different centres in France and Italy and they’re very popular with clients of all abilities from beginners onwards. We’ve got an excellent team of artists to lead the classes – some of them have been with us from the start, and five additional ones will be joining us this year so that we can offer a greater number of classes in each centre. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): more = additional Explanation: The speaker mentions different locations and levels but these will not change in the future. What will change is that five more teachers will be employed, increasing the number of classes. We have to understand that the artists who lead the classes are the teachers. The answer is C. 16. Answer: B. They have an international focus Why are BC Travel’s cooking holidays unusual? Here’s what the speaker says: As far as cooking holidays are concerned, I know a lot of agents offer holidays where clients cook recipes related to one particular country, usually the one they’re staying in, but we focus on dishes from a great many different ones. Apart from that you’ll find the usual emphasis on good quality, organic ingredients – that’s more or less a given nowadays – and there are generally some meat-free recipes included. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): foods = ingredients vegetarian = meat-free dishes = recipes Explanation: Although organic foods, and vegetarian (“meat-free”) recipes are mentioned in the recording, these features are not exclusive to BC Travel (‘it’s a given nowadays’). What makes BC Travel different from others is that they focus on dishes from many cultures, which means that the dishes are “international”. The answer is B. 17. Answer: A. Clients receive individual tuition What does the speaker say about the photography holidays? Here’s what the speaker says: Groups are small, no more than eight, so clients can have one-on-one tuitionduring the holiday, and excursions are arranged with fully-trained guides. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): individual = one-on-one Explanation: The holiday offer trained guides, but it is not stated whether these guides are also tutors or not, so B is incorrect. C is irrelevant because there is no mention about selling the photographs, but about the exhibiton instead. Lastly, “clients can have one-on-one tuition” (“one-on-one” means individual) so the answer has to be A. The answer is A. 18. Answer: stress also reduces … Here’s what the speaker says: In Ireland and Italy we run one-week general fitness classes for all ages and levels of fitness. Clients start the course with a consultation with a trainer, and together they draw up an individual programme. As well as improving general fitness, clients find that they end up losing much of the stress they’ve built up in their daily lives. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): reduce = lose much of Explanation: After mentioning that the client ‘draws up’ = designs an individual programme with a trainer, the other advantage is mentioned – ‘losing much of the stress’ from their daily lives. The answer is stress. 19. Answer: weight … control Here’s what the speaker says: In Greece, we have a two-week holiday for clients who want to do something about their weight. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): reduce = lose much of Explanation: The holiday in Greece is for clients who ‘want to do something about’ their weight. We understand that they want to lose weight or control it. The answer is weight. 20. Answer: families one holiday that is specially designed for … Here’s what the speaker says: Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco. One very popular one is the mountain biking holiday. Bikes are provided and there are different routes according to people’s ability. We offer one which is tailored to the needs of families, which is particularly popular. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (families): designed for = tailored to the needs of Explanation: The holiday in Greece is for clients who ‘want to do something about’ their weight. We understand that they want to lose weight or control it. The answer is families. SECTION 3 21. Answer: C Locate and read relevant articles, noting key information and also … Here’s what the speakers say: DAVE: Did you remember to keep a record of where you got the information from? NATALIE: Sure. I know what a pain it is when you forget that. Explanation: The places or people where you get information from are your ‘sources’. The answer is C – sources. 22. Answer: E Select interviewees – these may be site … Here’s what the speakers say: DAVE: And then think about who we’re going to interview to get more information. NATALIE: OK. So who’d that be? The people who work there? And presumably some of the tourists too? Explanation: The people who work at a site or place are the employees. The answer is E – employees. 23. Answer: H visitors or city … Here’s what the speakers say: DAVE: But we might also do some of our interviewing away from the site – we could even contact some people here in the city, like administrators involved in overseeing tourism. Explanation: The administrators in the city who are responsible for tourism are the officials. The answer is H – officials. 24. Answer: B Check whether … of interviewees can be used Here’s what the speakers say: DAVE: But Dr Baker also said we have to establish with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our case study, or whether they want to be anonymous. NATALIE: Oh, I wouldn’t have thought of that. Here are some names = identify them key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): Explanation: Some interviewees may wish to be anonymous, that is they may not want to give their names. The answer is B – names. 25. Answer: A Select relevant information and try to identify … Here’s what the speakers say: : OK, once we’ve got all this information, I suppose we have to NATALIEanalyse it. and : Yes, put it all together and choose what’s relevant to the problem we’re focusing on, DAVEanalyse carefully to find out if we can identify any trends or regularities there. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): patterns = trends on regularities Explanation: Some interviewees may wish to be anonymous, that is they may not want to give their names. The answer is A – patterns. 26. Answer: F Do NOT end with … Here’s what the speakers say: DAVE: Then the case study itself is mostly quite standard; we begin by presenting the problem, and giving some background, then go through the main sections, but the thing that surprised me is that in a normal report we’d end with some suggestions to deal with the problem or need we identified, but in a case study we end up with a question or a series of questions to our readers, and they decide what ought to be done. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (F): solutions = suggestions to deal with the problem Explanation: We have to be careful with this answer. The report will end with questions, for the readers to answer. So, D is not correct. Instead, the report must NOT end with solutions, even though a normal report usually does this. The answer is F – solutions. 27. Answer: A the publicity is poor. Natalie and Dave agree one reason why so few people visit Horton Castle is that Here’s what the speakers say: NATALIE: So basically, the problem we’re addressing in our case study of the Horton Castle site is why so few tourists are visiting it. And we’ll find out more from our interviews, but I did find one report on the internet that suggested that one reason might be because as far as transport goes, access is difficult. DAVE: I read that too, but that report was actually written ten years ago, when the road there was really bad, but that’s been improved now. And I think there’s plenty of fascinating stuff there for a really good day out, but you’d never realise it from the castle website – maybe that’s the problem. NATALIE: Yes, it’s really dry and boring. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): publicity = website get to = access of interesting = fascinating Explanation: Natalie says that the reason could be “difficult access”, which means that the castle is “difficult to get to” but Dave disagrees, saying the information is too old and is no longer true. So B is not the answer. And the fact that “there’s plenty of fascinating stuff there” contradicts answer C that “there is little there of interest”, so C is wrong too. Why the castle is visited by so few people is their “dry and boring” website which does not show off the best of the castle, so tourists do not realise how much there is to see and do. Therefore the problem has to do with “publicity” (how people see and acknowledge the place). The correct answer is A. The ANSWER: A 28. Answer: C dealing with planning restrictions. Natalie and Dave agree that the greatest problem with a visitor centrecould be Here’s what the speakers say: : OK. And as we’re thinking of suggesting a visitor DAVEcentrewe’d also have to look at potential problems. I mean, obviously it wouldn’t be cheap to set up. NATALIE: No, but it could be a really good investment. And as it’s on a historical site it’d need to get special planning permission, I expect. That might be hard. DAVE: Right, especially as the only possible place for it would be at the entrance, and that’s right in front of the castle. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): Planning restrictions = special planning permissions Explanation: Dave mentions a possible problem of cost (“it wouldn’t be cheap to set up”) but Natalie thinks that is not a problem because the centre could attract investors. So A is incorrect. The two talk about the place for the centre, but there is a big enough space in front of the castle. So, B is incorrect. Instead, they worry that getting “special planning permission” (the same as “planning restrictions”) could be hard because the centre would be in front of the castle. Thus, C is the answer. The ANSWER: C 29. Answer: B There are few people of working age. What does Dave say about conditions in the town of Horton? Here’s what the speakers say: : But it could be a good thing for the town of Horton. At DAVEpresent it’s a bit of a ghost town. Once they’ve left school and got any skills or qualifications, the young people all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city, and the only people left are children and those who’ve retired. Explanation: Young people with skills and qualifications could be considered as “skilled workers”. Because they all left Horton for jobs in the city, it can be inferred that the town does not offer opportunities for them, so C is wrong. There is no mention about how many people are working/not working so “unemployment” is irrelevant, thus A is incorrect. However, the speaker says that the only people left in Horton are children and retired citizens, who are not of “working age”, indicating that there are not many people of working age here. The ANSWER: B 30. Answer: B make visitors keep to the paths. According to Natalie, one way to prevent damage to the castle site would be to Here’s what the speakers say: : Right. Something else we could investigate would be the potential damage that tourists might cause to the castle site, I mean their environmental impact. At NATALIE the tourists can just wander presentround wherever they want, but if numbers increase, there might have to be some restrictions, like sticking to marked ways. And there’d need to be guides and wardens around to make sure these were enforced. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): Keep to = stick to Paths = marked ways Explanation: When the speaker says “if numbers increase” you might think that the solution would have to do with “limit visitor numbers”, however it is not the case. In fact, the speaker suggests some restrictions, marked ways to be specific. So, “marked ways” can be considered a type of “path” that the visitors have to “stick to” (or “keep to”) so the answer is B. Note that “guides” are mentioned but they are employed to make sure tourists do not stray away from the paths, not to accompany them, so A is wrong. The ANSWER: B SECTION 4 31. Answer: insects It has also recently been found to affect birds which feed on … Here’s what the speaker says: But the problem is that the amount of mercury in the environment’s increasing………Some of this gets deposited into lakes and rivers, and if it’s ingested by a fish, it stays in the fish’s body and it enters the food chain. So it’s been known for some time that birds which eat fish may be affected, but what wasn’t known until quite recently is that those that eat insects can also be affected. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (insects): feed on = eat Explanation: It has been known for quite a long time that birds which eat fish may be affected by mercury. Recent research has also found that birds which eat insects can also be affected by mercury. The answer is insects. 32. Answer: behaviour/behavior the effects on birds’ … or mental processes, e.g. memory Here’s what the speaker says: So a woman called Claire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting birds. And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by mercury poisoning, she’s looking for more subtle sub-effects. And these may be to do with the behaviour of the birds, or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works, so whether it leads to problems with memory, for example. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (behaviour/behavior): investigating = doing research mental processes = the way their brain works Explanation: This researcher is looking at the effect that mercury has on the brains of birds and their behaviour, and the problems that mercury may cause, for example in terms of memory. The answer is behaviour/behavior 33. Answer: father the effects on bird song (usually learned from a bird’s … ) Here’s what the speaker says: And she’s particularly focusing on the effects of mercury on bird song. Now, the process of song-learning happens at a particular stage in the birds’ development, and what you may not know is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by listening to the songs produced by its father, rather than by any other bird. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (father): learn = acquire Explanation: The speaker says that this same researcher is studying/investigating bird song. In particular, young birds seem to learn songs by listening to the songs produced by the father, not by any other bird. The answer is father. 34. Answer: complex/complicated songs learned by birds exposed to mercury are less … Here’s what the speaker says: And Varian-Ramos has already found in her research that if young male birds are exposed to mercury, if they eat food contaminated with mercury, then the songs they produce aren’t as complex as those produced by other birds. Explanation: If young male birds eat food which contains mercury, then this seems to affect their mental processes. The songs which they are able to produce are not as complex as the songs of other birds. The answer is complex/complicated 35. Answer: reproduction/breeding this may have a negative effects on birds’ … Here’s what the speaker says: So quite low-level exposure to mercury is likely to have an impact on male birds in a natural situation, because it can mean that they’re less attractive to female birds, and so it can affect their chances of reproduction. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (reproduction/breeding): have a negative effect on = affect their chances of Explanation: Male birds exposed to mercury have songs which are less complex than those of other birds. As a result, they are less likely to attract females, and this will have a negative effect on their chances of reproduction. The answer is reproduction/breeding. 36. Answer: control allow more … for the experimenter Here’s what the speaker says: She’s using a mixture of studies using birds kept in laboratories, and studies carried out outdoors in the wild. The lab-based studies have the advantage that you don’t get all the variables you would in a natural setting, so the experimenter has a much higher level of control, and that means they can be more confident about their results in some ways. Explanation: Using experiments on birds kept in laboratories (=lab-based studies), she is able to have more control than in the studies conducted outdoors. There are fewer variables to consider. The answer is control. 37. Answer: ducks Migrating birds such as … containing mercury may be eaten by humans Here’s what the speaker says: So what are the implications here for humans? Well, because many birds are migratory, they may be transporting mercury far from contaminated sites. For example, it’s been found that ducks who’d been feeding at a contaminated site were later shot by hunters over a thousand kilometres away, and presumably eaten. But these birds likely had mercury levels high enough to warrant concern for human consumption. Here are some eaten by humans = human consumption key words that help you to get the correct answer (ducks): Explanation: The example given of birds which migrate (migratory birds) is ducks. These have been found to contain mercury, as a result of eating at distant contaminated sites. The answer is ducks. 38. Answer: language Mercury also causes problems in learning … Here’s what the speaker says: In addition, going back to song-learning by birds, we saw that this may be affected by mercury contamination. Well, we also know that in humans, mercury causes developmental delays in the acquisition of language…. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (language): learning = acquisition Explanation: The speaker says that mercury also causes problems in humans, not only in birds. The problems of birds in learning songs iscompared to the problems (= developmental delays) in learning language in humans. The answer is language. 39. Answer: food Mercury in mother’s body from … may affect the unborn child Here’s what the speaker says: But mercury contamination has other important implications for humans as well. It’s now known that an unborn child can be affected if the food eaten by its mother contains high levels of mercury, and these effects can be quite substantial. Explanation: The affect of eating food contaminated by mercury is discussed by the speaker. An unborn child can be affected if the mother eats food which contains high levels of mercury. The answer is food. 40. Answer: costs/prices/bills New regulations for mercury emissions will affect everyone’s energy … Here’s what the speaker says: It’s true there are new regulations for mercury emissions from power plants, but these will need billions of dollars to implement, and increase costs for everyone. Some argue that’s too much to pay to protect wildlife. But as we’ve seen, the issues go beyond that, and I think it’s an issue we need to consider very carefully. Explanation: The speaker mentions new regulations for mercury emissions. Because these will be expensive to implement, everyone will have to pay more for energy (from power plants). In other words, energy costs for everyone will increase. The answer is costs/prices/bills.",

Answer: outdoor 10. Answer: logo SECTION2 11. Answer: B. coffee Here’s what the speaker says: The flight is at 11.30, so it’s too early to have lunch at the airport. I suggestwe meet there for coffee at 10, which should give us plenty of time for breakfast before we leave home. Explanation: All three answers appear in the recording, but we need to understand it thoroughly. The speaker says that it is too early to have lunch at the airport and that they will have breakfast AT HOME. Thus A and C are incorrect. The speaker also suggests they meet at the airport for coffee, so B is the answer. 12. Answer: C. a tour operator. Here’s what the speaker says: When we arrive in Munich, we’ll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer. Claus works for a tour operator, and he’ll look after us for the time we’ll be in Germany. Explanation: It is clear from the script that the group will be met at the airport by a tour operator. The answer is C. 13. Answer: A. 110 euros Here’s what the speaker says: The normal rate at the hotel where we’re staying is 150 euros a night for a double room. I’d hoped to get that down to 120 euros, but in fact I’ve been able to negotiate a rate of 110. Explanation: Although 110, 120 and 150 all appear in the recording, the speaker says he has negotiated a rate of 110 euros, so that is the final price for the double room. The answer is A. 14. Answer: B. a Lebanese restaurant Here’s what the speaker says: On Tuesday evening, we’ll all have dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel. From talking to you all about your preferences, it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be too meat-oriented for some of you. Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant, but I must confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one, as we have plenty of opportunities to go to an Italian restaurant at home. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): region = local Explanation: The speaker says that a typical local restaurant would not fit the group’s preferences, because it would serve a lot of meat dishes and that an Italian one would be easy to find at home, so A and C are wrong. Eventually he has decided to book a Lebanese restaurant. Hence, B is the correct answer. 15. Answer: C. a theatre director Here’s what the speaker says: On Wednesday afternoon, the director of the play we’re going to see that evening will talk to us at the theatre. She’ll describe the whole process of producing a play, including how she chose the actors, and, as the play we’re going to see is a modern one, how she worked with the playwright. Explanation: On Wednesday afternoon, they will meet a director, not an actor nor a playwright. They will only hear the director talk about these. Therefore, the correct answer can only be C. 16. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: – The play we’re seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one, and we’re going to the premiere. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (F): premiere = first time Explanation: The play on Wednesday will be the premiere, which means that it will be performed for the first time. F is the answer. 17. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: – On Thursday we’re seeing a play that was first performed last year, when it was commissioned to mark a hundred years since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): written = commissioned anniversary = birth celebrate = mark Explanation: The play on Thursday “was commissioned”, which means that it was speciallywritten, with the aim of marking the 100th anniversary of a scientist’s birthday. Therefore the answer has to be B. 18. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: – Friday’s play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack, as it’ll be in the garden of a palace. It’s a beautiful setting, but I’d better warn you, there won’t be much protection from the wind. Explanation: The Friday play will take place in a garden, plus the speaker says it will be windy so we can conclude that the play will be outdoors. The correct answer is E. 19. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: – On Saturday, we’re going by coach to a theatre in another town, not far from Munich. This will be the opening of a drama festival, and the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town will be attending. After the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience, and there’ll be a band playing traditional music of the region. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (G): officials = mayor and dignitaries Explanation: The Saturday play will be attended by “the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town”, which refers to the town’s “officials”. Thus G is the correct answer. Also, be careful when the speaker says there will be a band because the band will play AFTER the play, not at the play. The correct answer is G. 20. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: – Our final play is on Monday, and it’s in the stunning setting of the old Town Hall, which dates back to the 14th century. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): historic = old Explanation: The play on Monday will be at the Town Hall which is described as “old” and “dates back to the 14th century” (thesame as “historic”). Thus the answer is obviously C. SECTION 3 21. Answer: C. a number of Danish people visited his family. Here’s what the speakers say: – Now as this is your first tutorial since you started on the Scandinavian Studies course, I’d like to find out something about you. Why did you decide to take this course? – Well, mv mother is Danish, and although we always lived in England, she used to talk about her home a lot, and that made me want to visit Denmark. We hardly ever did, though – my mother usually went on her own. But whenever her relations or friends were in England they always came to see us. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): spoke = talk about visited = came to see Explanation: James’ mother is Danish and she often talked to him BUT it is not sure that she talked to him in Danish, so B is not correct. James says they hardly visited Denmark (“hardly” is opposite to “often”), and his mother usually visited on her own. Hence A is not correct either. On the other hand, the relations and friends of his mother from Denmark visited their family so C is the correct answer. The correct answer is C. 22. Answer: B. work in the media. Here’s what the speakers say: – Do you have any plans for when you graduate? A lot of students go on to take a master’s degree. – I think the four years of the undergraduate course will be enough for me. I’m interested in journalism, and I quite like the idea of moving to Scandinavia and writing for magazines. I’d find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most graduates do. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): postgraduate course = master’s degree the media = magazines translator = translating Explanation: James does not want to continue studying after he graduates as “four years of the undergraduate course will be enough”, so A is incorrect. Additionally, he prefers “writing for magazines” as a journalist to translating, which means he wants to “work in the media” rather than become a translator. The correct answer must be B. 23. Answer: C. Scandinavian literature Here’s what the speaker says: – Well, I’m really enjoying the one on Swedish cinema. – That’ll continue next term, but the one on Scandinavian literature that’s running at the moment will be replaced by more specialised courses. Oh, and by the way, if you’re interested in watching Danish television programmes – there’s going to be a course on that the term after next. Explanation: Swedish cinema will continue next term, thus A is incorrect. And the course on Danish television programmes has not even started yet, so B is wrong as well. Beth says that Scandinavian literature will be replaced next term, indicating that it will end after the current term. Therefore, C is the answer. 24. Answer: A. 19th century playwrights. Here’s what the speakers say: BETH: Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you have to write in the next few weeks? JAMES: Yes, my first choice would be to do something on the Icelandic sagas. BETH: Hmm. The trouble with that is that a lot of people choose that topic, and it can be difficult to get hold of the books you’ll need. Why not leave that for another time? JAMES: Right. BETH: You might find modern novels or 19th century playwrights interesting. JAMES: I’ve read or seen several plays in translation, so that would be a good idea. BETH: Fine. I’ll put you down for that topic. Explanation: James’ first choice of Icelandic sagas was not encouraged, because Beth thinks it would be difficult to acquire necessary materials, so B is wrong. She then suggests modern novels or 19th century playwrights. James says that he has “read or seen several plays” so that topic would be a good idea. Beth then puts James’ name down for that paper, which means that they agree that he will write on that topic. The correct answer is A. 25. Answer: C. a study of the social background to the literature. Here’s what the speakers say: BETH: First I suggest you avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail. That approach certainly has its place, but I think you first need to get an understanding of the literature in the context of the society in which it was produced – who it was written for, how it was published, and so on. I also think that’s more fruitful than placing it within the history of the genre. JAMES: OK, that sounds reasonable. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): historical overview = history in-depth = a great deal of detail single = one social background = context of the society Explanation: Beth suggests “avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail” so B is obviously wrong. She is also against writing about the genre’s history (or “historical overview”) so A is also wrong. Her recommendation is putting the literature “in the context of the society in which it was produced”. This means that James needs to study the “social background” of the literature. Thus, the correct answer is C. 26. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: BETH: Well, what I suggest is that you read an assignment a student wrote last year, which is kept in the library. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (E): student paper = an assignment a student wrote Explanation: you need to know that an assignment is a task, and a written task by a student will be a student paper. So, the answer is E. 27. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: BETH: But I’ve got a recording of a documentary that you should watch. It makes some interesting and provocative points, which I think will help you to focus your topic. Explanation:Although James has a film of the Vikings, Beth thinks that it is more fantasy than reality, so she recommends a documentary which she will lend to James. The answer is G. 28. Answer: D Here’s what the speakers say: JAMES: So then I should work out an outline? BETH: Yes, just headings for different sections at this stage. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (D): outline = structure Explanation:The outline of the paper, with headings for the different sections will be the structure of James’ paper. The answer is D. 29. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: BETH: And then you should start looking for suitable articles and books to draw on, and take notes which you organise according to those headings. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): source materials = articles and books Explanation:James will use these materials to take notes. So, the answer is C. 30. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: BETH: Then put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading. Make sure that this skeleton makes sense and flows properly, before writing up the paper in full. Explanation:James will write these bullet points before writing the complete paper. The answer is A.

Answer: shops 10. Answer: 267 SECTION 2 11. Answer: A. the variety of work Here’s what the speaker says: – Good morning everyone. My name’s Joy Parkins and I’m the restaurant manager. And I understand that none of you’ve had any previous experience as kitchen assistants? Well, you might be feeling a bit nervous now, but most of our kitchen assistants say they enjoy the work. OK, they might get shouted at sometimes, but it’s nothing personal, and they’re pleased that they have so many different things to do, which means they never get bored. And I’ll tell you straightaway that if you do well, we might think about moving you up and giving you some more responsibility. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): variety = different work = things to do promotion = move up Explanation: The kitchen assistants might get shouted at, so “friendly atmosphere” is impossible. B is incorrect. In terms of promotion, the restaurant (the speaker) says that those who perform well will get to a higher position. However, the kitchen assistants say nothing about this opportunity. Thus C is not correct. What the kitchen assistants enjoy about their work is that they have “many different things to do”, which is the same as “variety of work”. The answer is A. 12. Answer: A. jewellery Here’s what the speaker says: – Now I’m glad to see none of you have unsuitable footwear, so that’s good – you need to be careful as the floors can get very wet and slippery. Those of you with long hair have got it well out of the way, but some of you’ll need to remove your rings and bracelets – just put them somewhere safe for today, and remember to leave them at home tomorrow, as they can be a safety hazard. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): shoes = footwear jewellery = rings and bracelets Explanation: According to the speaker, none of the staff have unsuitable “footwear” (the same as “shoes”) so C is not the answer. About hairstyles, people with long hair “have got it well out of the way” so that should not be a problem either and B is wrong. However, for safety reasons, the speaker warns some staff to remove their rings and bracelets, which are two kinds of jewellery. Therefore, the answer is A. 13. Answer: C. the restaurant is almost fully booked. Here’s what the speaker says: Now it’s going to be a busy day for you all today – we don’t have any tables free for this evening, and only a few for lunch. Fortunately we’ve got our Head Chef back – he was away on holiday all last week which meant the other chefs had extra work. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): absent = away Explanation: The word “holiday” appears in both the recording and answer A, but in the recording the speaker says that the Head Chef was away on holiday. A public holiday is not mentioned, so A is irrelevant. The Head Chef is now back to work, so B is wrong. The restaurant does not have any tables free for that evening, and only a few for lunch, which means that it is “almost fully booked”. Therefore, the answer is C. 14. Answer: C. the meat slicer. Here’s what the speaker says: – For all of you, whatever your age, there’s some equipment you mustn’t use until you’ve been properly trained, like the waste disposal system for example, for health and safety reasons. Then I think there are two of you here who are under 18 – that’s Emma and Jake, isn’t it? Right.so for you two, the meat slicer is out of bounds. And of course none of you are allowed to use the electric mixer until you’ve been shown how it works. Explanation: The speaker warns the staff, whatever their age, not to use the waste disposal system and the electric mixer until they know how the equipment works. Thus A and B does not answer the question. Emma and Jake, who are under 18, are not allowed to use the meat slicer (“out of bounds” means not allowed). Therefore C is the correct answer. 15-16. Answer: A. They have to follow orders immediately., E. The work is physically demanding. Here’s what the speaker says: – Now you may have heard that this can be a stressful job, and I have to say that can be true. You’ll be working an eight-hour day for the first week, though you’ll have the chance to do overtime after that as well if you want to. But however long the hours are, you’ll get a break in the middle. What you will find is that you’re on your feet all day long, lifting and carrying, so if you’re not fit now you soon will be! You’ll find you don’t have much chance to take it easy – when someone tells you to do something you need to do it straightaway – but at least we do have a very efficient air conditioning system compared with some kitchens. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (A E): immediately = straightaway Explanation: The manager says that “when someone tells you to do something you need to do it straightaway”, meaning that you have to do it immediately, so A is correct. The kitchen has “a very efficient air conditioning system” so we can infer that it cannot get too hot, thus B is incorrect. Also, the staff can always take a break despite how long they have to work, so C is incorrect. With regard to overtime, the manager says that the staff can decide whether to do overtime or not, which means it is not compulsory, therefore D is incorrect. Lastly, the staff must be “on their feet all day long, lifting and carrying”, indicating that the job is really “physically demanding”, that is, it requires a lot of strength. Hence A and E are the answers. 17. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: – So as I said, I’m Joy Parkins and I decide who does what during the day and how long they work for. Explanation: Joy Parkins is responsible for the way the kitchen operates and the hours which the staff have to work (“how long they work for”) which means that he decides what each person has to do at what time, therefore she is in charge of the “timetable”. F is the answer. 18. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: – One person whose name you must remember is David Field. If you injure yourself at all, even if it’s really minor, you must report to him and he’ll make sure the incident is recorded and you get the appropriate treatment. He’s trained to give basic treatment to staff himself, or he’ll send you off somewhere else if necessary. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): first aid = basic treatment Explanation: If a member of staff gets injured, he needs to see David Field to get the right treatment. Then obviously David is responsible for “first aid”. C is the correct answer. 19. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: – Then there’s Dexter Wills – he’s the person you need to see if you smash a plate or something like that. Don’t just leave it and hope no one will notice – it’s really important to get things noted and replaced or there could be problems later. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (D): breakage = smash Explanation: Dexter is responsible for situations where a plate is smashed (or broken) so his responsibility is obviously “breakages”. D is the correct answer. 20. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: – And finally, there’s Mike Smith. He’s the member of staff who takes care of all the stores of perishables, so if you notice we’re getting low in flour or sugar or something. make sure you let him know so he can put in an order. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): food stocks = flour or sugar Explanation: Mike will put in an order if the kitchen runs out of flour, sugar or other food items, so he is responsible for “food stocks”. The correct answer is B. SECTION 3 21. Answer: B. how changes in society are reflected in public libraries Here’s what the speakers say:- Well, there’s so much we could look into. How libraries have changed over the centuries, for instance, or how different countries organise them. What do you think, Trudie?- Maybe we should concentrate on this country, and try and relate the changes in libraries to external developments, like the fact that far more people can read than a century ago, and that the local population may speak lots of different languages.- We could include something about changes in the source of funding, too.-Yes, but remember we’re only supposed to write a short paper, so it’s probably best if we don’t go into funding in any detail.- Right. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): changes in society = external developments Explanation: At first, Stewart suggests they should look into how different countries organize public libraries, which is the content of answer A. However, after that they both agree to choose just one country and “relate the changes in libraries to external developments”. The term “external developments” is similar to “changes in society” so the topic would investigate the link between libraries and the changes in society, which means B is correct. Note that the idea of libraries funding is mentioned but then withdrawn, thus C is incorrect. The answer is B. 22. Answer: C. they are generally old. Here’s what the speakers say: – But the digitalised books that are available online for free are mostly out of copyright, aren’t they? And copyright in this country lasts for 70 years after the author dies. So you won’t find the latest best-seller or up-to-date information. – That’s an important point. Anyway, I find it hard to concentrate when I’m reading a long text on a screen. I’d much rather read a physical book. And it takes longer to read on a screen. – Oh, I prefer it. I suppose it’s just a personal preference. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): difficult = hard Explanation: Remember that you are asked what the two both agree about digitalized books. Trudie thinks reading them is “hard to concentrate” (or “difficult”) and too time-consuming (“take longer to read”) but Stewart disagrees. Thus A and B are wrong answers. What they do agree with each other is that digitalized books are not “up-to-date”, meaning they are old, due to copyright regulations. C is correct. 23. Answer: C. no longer contain any books. Here’s what the speakers say: TRUDIE: Mm. I expect that libraries will go on evolving in the next few years. Some have already become centres where community activities take place, like local clubs meeting there. I think that’ll become even more common. STEWART: I’d like to think so, and that they’ll still be serving their traditional function, but I’m not so sure.Thereare financial implications, after all. What I’m afraid will happen is that books and magazines will all disappear, and there’ll just be rows and rows of computers. They won’t look anything like the libraries we’re used to. Explanation: Stewart hopes that libraries will continue their traditional function, but that is no what he expects, as he says “I’m not so sure”. Therefore A is not the answer. Libraries becoming centres for the community is the prediction of Trudie, not Stewart, so B is wrong as well. Stewart expects that “books and magazines will all disappear”, so libraries will not “contain any books”. C is the answer. 24. Answer: budget Here’s what the speakers say: – Let’s make a list of possible things we could ask about, then work out some sort of structure. For instance, um, we could interview some of the staff, and find out whether the library has its own budget, or if that’s controlled by the local council. Clearly, the word required is budget. 25. Answer: employment Here’s what the speakers say: – Then there are other things like how the library is affected by employment laws. I suppose there are rules about working hours, facilities for staff, and so on. Explanation: Stewart gives examples of different kinds of rules/laws which affect the working conditions of the staff. All of these laws/rules relate to the employment of the staff. The answer is employment. 26. Answer: safety Here’s what the speakers say: – Then there are other issues relating to the design of the building and how customers use it. Like what measures does the library take to ensure their safety? Explanation: Trudie is talking about the safety of customers here. The answer is safety. 27. Answer: insurance Here’s what the speakers say: – Oh, and another thing – there’s the question of the kind of insurance the library needs to have, in case anyone gets injured. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (insurance): accidents = anyone gets injured The answer is insurance. 28. Answer: diary Here’s what the speakers say: – Well, you know they’ve got an archive of local newspapers going back years? Well, next to it they’ve got the diary of a well-known politician from the late 19th century. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (diary): famous = well-known Explanation: the famous person referred to is a well-known politician from the past. The answer is diary. 29. Answer: database Here’s what the speakers say: – Oh, I’ve just thought – you know people might ask in the library about local organisations, like sports clubs? Well, I wonder if they keep a database, or whether they just look online. Explanation: this part refers to ‘local organisations’, and if the local library keeps a database of them. The answer is database. 30. Answer: museum Here’s what the speakers say: – Right. I quite fancy finding out what the differences are between a library that’s open to the public and one that’s part of a museum, for example – they must be very different. Explanation: the speaker would like to know the difference between a local library and a library in a museum. The answer is museum. SECTION 4 31. Answer: damage Here’s what the speaker says: In public discussion of business, we take certain values for granted……The trouble with these values is that they’re theoretical concepts, removed from the reality of day-to-day business. Pursue values by all means, but be prepared for what may happen as a result. They can actually cause damage, which is not at all the intention. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (damage): result in = cause Explanation: ‘They’ in the final sentence refers to the values which most people think are ‘good things’ in business. In fact, the speaker says, pursuing these values may actually damage business. The answer is damage. 32. Answer: side effects Here’s what the speaker says: Business leaders generally try to do the right thing. But all too often the right thing backfires, if those leaders adopt values without understanding and managing the side effects that arise. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (side effects): result = arise Explanation: if business leaders adopt values without understanding what may happen as a result, then there are dangers (doing the right thing ‘backfires’). Unforeseen consequences may result for the business, referred to as ‘side effects’. The answer is side effects. 33. Answer: bridge Here’s what the speaker says: OK. So the first value I’m going to discuss is collaboration. Er, let me give you an example. On a management training course I once attended, we were put into groups and had to construct a bridge across a stream, using building blocks that we were given. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (bridge): team = group build = construct Explanation: the example given by the speaker is about a management training course, designed to encourage team work through collaboration. The task was to build/construct a bridge. The answer is bridge. 34. Answer: confusion Here’s what the speaker says: The other teams tried to collaborate on building the structure and descended into confusion, with everyone getting in each other’s way. Explanation: the speaker continues the example, talking of the experience of the other teams who tried to collaborate in building the bridge. Because it was not suitable for a team task, the attempt to collaborate soon resulted in confusion. The answer is confusion. 35. Answer: smartphone Here’s what the speaker says: Teamwork can also lead to inconsistency – a common cause of poor sales. In the case of a smartphone that a certain company launched, one director wanted to target the business market, and another demanded it was aimed at consumers. The company wanted both directors to be involved, so gave the product a consumer-friendly name, but marketed it to companies. The result was that it met the needs of neither group. It would have been better to let one director or the other have his way, not both. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (smartphone): collaboration = teamwork Explanation: in another example of the failure of collaboration, the speaker talks about managers with two different ideas about marketing a smartphone. The attempt to combine these two opposing ideas resulted in poor sales. So, the answer is smartphone. 36. Answer: resources Here’s what the speaker says: Of course hard work is valuable, but only when properly targeted. Otherwise it wastes the resources that companies value most – time and energy. And that’s bad for the organisation. Explanation: although the speaker admits the value of hard work, it must be ‘properly targeted’. If this is not the case, time and energy may be wasted. These are the most valuable resources for a company. So the answer is resources. 37. Answer: unnecessary/not necessary Here’s what the speaker says: There’s a management model that groups people according to four criteria: clever, hard-working, stupid and lazy. Here ‘lazy’ means having a rational determination not to carry out unnecessary tasks. It doesn’t mean trying to avoid work altogether. Explanation: ‘lazy’ usually means wanting to avoid work. However, the speaker explains that the context of ‘lazy’ in the management model is different – it refers to people who avoid unnecessary tasks. The answer is unnecessary/not necessary. 38. Answer: chocolate bar Here’s what the speaker says: Some advertising campaigns are remembered for their creativity, without having any effect on sales. This happened a few years ago with the launch of a chocolate bar: subsequent research showed that plenty of consumers remembered the adverts, but had no idea what was being advertised. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (chocolate bar): memorable = consumers remembered failed to boost = without having any effect on Explanation: speaking about creativity, the speaker mentions an advertising campaign. People remembered the adverts, but could not remember the product advertised. Sales did not increase, therefore. The product was a chocolate bar. The answer is chocolate bar. 39. Answer: problem Here’s what the speaker says: Creativity needs to be targeted, to solve a problem that the company has identified. Just coming up with more and more novel products isn’t necessarily a good thing. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (problem): as a response to = solve Explanation: the speaker says that creativity must be targeted. If the company has a particular problem, then that is the time to use creativity to solve that problem. The answer is problem. 40. Answer: markeat share Here’s what the speaker says: A major study of company performance compared pioneers – that is, companies bringing out the first version of a particular product – with followers, the companies that copied and improved on that product. The study found that the pioneers commanded an average market share of 29 per cent, while the followers achieved less than half that, only 13 per cent, even though their product might have been better. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (market share): had = commanded Explanation: the study found that pioneers who brought out a new product had, on average, almost double the market share of companies which followed by bringing out a similar product. This percentage was ‘far higher’. So the answer is market share.",

      "content_clean": "SECTION 1 1. Answer: secondary Here’s what the speakers say: OK. And the venue is the school, isn’t it? –Yes, that’s right, the secondary school. Make sure you don’t go to the primary school by mistake! Explanation: The second speaker says: ‘the secondary school’. He says that it is a mistake to go to the primary school. So, the answer is secondary. 2. Answer: flute Here’s what the speakers say: And there’s an additional performer who isn’t mentioned on the posters – Carolyn Hart is going to play with the band Oh, I think I’ve heard her on the radio. Doesn’t she play the oboe, or flute or something? Yes, the flute. Explanation: although one speaker is not sure which musical instrument Carolyn Hart plays, her colleague confirms that Caroly Hart plays the flute. The answer is flute. 3. Answer: cinema Here’s what the speakers say: Well, you buy a yellow plastic duck – or as many as you like – they’re a pound each. And you write your name on each one. There’ll be several races, depending on the number of ducks taking part. And John Stevens, a champion swimmer who lives locally, is going to start the races. All the ducks will be launched into the river at the back of the cinema…… Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (cinema): start = launch something into the water behind = at the back of So, the answer is cinema. 4. Answer: concert Here’s what the speakers say: And are there any prizes? Yes, the first duck in each race to arrive at the finishing line wins its owner free tickets for the concert on the last night of the festival. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (concert): the end = the last night So, the answer is concert. 5. Answer: market Here’s what the speakers say: You said you can buy a duck? I’m sure my children will both want one. They’re on sale at a stall in the market. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (market): can be bought = on sale So, the answer is market. 6. Answer: Bythwaite Here’s what the speakers say: – Now, could you tell me something about the flower show, please? – Well, admission is free, and the show is being held in Bythwaite Hall. – Sorry, how do you spell that? – B-Y-T-H-W-A-I-T-E. Bythwaite. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (Bythwaite): venue = being held in So, the answer is Bythwaite. 7. Answer: actor Here’s what the speakers say: Yes, but if you’d like to see the prizes being awarded for the best flowers, you’ll need to be there at 5 o’clock. The prizes are being given by a famous actor, Kevin Shapless. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (actor): presented = given by well-known = famous So, the answer is actor. 8. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: What about ‘The Mystery of Muldoon’? That’s aimed at five to ten-year-olds. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): suitable for = aimed at children = five to ten-year-olds Explanation: One speaker says that ‘The Mystery of Muldoon’ is aimed at five to ten-year-olds, which means that the play is “mainly for children”. The answer is A. 9. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: If you’d like something for yourself and your husband, and leave your children with a babysitter, you might like to see ‘Fire and Flood’ – it’s about events that really happened in Stretton two hundred years ago, and children might find it rather frightening. Explanation: According to the speaker, ‘Fire and Flood’ is not suitable for children as it could frighten them. Instead, the play could be enjoyable to the married couple (“yourself and your husband”) so we can infer that it is “mainly for adults”. The answer is B. 10. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: And finally, what about ‘Silly Sailor’? That’s a comedy, and it’s for young and old. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): children = young adult = old Explanation: The speaker says that ‘Silly Sailor’ is suitable for both the young, that is “children”, and the old, that is “adults”. Therefor the answer must be C. SECTION 2 11. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: Well, for one thing, we have a fine collection of twentieth and twenty-first century paintings, many by very well-known artists. I’m sure you’ll recognise several of the paintings. This is the gallery that attracts the largest number of visitors, so it’s best to go in early in the day, before the crowds arrive. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (E): most popular = largest number of visitors Explanation: The speaker says that the gallery of 20th- and 21st-century paintings “attracts the largest number of visitors”, which can be understood that these paintings are among the “most popular” in the museum. The answer is E. 12. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: Then there are the nineteenth-century paintings. The museum was opened in the middle of that century, and several of the artists each donated one work – to get the museum started, as it were. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (D): give = donate item = work = painting Explanation: According to the recording, some of the19th-century paintings were “donated” by the artists, meaning that the museum was “given” those paintings. The correct answer is D. 13. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: The sculpture gallery has a number of fine exhibits, but I’m afraid it’s currently closed for refurbishment. You’ll need to come back next year to see it properly, but a number of the sculptures have been moved to other parts of the museum. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (G): relocated = moved some = a number of contents = sculptures Explanation: Concerning sculptures, it is said that “a number of the sculptures have been moved” to somewhere else, that is, they have been “relocated”. Therefore the answer is clearly G. 14. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: ‘Around the world’ is a temporary exhibition – you’ve probably seen something about it on TV or in the newspapers. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): media = TV/newspapers Explanation: The speaker mentions that ‘Around the world’ has appeared on TV or in the newspapers, which are two forms of the media. Therefore, we can infer that the exhibiton has appeard on the media, so the answer must be B. 15. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: Then there’s the collection of coins. This is what you might call a focused, specialist collection, because all the coins come from this country, and were produced between two thousand and a thousand years ago. And many of them were discovered by ordinary people digging their gardens. and donated to the museum! Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): given = donated the public = ordinary people Explanation: Although the word “country” apprears in both the recording and answer F, the meaning of answer F is completely irrelevant, so you need to be careful with this type of answer. The speaker says that many coins were discovered by “ordinary people”, which refers to “the public”, and were donated to the museum. Therefore, it is clear that some items in the coin collection were given by the public. The correct answer is C. 16. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: All our porcelain and glass was left to the museum by its founder, when he died in 1878. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): given = left Explanation: Because ALL the porcelain and glass was “left” to the museum by its founder, it can be understood that the collection was entirely given by one person. Thus, A is the correct answer. 17. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: We have a very good restaurant, which serves excellent food all day, in a relaxing atmosphere. To reach it, when you get to the bottom of the stairs, go straight ahead to the far side of the sitting area, then turn right into the corridor. You’ll see the door of the restaurant facing you. Following these instructions, the correct answer is F. 18. Answer: H Here’s what the speaker says: If you just want a snack, or if you’d like to eat somewhere with facilities for children, we also have a café. When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you’ll need to go straight ahead, turn right into the corridor and the café is immediately on the right. Following these instructions, the correct answer is H. 19. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: And talking about children, there are baby-changing facilities downstairs: cross the sitting area, continue straight ahead along the corridor on the left, and you and your baby will find the facilities on the left-hand side. Following these instructions, the correct answer is C. 20. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: The cloakroom, where you should leave coats, umbrellas and any large bags, is on the left hand side of the sitting area. It’s through the last door before you come to the corridor. Following these instructions, the correct answer is B. SECTION 3 21-22 Answer: B They had all made music recordings., D They had all toured internationally. Here’s what the speakers say: Well, I had six subjects, all professional musicians, and all female. Three were violinists and there was also a cello player and a pianist and a flute player. They were all very highly regarded in the music world and they’d done quite extensive tours in different continents and quite a few had won prizes and competitions as well. And they were quite young, weren’t they?Yes, between 25 and 29 – the mean was 27.8. I wasn’t specifically looking for artists who’d produced recordings, but this is something that’s just taken for granted these days, and they all had. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (B D): internationally = different continents Explanation: A is wrong because not all had won prizes. Quite a few had won prizes, which means a lot – but not all – of them. E is also wrong because the subjects include one flute player, and the flute is not a string instrument. Joanna says that the subjects were aged “between 25 and 29”, so they CANNOT all be under 27, hence C is wrong. According to the recording, all of them had done “quite extensive tours in different continents”, which refers to the fact that they had toured “internationally” so D is correct. Additionally, Joanna says that although she did not require this, she chose all subjects who had made their own recordings. So, B is also correct. Therefore, B and D are the answers. 23-24.Answer: A It meant rich data could be collected., B It allowed the involvement of top performers. Here’s what the speakers say: Right. Now you collected your data through telephone interviews, didn’t you? Yes. I realised if I was going to interview leading musicians it’d only be possible over the phone because they’re so busy. I recorded them using a telephone recording adaptor. I’d been worried about the quality, but it worked out all right. I managed at least a 30-minute interview with each subject, sometimes longer. Did doing it on the phone make it more stressful? I’d thought it might … it was all quite informal though and in fact they seemed very keen to talk. And I don’t think using the phone meant I got less rich data, rather the opposite in fact. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (A B): top = leading performers = musicians Explanation: Joanna thought telephone interviews would be stressful, but in fact it was “quite informal” so C is incorrect. She also says that her interviews lasted for at least 30 minutes each, from which we can infer that interview time is not a problem. Therefore D is not the answer. Lastly, with regard to technical problems, Joanna says that “it worked out all right”, despite her initial worry about the quality of the telephone recording adaptor. Thus E is also wrong. B is the answer because she says “I was going to interview leading musicians”, which is similar to “top performers”. In addition, she does not think that telephone interviews meant less rich data, “rather the opposite in fact”, so she ACTUALLY got quite rich data, so A is correct. A and B are the answers. 25-26.Answer: B audience reactions to the dress of performers, E links between musical instrument and dress choice Here’s what the speakers say: My research investigated the way players see their role as a musician and how this is linked to the type of clothing they decide to wear. But that focus didn’t emerge immediately. When I started I was more interested in trying to investigate the impact of what was worn on those listening, and also whether someone like a violinist might adopt a different style of clothing from, say, someone playing the flute or the trumpet. It’s interesting that the choice of dress is up to the individual, isn’t it?Yes, you’d expect there to be rules about it in orchestras, but that’s quite rare. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (B E): originally = when I started performer = player dress = clothing audience = those listening regulations = rules Explanation: Joanna says that rules about clothing in the orchestras are quite rare, but that is not what she wanted to investigate so A is incorrect. Initially she was interested in “the impact of what was worn on those listening”. What was worn refers to the clothing of the player, and those listening refers to the audience, so the phrase can be understood as “audience reactions to the dress of performers”, hence Bis correct. There is no mention of the “performer attitudes” so C is irrelevant. Joanna studies the link between dress and how performers see their roles, so we might think D is correct. However, that is NOT what she intended to investigate in the first place (“that focus didn’t emerge immediately”). The correct answer is E because she compares the style of different players, whether the role affects their style of dress or not. So it can be inferred as the “link between musical instrument and dress choice”. The answers are B and E. 27. Answer: C. women’s code of dress is less strict than men’s. Here’s what the speakers say: You only had women performers in your study. Was that because male musicians are less worried about fashion? I think a lot of the men are very much influenced by fashion, but in social term the choices they have are more limited … they’d really upset audiences if they strayed away from quite narrow boundaries. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): code = boundaries strict = limited Explanation: A contains many same words as in the recording, but it is not the answer because the speaker does not compare women and men in terms of who is more influenced by fashion.B is irrelevant so that is not the answer either. The speaker does not mention anything about the choice of clothing of women performers causing any controversy.The speaker mentions that men’s choice are more limited because they have “quite narrow boundaries”, which is similar to “strict code of dress”. Therefore, C is the correct answer. 28. Answer: A. their wish to be taken seriously. Here’s what the speaker says: He points out that a lot of female singers and musicians in popular music tend to dress down in performances, and wear less feminine clothes, like jeans instead of skirts, and he suggests this is because otherwise they’d just be discounted as trivial. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): women = female Explanation: According to Mike’s article, in popular music female singers wear less feminine clothes because “otherwise they’d just be discounted as trivial”. The word “trivial” means “of little value or importance”, so the women singers fear that if they wear feminine clothes then, audiences will focus on their appearance, whereas it is their music which is important. And this is due to the fact that they want to be taken seriously, so A is the correct answer. The other two are irrelevant to the recording. The speaker does not mention copying or anything about masculine styles of clothing. 29. Answer: A. The musicians’ choice of clothing is linked to respect for the audience. Here’s what the speakers say: I was interested by the effect of the audience at a musical performance when it came to the choice of dress. The subjects I interviewed felt this was really important. It’s all to do with what we understand by performance as a public event. They believed the audience had certain expectations and it was up to them as performers to fulfil these expectations, to show a kind of esteem ….. they weren’t afraid of looking as if they’d made an effort to look good. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): respect = esteem Explanation: The subjects wanted to fulfil the expectations of the audience, so it can be inferred that they wanted to earn the affection, the respect of the audience by choosing the right clothing. Thus, A is correct. B and C are not mentioned in the recording. 30. Answer: C. the way clothing may protect against physical injury. Here’s what the speakers say: And I also got interested in what sports scientists are doing too, with regard to clothing. Musicians are quite vulnerable physically, aren’t they, because the movements they carry out are very intensive and repetitive, so I’d imagine some features of sports clothing could safeguard the players from the potentially dangerous effects of this sort of thing. Yes, but musicians don’t really consider it. They avoid clothing that obviously restricts their movements, but that’s as far as they go. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): protect = safeguard injury = dangerous effects Explanation: The recording does mention the link between clothing and the freedom of movement, or physical freedom, though that is not the work of sports scientists but the habit of musicians, because their movements cannot be restricted. Hence A is incorrect. Sports scientists work on clothing that can safeguard, or protect, its users from physical injury that may result from their “very intensive and repetitive” movements, not clothing that can improve their performance. Therefore B is wrong. C is the correct answer. Sports clothing is designed to protect its users from injury through intensive and repetitive actions, which musicians also have to do. SECTION 4 31.

Answer: A won a regional competition earlier this year 7. Answer: birds 8. Answer: flowers 9. Answer: mushrooms 10. Answer: river SECTION 2 11. Answer: C There are not so many bus routes Here’s what the speaker says: Fifty years ago, buses linked virtually every part of the town and the neighbouring towns and villages. Most people used them frequently, but not now, because the bus companies concentrate on just the routes that attract most passengers. So parts of the town are no longer served by buses. Even replacing old uncomfortable buses with smart new ones has had little impact on passenger numbers. It’s sometimes said that bus fares are too high, but in relation to average incomes, fares are not much higher than they were 50 years ago. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): these days = now havegone up = are higher Explanation: The speaker says that “old uncomfortable buses” have been replaced by “smart new ones” so they cannot be the reason for fewer bus users; A is incorrect. We can also confuse the correct answer with B because she says “bus fares are too high”, but then she claims that fares are not too high compared to before, meaning the price has not “gone up” much, due to higher average incomes nowadays. So B is incorrect. The main reason is that buses no longer use various routes, but only those routes which have the most passengers, so the correct answer is C. 12. Answer: B. the development of cycle paths Here’s what the speaker says: The centre was recently closed to traffic on a trial basis, making it much safer for pedestrians. The impact of this is being measured. The new cycle paths, separating bikes from cars in most main roads, are being used far more than was expected, reducing traffic and improving air quality. And although the council’s attempts to have a bypass constructed have failed, we haven’t given up hope of persuading the government to change its mind. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): ban = closed Explanation: A is wrong because “the council’s attempts to have a bypass constructed have failed” therefore a bypass cannot benefit the town at all. The centre being closed to traffic means that cars are banned in the centre, so C seems like the correct answer. However, the speaker says that “The impact of this is being measured” so we cannot say whether it has affected the town yet. The new cycle paths are said to reduce traffic and improve air quality, which is obviously beneficial, so B is the answer. 13. Answer: B. lack of major retailers Here’s what the speaker says: Shopping in the town centre has changed over the years. Many of us can remember when the town was crowded with people going shopping. Numbers have been falling for several years, despite efforts to attract shoppers, for instance by opening new car parks. Some people combine shopping with visits to the town’s restaurants and cafes. Most shops are small independent stores, which is good, but many people prefer to use supermarkets and department stores in nearby large towns, as there are so few well-known chain stores here. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): parking space = car park major = well-known Explanation: According to the recording, new car parks have been opened, so there cannot be “lack of parking spaces”. Thus A is wrong. Furthermore, restaurants and cafes are combined with shopping. So shoppers have the chance to go to restaurants and cafes. Therefore, Cis also wrong. Many shoppers now go to nearby large towns, because there they can find supermarkets and department stores. These are referred to as ‘chain stores’. Well-known chain stores are similar to “major retailers”, so we can infer that the “lack of major retailers” is the problem affecting shopping in town centre. B is the correct answer. 14. Answer: A. There is no hospital. Here’s what the speaker says: Turning now to medical facilities, the town is served by family doctors in several medical practices – fewer than 50 years ago, but each catering for far more patients. Our hospital closed 15 years ago, which means journeys to other towns are unavoidable. On the other hand, there are more dentists than there used to be. Explanation: Shona says that there are fewer medical practices than before, so B is clearly wrong. Also, it is said that “there are more dentists than there used to be” which means that the number of dentists is higher, hence C is incorrect. The hospital closed 15 years ago, and there has not been a new one yet (therefore people have to travel to hospitals in other towns) so the answer must be A. 15. Answer: C. education. Here’s what the speaker says: The number of schools and colleges has increased. making that the main employment sector. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): education = schools and colleges largest = main Explanation: The main employment sector refers to the sector with the largest number of employees, and it has to do with schools and colleges so obviously it is “education”. The answer must be C. 16. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: As you’ll know if you regularly use the car park at the railway station, it’s usually full. The railway company applied for permission to replace it with a multi-storey car park, but that was refused. Instead, the company has bought some adjoining land, and this will be used to increase the number of parking spaces. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (G): expand = increase Explanation: Because the car park at the railway station is usually full, the railway company has to increase parking capacity by either building a new multi-storey car park, or buying more land (“adjoining land” means land around or next to). The multi-storey car park has been refused, and the adjoining land “will be used to increase the number of parking spaces”. This means that there will be more space, or the parking lot will be “expanded”. The correct answer is G. 17. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: The Grand, the old cinema in the high street, will close at the end of the year, and reopen on a different site. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): new = different location = site Explanation: The cinema willopen on a “different site”, which has the same meaning as “new location” so the answer has to be A. 18. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: I expect many of you shop in the indoor market. It’s become more and more shabby-looking, and because of fears about safety, it was threatened with demolition. The good news is that it will close for six weeks to be made safe and redecorated, and the improved building will open in July. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): refurbish = redecorate Explanation: The indoor market will be “redecorated”, or “refurbished”, so the answer must be C. 19. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: The council has managed to secure funding to keep the library open later into the evening, twice a week. Explanation: We need to be careful because the word “manage” in the recording can be confused with “management” in answer F. However, the true meaning of the speaker is that the library will be able to open later at night, that is, opening hours will be extended. Therefore the correct answer is B. 20. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: There’s no limit on access to the nature reserve on the edge of town, and this will continue to be the case. What will change, though, is that the council will no longer be in charge of the area. Instead it will become the responsibility of a national body that administers most nature reserves in the country. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (F): management = a national body that administers Explanation: The speaker says that “There’s no limit on access to the nature reserve on the edge of town, and this will continue to be the case” which means that opening hours will stay the same, so E is incorrect. The change is in the “management” of the facility, that is, another body will be responsible for it, as stated by the speaker. Therefore the answer is F. SECTION 3 21. Answer: cave Here’s what the speakers say: Now, I’m not sure about the drawing of the cave – it’s got trees all around it, which is great, but the drawing’s a bit too static, isn’t it? Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (cave): surrounded by = all around So, the answer is cave. 22. Answer: tiger Here’s what the speakers say: Yes, let’s have Malcolm in the drawing. And what about putting in a tiger – the one he makes friends with a bit later? Maybe it could be sitting under a tree washing itself. And the tiger stops in the middle of what it’s doing when it sees Malcolm walking past. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (tiger): noticing = sees So, the answer is tiger. 23. Answer: dancing Here’s what the speakers say: Then there’s the drawing of the crowd of men and women dancing. They’re just outside the forest, and there’s a lot going on. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (dancing): people = men and women So, the answer is dancing. 24. Answer: crying Here’s what the speakers say: What about having him sitting on the tree trunk on the right of the picture?Yes, that would be fine. And do you want him watching the other people? No, he’s been left out of all the fun, so I’d like him to be crying – that’ll contrast nicely with the next picture… So, the answer is crying. 25. Answer: grass Here’s what the speakers say: And then the drawing of the people ice skating in the forest. I wasn’t too happy with that one. Because they’re supposed to be skating on grass, aren’t they? That’s right, and it’s frozen over. At the moment it doesn’t look quite right. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (grass): covered with ice = frozen So, the answer is grass. 26. Answer: scarf Here’s what the speakers say: And I like the wool hats they’re wearing. Maybe you could give each of them a scarf, as well. So, the answer is scarf. 27. Answer: A Here’s what the speakers say: HELEN: What do you think about including a section on how we planned the project as a whole, Jeremy? That’s probably quite important. JEREMY: Yeah. Well, you’ve had most of the good ideas so far. How do you feel about drafting something, then we can go through it together and discuss it? Explanation: When talking about the section on how they planned the project, Jeremy suggests that Helen does the “drafting”, and then they will discuss that draft together. This means that Helen will write the draft first, so the answer is A. 28. Answer: C Here’s what the speakers say: HELEN: And I could include something on how we came up with the ideas for our two stories, couldn’t I? JEREMY: Well I’ve started writing something about that. so why don’t you do the same and we can include the two things. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): had ideas = came up with ideas Explanation: Jeremy says that he has already started writing about how they “came up with” their ideas. Additionally, he also suggests Helen “do the same” which means BOTH of them will write about it. So the answer is clearly C. 29. Answer: D Here’s what the speakers say: HELEN: Right. So what about our interpretation of the stories? Do we need to write about what we think they show, like the value of helping other people, all that sort of thing? JEREMY: That’s going to come up later, isn’t it? I think everyone in the class is going to read each other’s stories and come up with their own interpretations, which we’re going to discuss. HELEN: Oh, I missed that. So it isn’t going to be part of the report at all?JEREMY: No Explanation: At first, Helen wonders if they should write about the interpretation of their stories but Jeremy thinks that “everyone in the class will come up with their own interpretations”. Eventually both of them decide not to include it in their report, which means that none of them will write that part. The answer is D. 30. Answer: B Here’s what the speakers say: JEREMY: But we need to write about the illustrations, because they’re an essential element of children’s experience of reading the stories. It’s probably easiest for you to write that section, as you know more about drawing than I do. HELEN: Maybe, but I find it quite hard to write about. I’d be happier if you did it.JEREMY: OK. Explanation: This question is really tricky because the speakers change their mind. Initially Jeremy suggests Helen write the section about illustrations, so you might think Helen will do it. But later Helen says “I’d be happier if you did it” and Jeremy says OK, which means he agrees to do the writing for her. The person who will write about illustrations is Jeremy, therefore the answer is B. SECTION 4 31. Answer: attitudes Here’s what the speaker says: Well, businesses are finding that ethnography can offer them deeper insight into the possible needs of customer, either present or future, as well as providing valuable information about their attitudes towards existing products. Explanation: the speaker says that business find ethnography useful in order to investigate customer needs and to learn what customers think about existing products. Ethnography ‘provides valuable information about’ customer attitudes. The answer is attitudes. 32. Answer: numbers Here’s what the speaker says: One team of researchers did a project for a company manufacturing kitchen equipment. They watched how cooks used measuring cups to measure out things like sugar and flour. They saw that the cooks had to check and recheck the contents, because although the measuring cups had numbers inside them, the cooks couldn’t see these easily. Explanation: the first example of how ethnographic research has been used in business is the example of the measuring cups. Cooks found these difficult to use and had to check the correct amounts measured. This was because the numbers inside the cups were difficult to see. The answer is numbers. 33. Answer: time Here’s what the speaker says: Another team of ethnographic researchers looked at how cell phones were used in Uganda. They found that people who didn’t have their own phones could pay to use the phones of local entrepreneurs. Because these customers paid in advance for their calls, they were eager to know how much time they’d spent on the call so far. So the phone company designed phones for use globally with this added feature. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (time): wanted = were eager used = spent Explanation: the second example of ethnographic research in business is cell phones. The speaker explains that in Uganda, many people used the cell phones of local entrepreneurs (business people), paying for the calls in advance. So, they needed to know how much time they had spent on their call. The answer is time. 34. Answer: software Here’s what the speaker says: In one company, IT systems administrators were observed for several weeks. It was found that a large amount of their work involved communicating with colleagues in order to solve problems, but that they didn’t have a standard way of exchanging information from spreadsheets and so on. So the team came up with an idea for software that would help them to do this. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (software): develop = came up with an idea Explanation: the ethnographic researchers in computer companies looked at the difficulties of communication (exchanging information) between system administrators and their colleagues. It was necessary to introduce/develop software that would facilitate this. The answer is software. 35. Answer: patients Here’s what the speaker says: In another piece of research, a team observed and talked to nurses working in hospitals. This led to the recognition that the nurses needed to access the computer records of their patients, no matter where they were. This led to the development of a portable computer tablet that allowed the nurses to check records in locations throughout the hospital. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (patients): information = records different parts = throughout Explanation: in the context of hospitals, a portable computer tablet was developed to enable nurses to check the computer records (to enable nurses to access information) about patients. The answer is patients. 36. Answer: emotions/feelings Here’s what the speaker says: For example, in one project done for an airline, respondents used their smartphones to record information about airline trips, in a study aiming at tracking the emotions of passengers during a flight. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (emotions): while travelling = during a flight Explanation: the researchers were not present during this study, because the passengers (the respondents) were flying. Instead, the respondents recorded how they felt (their emotions) on their smartphones. The answer is emotions/feelings. 37. Answer: income Here’s what the speaker says: As far as choosing the participants themselves is concerned, that’s not really all that different from ordinary research – the criteria according to which the participants are chosen may be something as simple as the age bracket they fall into, or the researchers may select them according to their income, or they might try to find a set of people who all use a particular product, for example. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (income): by = according to Explanation: now the speaker is talking about the criteria for choosing the people who take part in the research. First, age is mentioned as one possible criteria, and then the speaker mentions a second possibility – income. The answer is income. 38. Answer: comfortable Here’s what the speaker says: But it’s absolutely crucial to recruit the right people as participants. As well as the criteria I’ve mentioned, they have to be comfortable talking about themselves and being watched as they go about their activities. Explanation: participants have to/must be prepared to talk about themselves and feel comfortable about somebody watching them ‘as they go about their activities’. These things mean ‘taking part in the research’, so the answer is comfortable. 39. Answer: observation Here’s what the speaker says: So what makes this type of research special is that it’s not just a matter of sending a questionnaire to the participants, insteadthe research is usually based on first-hand observation of what they are doing at the time. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (observation): direct = first-hand Explanation: ethnographic research is different in some ways from traditional types of research. It is special because it is usually done by the researcher directly observing the participants, to see what they are doing at any particular time. The answer is observation. 40. Answer: analysis Here’s what the speaker says: Most researchers estimate that 70 to 80 per cent of their time is spent not on the collecting of data but on its analysis – looking at photos, listening to recordings and transcribing them, and so on. Explanation: researchers calculate (estimate) that 70 to 80 per cent (=most of) their time is spent not on collecting data, but on analysing the data. So, the answer is analysis.",

Answer: 4.30 (pm)/ half past four 10. Answer: 07788136711 SECTION 2 11-12. Answer: A. Some rooms now have a different use., B. A different type of seating has been installed. Here’s what the speaker says: We try hard to involve members of the public in the theatre. One way is by organizing backstage tours, so people can be shown round the building and learn how a theatre operates. These are proving very popular.What we’re finding is that people want to have lunch or a cup of coffee while they’re here, so we’re looking into the possibility of opening a cafe in due course. We have a bookshop, which specialises in books about drama, and that attracts plenty of customers. Then there are two large rooms that will be decorated next month, and they’ll be available for hire, for conferences and private functions, such as parties. We’re also considering hiring out costumes to amateur drama clubs. Explanation: Remember that you are asked what facilities are currently offered to the public. Rooms for hire “will be decorated next month” so they are not yet open, thus A is incorrect. Likewise, the speaker says they are “considering” hiring out costumes and “looking into” opening a café in the future, indicating that the two services are not yet available. Hence C and E are incorrect. Backstage tours “are proving very popular” meaning they are already in operation. In addition, they have a bookshop therefore “backstage tours” and “bookshop” are currently offered to the public. B and D are the correct answers. 13-14 Answer: B. backstage tours , D. a bookshop Here’s what the speaker says: …we’re carrying out a major refurbishment at the moment. The interior has just been repainted, and we’re about to start on the exterior of the building – that’ll be a big job. The work’s running over budget, so we’ve had to postpone installing an elevator. I hope you’re happy running up and down stairs! When the theatre was built, people were generally slimmer and shorter than now, and the seats were very close together. We’ve replaced them with larger seats, with more legroom. This means fewer seats in total, but we’ve taken the opportunity to install seats that can easily be moved, to create different acting spaces. We’ve also turned a few storerooms over to other purposes, like using them for meetings. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (A B): outside = exterior different = other use = purpose Explanation: An elevator has not yet been installed, because there is not enough money – the cost of refurbishment (modernisation) is ‘running over budget’. So that job has not been done. C is not correct. Work on the outside – the exterior – of the building has not started. It is ‘about to start’, so D is not correct. There will be fewer seats in total, not extra seats, so E is not correct. Old seats have been replaced with new, larger ones, indicating that “A different type of seating has been installed” so Bis correct. The speaker also mentions that some storerooms are now used for other “purposes”, which has the same meaning as “use”, so Ais also correct. You need to pay attention to the question asking about changes that HAVE BEEN made, not will be made in the future, thus the exterior and the elevator is irrelevant. The correct answers are A and B. 15-16. Answer: C. making puppets, E. lighting Here’s what the speaker says: Now I want to tell you about our workshops. We recently started a programme of workshops that anyone can join. Eventually we intend to run courses in acting, but we’re waiting until we’ve got the right people in place as trainers. That’s proving more difficult than we’d expected! There’s a big demand to learn about the technical side of putting on a production, and our lighting workshop has already started, with great success. We’re going to start one on sound next month. A number of people have enquired about workshops on make-up, and that’s something we’re considering for the future. A surprise success is the workshop on making puppets – we happen to have someone working here who does it as a hobby, and she offered to run a workshop, it was so popular we’re now running them every month! Explanation: In the same way as for questions 13 and 14, you are asked what workshops are CURRENTLY offered by the theatre. The speaker says that they want to open one in acting but are waiting for the right trainers, so that is not open yet. The theatre will start a workshop about sound next month and they are also considering one for make-up, which means these two are not available at the moment either. Thus, A, B and D are not correct, because they refer to future possibilities. The speaker mentions that lighting and making puppets workshops are really “popular” with “great success” so C and E are the correct answers. 17. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: Standing here in the foyer, you’re probably wondering why the box office isn’t here, where the public would expect to find it. Well, you might have noticed it on your way in – although it’s part of this building, it’s next door, with a separate entrance from the road. The separate entrance from the road is letter G. G is correct. 18. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: For the theatre manager’s office, you go across the foyer and through the double doors, turn right, and it’s the room at the end of the corridor, with the door on the left. Follow these instructions on the plan, and you will find the correct answer, D. 19. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: The lighting box is where the computerised stage lighting is operated, and it’s at the back of the building. When you’re through the double doors, turn left, turn right at the water cooler, and right again at the end. It’s the second room along that corridor. Following these instructions on the plan, we locate the correct answer, B. 20. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: The artistic director’s office is through the double doors, turn right, and it’s the first room you come to on the right-hand side. And finally, for the moment the room where I’ll take you next – the relaxation room. Follow these instructions on the plan, we locate the correct answer, F. SECTION 3 21. Answer: A. factors affecting where organisms live Here’s what the speaker says: -But we need something about what causes different organisms to choose particular habitats. -I agree. And something about finding out how to protect organisms in danger of dying out? -In our aims? But we weren’t really looking at that. -I suppose not. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): affect = cause where organisms live = habitats Explanation: One speaker does talk about the protection of endangered species (“protect organisms in danger of dying out”) but she is talking about the solution, not the aim, to preserve them. Furthermore, the other speaker does not agree, so B is not correct. C is irrelevant because there is no mention made of “classifying different organisms”. What the speakers both agree to include in their aims is “what causes different organisms to choose particular habitats”. The meaning of “cause” is similar to “factors affecting” and “habitats” refers to where something lives, thus it can be understood that the students want to find out what affects where organisms live. Hence, A is the correct answer. 22. Answer: A. string Here’s what the speaker says: -What did they tell us to bring a ruler for? -It was something about measuring the slope of the shore, but of course we didn’t need it because we were measuring wind direction, and we’d brought the compass for that… -But not the piece of string to hold up in the air! Didn’t Mr Blake make a fuss about us leaving that behind. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): forget to take = leave behind Explanation: With regard to the ruler, one speaker says that they did not need it, but we can understand that they DID bring the ruler although it was not really useful.So C is incorrect. In addition, they brought the compass to measure wind direction, so they definitely did not forget the compass at home. Therefore, B is also incorrect. However, they were scolded by Mr. Blake because they left “the piece of string to hold up in the air” behind, so “string” isthe answer. A is correct. 23. Answer: C. the amount of information provided. Here’s what the speaker says: -Now, the next section’s the procedure. I sent you the draft of that. -Yeah. It was clear, but I don’t think we need all these details of what time we left and what time we got back and how we divided up the different research tasks. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): information = details Explanation: This conversation is really tricky because it can confuse you. If you do not listen carefully, the time they left and the time they got back can be mistaken as “the order of information”. And the word “divided” appears in both the recording and answer B but it turns out to be wrong. What Colin really suggests is that they leave out some unnecessary information when he says ‘I don’t think we need all these details…..’ Therefore C is the correct answer. 24. Answer: B. It was simple to carry out. Here’s what the speaker says: -So let’s begin with how we measured wave speed. I was surprised how straightforward that was. -I’d expected us to have some sort of high-tech device, not just stand there and count the number of waves per minute.Not very precise, but I suppose it was good enough. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): the method = how accurate = precise simple = straightforward equipment = device Explanation: The speaker says that they “expected” to have some “high-tech device”, which can be understood as “special equipment”, meaning that they did not actually use it, so C is not correct. In addition, their method was “not very precise” so the results CANNOT be accurate, thus A is wrong. In fact, they “just stand there and count the number of waves per minute” so their method is quite simple. B is the correct answer. 25. Answer: B. She stood in the wrong place. Here’s what the speaker says: And I had to do it while the tide was low, well that was OK, but the place I started it from was down on the beach, then I realised I should have gone up higher to get better visibility,so I had to start all over again. But at least I’d got the squared paper or I’d have had problems drawing it all to scale. Explanation: Helen says that she had to draw the map while the tide was low and “that was OK” which means that the time was not wrong, so C is incorrect. Additionally, she got the squared paper to draw the map, otherwise she would have had trouble “drawing it all to scale”. We can infer from this that the paper she had helped her to draw the map correctly scaled, thus A is also wrong. The actual problem was the place where she stood at, and she wished she had “gone up higher to get better visibility”, which is her mistake. Therefore the answer is B. 26. Answer: B. check it using photographs Here’s what the speaker says: -We could get a map of the region off the internet and see if we need to make any changes. -I had a look but I couldn’t find anything. But you took some pictures, didn’t you? -Yeah. I’ll email you them if you want. -OK.I’ll make my amendments using those, then I can scan it into our report. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): check = make amendments photograph = picture Explanation: You should be careful with answers with the exact same words as the recording. Colin suggests checking the “internet” for a map but Helen could not find anything, so C is incorrect. A is also wrong because the students will scan the map into their report, NOT “onto a computer”. They agree to make some “amendments” to the map they drew using the pictures, or photographs, that they have taken. It can be understood that they will “check” their map and compare it to the photos to make some change if necessary. Therefore, B is the correct answer. 27-28. Answer: A. lack of water, D. high temperatures Here’s what the speaker says about the shellfish in the ‘splash zone’: -But the shells prevent them from drying out because they’re in the open air for most of the time. -Right. And since they’re exposed, they need to be able to find some sort of shelter, or cover themselves up, so they don’t get too hot. Then in the middle and lower zones, nearer the sea, we need to discuss the effects of wave action… Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (A D): lack of water = drying out high temperatures = hot Explanation: One speaker says that “the shells prevent them from drying out because they’re in the open air for most of the time”. Because organisms can dry out if they do not have enough water in their body, it can be inferred that they may face a problem of lacking water. So A is correct. In addition, the shells also protect the organisms from getting “too hot”, which means that the splash zone is really high in temperature, thus D is correct. The other answers including winds, food and large waves are not mentioned as a threat to splash zone organisms, thus irrelevant. The correct answers are A and D. 29-30.Answer: C. incorrect identification of some organisms, E. missing some organisms when counting Here’s what the speaker says: – Right. OK, now I did a draft of the section of sources of possible error in our research, but I don’t know if you agree. For example, the size of the sample, and whether it’s big enough to make any general conclusions from. But I thought actually we did have quite a big sample. – We did. And our general method of observation seemed quite reliable. But we might not be all that accurate as far as the actual numbers go. -Yeah, we might have missed some organisms – if they were hiding under a rock, for example. I wasn’t sure about the way we described their habitats. I decided it was probably OK. – Yeah, and the descriptions we gave of the smaller organisms, they weren’t very detailed, but they were adequate in this context. I’m not sure we identified all the species correctly though. – OK, we’d better mention that. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (C E): generalization = general conclusion Explanation: The students fear that “generalizations” or “general conclusions” could not be drawn out from small samples, but they agree that they have quite a big sample, so generalization is not a problem for them, thus D is wrong. Concerning the habitats, they think their work was OK, so A is also wrong. There is no mention made of the relation between the behavior of organisms and the observer, hence B is irrelevant. On the other hand, the students think that they could have missed some organisms when they counted the numbers, which proves that E is correct. And one speaker says “I’m not sure we identified all the species correctly” so a possible error could be “incorrect identification of some organisms”, or C. So we have C and E as the correct answers.

Answer: animal/animals Here’s what the speaker says: I must give you some advice and safety tips before we go any further. As it’s a working farm, please don’t frighten or injure the animals. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (animals): harm = injure Explanation: the speaker welcomes visitors, giving advice about what to do. The first thing is not to injure (harm) the animals. So, the answer is animal/animals. (We can sometimes use a singular or plural noun after ‘any’) 12. Answer: tool/tools Here’s what the speaker says: And do stay at a safe distance from the tools: some of them have sharp points which can be pretty dangerous, so please don’t touch them. Explanation: visitors are warned not to go near the tools – to stay at a safe distance from them. Then, they are warned not to touch the tools. The answer is tool/tools. 13. Answer: shoes Here’s what the speaker says: I’m glad to see you’re all wearing shoes – we always advise people to do that. Explanation: because the ground is uneven and visitors may slip, they should wear shoes. The answer is shoes. 14. Answer: dogs Here’s what the speaker says: I don’t think any of you have brought dogs with you, but in case you have, I’m afraid they’ll have to stay in the car park, unless they’re guide dogs. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (dogs): certain exceptions = unless Explanation: The speaker tells visitors not to bring dogs into the farm, but dogs which accompany blind people (guide dogs) are allowed. These are the ‘exceptions’ to the rule. The answer is dog/dogs. 15. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: Now let me give you some idea of the layout of the farm…….The scarecrow you can see in the car park in the corner , beside the main path, is the traditional figure for keeping the birds away from the crops… Explanation: It is important to notice the ‘X’ – You are here on the map. Use this to follow the instructions about where to go. So, we look for the scarecrow in the corner of the car park, at the side of (beside) the main path. This gives us the answer F. 16. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: If you look ahead of you, you’ll see a maze. It’s opposite the New Barn, beside the side path that branches off to the right just over there. The maze is made out of hedges which are too tall for young children to see over them, but it’s quite small, so you can’t get lost in it! Explanation: there are only 2 possible letters opposite the New Barn (I and G). However, the speaker says that the maze is ‘beside the side path’ to the right. So, the answer is G. 17. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: Now, can you see the bridge crossing the fish pool further up the main path? If you want to go to the café, go towards the bridge and turn right just before it. Walk along the side path and the café’s on the first bend you come to. Explanation: the bridge crosses the fish pool, which is marked on the map. Just before you arrive at this bridge, turn right. This is marked as the ‘side path’. The building at the first bend is the café, so the answer is D. 18. Answer: H Here’s what the speaker says: As you may know, we run skill workshops here, where you can learn traditional crafts like woodwork and basket-making. You can see examples of the work, and talk to someone about the courses, in the Black Barn. If you take the side path to the right here, just by the New Barn, you’ll come to the Black Barn just where the path first bends. Explanation: to visit the Black Barn, take the side path to the right of the New Barn. Where the path bends is the Black Barn, so the answer is H. 19. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: You can picnic in the field, though do clear up behind you, of course. Or, if you’d prefer a covered picnic area, there’s one near the farmyard: just after you cross the bridge, there’s a covered picnic spot on the right. Explanation: the covered picnic area is just after you cross the bridge. We know that it is near the farmyard, and it is also on the right, (the answer cannot be B, which is on the left, and is part of the farmyard), so the answer is C. 20. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: And the last thing to mention is Fiddy House itself. From here you can cross the bridge then walk along the footpath through the field to the left of the farmyard. That goes to the house. Explanation: crossing the bridge, we take the footpath to the left of the farmyard. We can see that this goes in the direction of the road, and letter A. The answer is A. SECTION 3 21. Answer: C science, technology, engineering or mathematics. Here’s what the speaker says: About the study of college students done by Akira Miyake and his team? Yeah. I was interested that the researchers were actually a mix of psychologists and physicists. That’s an unusual combination.- Yeah. I got a little confused at first about which students the study was based on. They weren’t actually majoring in physics – they were majoring in what’sknown as the STEM disciplines. That’s science, technology, engineering and …- … and math. Yes, but they were all doing physics courses as part of their studies. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C):major in physics = physicistmajor in psychology = psychologistmathematics = math Explanation: Answer B seems appropriate at first because “the researchers were actually a mix of psychologists and physicists”. However, the question does not ask about the people carrying out the research but about “the students in Akira Miyake’s study”. Therefore B is not correct. It is also said that “They weren’t actually majoring in physics” (“they” refers to the students which the study was based on) so A is not correct either. They were actually majoring in STEM disciplines, including science, technology, engineering and mathematics (or math). Hence C is the correct answer. 22. Answer: B a way of improving women’s performance in physics. Here’s what the speaker says: That’s correct. So as I understood it, Miyake and co started from the fact that women are underrepresented in introductory physics courses at college, and also that on average, the women who do enrol on these courses perform more poorly than the men. No one really knows why this is the case.-Yeah. But what the researchers wanted to find out was basically what they could do about the relatively low level of the women’s results. But in order to find a solution they needed to find out more about the nature of the problem. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): aim = want to investigate = find out performance = results Explanation: The above conversation is about women who study physics at college, but no mention is made of the different kinds of women, therefore A is irrelevant. In addition, Miyake’s study compared the results, NOT the number, of women and men attending physics class: “the women who do enrol on these courses perform more poorly than the men” so C is also incorrect. The speaker says that Miyake’s team “wanted to find out”, which means they aimed to “investigate”, a solution to the problem of the poor results of women in physics. So, we understand that they want to “improve” such poor “performance”, hence B is the correct answer. 23. Answer: B. the male students expected them to do badly. Here’s what the speaker says: Right – now let’s see if I can remember… it was that in the physics class, the female students thought the male students all assumed that women weren’t any good at physics … was that it? And they thought that the men expected them to get poor results in their tests.-That’s what the women thought, and that made them nervous, so they did get poor results. But actually they were wrong … No one was making any assumptions about the female students at all. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): females = women believe = thought male students = men do badly = get poor results expect = assume = make assumptions Explanation: The entire dialogue does not mention anything related to teachers, so A is obviously irrelevant. We need to be careful when the speaker says “That’s what the women thought, and that made them nervous, so they did get poor results”. So C: “their test results were lower than the male students’ ” is the consequence of what the females thought, but it does not describe what the women were thinking or believing, hence C does not answer the question. As the speaker says “No one was making any assumptions about the female students at all”, we can understand that men did not “assume”, which is similar to “expect”, the women to do badly, meaning the women were wrong to think that way. The answer is B. 24. Answer: C. something that was important to them personally. Here’s what the speaker says: Anyway, what Miyake’s team did was quite simple – getting the students to do some writing before they went into the physics class. What did they call it?-Values-affirmation – they had to write an essay focusing on things that were significant to them, not particularly to do with the subject they were studying, but more general things like music, or people who mattered to them. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): ​​​​​​​asksb to do = get sb to doimportant = significant = mattered to Explanation: It is said that Miyake asked the students to write an essay “on things that were significant to them, not particularly to do with the subject they were studying”. Even though “significant” things can refer to the things they enjoyed, we can clearly see that the essay is not related to studying physics, so A is not correct. B is not the answer because the conversation does not mention anything about others’ experiences. Meanwhile, “significant” is the same as “important”, and the speaker gives examples of the essay topics like “music, or people who mattered to them”, implying that the students should write about their personal life. If something ‘matters to you’, it is important to you. Therefore the most appropriate answer is C. 25. Answer: A. to reduce stress Here’s what the speaker says: Right. So the idea of doing the writing is that this gets the students thinking in a positive way.-And putting these thoughts into words can relax them and help them overcome the psychological factors that lead to poor performance. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): writing exercise = doing the writingaim = ideareduce stress = relax Explanation: It is clear that “verbal ability” is not mentioned and C cannot be the answer. One of the speaker says that the idea behind, or the “aim”, of Miyake’s exercise is to encourage positive thinking, not logical thinking. Therefore C is incorrect. Beside positive thinking, the writing exercise also helps the students with relaxing, not physically but psychologically (“help them overcome the psychological factors”).We can deduce from this that the exercise helps them to “reduce stress”, because stress is a psychological factor that can affect the performance of students. The answer is A. 26. Answer: B. the positive impact it had on physics results for women Here’s what the speaker says: But what the researchers in the study hadn’t expected was that this one activity raised the women’s physics grades from the C to the B range. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): ​​​​​​​surprised = hadn’t expected Explanation: It was to the researchers’ surprise, because they “hadn’t expected”, that their study might improve the grades of women, from C to B range in particular. This is obviously a positive change, so the answer has to be B. 27. Answer: C. the information the students were given. Here’s what the speaker says: Yes. Mind you, Miyake’s article left out a lot of details. Like, did the students do the writing just once, or several times? And had they been told why they were doing the writing? That might have affected the results.- You mean, if they know the researchers thought it might help them to improve, then they’d just try to fulfil that expectation? Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C):the writing task = the writinggiven information = told Explanation: The question of one speaker: “did the students do the writing just once, or several times” may trick you into thinking about “the length of the writing task”. However, it is not mentioned whether this may affect the results of the study. Also the number of times that students do the writing task does not refer to the length of the task. Therefore, A is not correct.There is no mention of the number of students who took part in the writing task, so B is also incorrect.Right after that, the speaker says that if the women students knew why they had to write the essay, “That might have affected the results”. Whether or not had they been told about the reason for writing the task can be understood as “the information the students were given”, hence C is correct. 28. Answer: A. two different writing tasks. Here’s what the speaker says: Explanation: We need to be careful when Greg says “oral task”, which appears in B and C. At first, Greg suggests a combination of a writing task and an oral task, so we might think the answer is B. However, later on both Greg and Lisa decide to go with two different kinds of writing tasks to see “if it really is the topic that made the difference, or something else”. This means that they want to know which topic or which task might affect the results of the study, so it is the same as “compare the effects” of the two different writing tasks. A is the only answer which refers to two different writing tasks. Therefore the answer is A. 29. Answer: B. had no effect on the performance of men or women. Here’s what the speaker says: And there was another article I read, by Smolinsky. It was about her research on how women and men perform in mixed teams in class, compared with single-sex teams and on their own.-Let me guess … the women were better at teamwork.-That’s what I expected, but actually the men and the women got the same results whether they were working in teams or on their own. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): no effect = the same resultsteamwork activities = working in teamsperformance = results Explanation: At first, we can hear Greg’s guess about women being better at teamwork, which has the same meaning as A. However, A is not the answer because consequently Lisa reveals the fact that “the men and the women got the same results whether they were working in teams or on their own”. The “same results” means that teamwork “has no effect” on the performance of the men and women, so C is incorrect.Working in teams or on their own, men and women got the same results – class teamwork did not affect the results and therefore B is correct. 30. Answer: A. talk to a professor Here’s what the speaker says: Right, what do we need to do next? We could have a look at the timetable for the science classes … or perhaps we should just make an appointment to seeone of the science professors. That’d be better.-Great. And we could even get to observe one of the classes.-What for?-Well … OK maybe let’s just go with your idea. Right, well … Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): ​​​​​​​talk to = make an appointment to see Explanation: When discussing about what they should do next, Lisa initially suggests looking at the timetable for science classes, which is answer C. However, if we listen carefully, Lisa then proposes a better idea of making an appointment with a professor. To “make an appointment” means that they will see the professor to talk about their project, so that is answer A. The next part is tricky because Greg also makes a suggestion about observing a science class, so we might think that the answer is C. So, we have to read the next line. But in the end, both of them agree to go with Lisa’s idea which is seeing a professor and the correct answer is A. SECTION 4 31. Answer: conservastion Here’s what the speaker says: About 20 years ago biologists developed the idea of what they called ‘biodiversity hotspots’. These are the areas which have the greatest mixture of species, so one example is Madagascar. These hotspots are significant because they allow us to locate key areas for focusing efforts at conservation. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (conservation) important = significant targets = key areas Explanation: the speaker talks about ‘biodiversity hotspots’, and explains what they are. They are important in order to locate the areas in which to ‘focus’ (target) conservation. The answer is conservation. 32. Answer: food Here’s what the speaker says: Then a Canadian biologist called Boris Worm did some research in 2005 on data on ocean species that he got from the fishing industry. Worm located five hotspots for large ocean predators like sharks, and looked at what they had in common. The main thing he’d expected to find was that they had very high concentrations of food, but to his surprise that was only true for four of the hotspots – the remaining hotspot was quite badly off in that regard. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (food): rich in = had high concentrations of Explanation: Boris Worm discovered five ocean hotspots for predators like sharks. He expected that these hotspots would all have a lot of food for sharks, but one of these five hotspots did not have much food for large predators. What he expected to find was only true for four of the hotspots, so it was not always true that ocean hotspots had a large food supply for sharks. The answer is food. 33. Answer: surface Here’s what the speaker says: But what he did find was that in all cases, the water at the surface of the ocean had relatively high temperatures, even when it was cool at greater depths. Explanation: In these hotspots, the deep water could be cool, but at the surface, the temperature of the water was high when compared with this deeper water. The answer is surface. 34. Answer: oxygen Here’s what the speaker says: However, this wasn’t enough on its own, because he also found that the water needed to have enough oxygen in it – so these two factors seemed necessary to support the high metabolic rate of these large fish. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (oxygen): sufficient = enough Explanation: Boris Worm also found that in hotspots, large ocean predators also needed water that contained sufficient oxygen. This enabled them to be very active (their high metabolic rate). The answer is oxygen. 35. Answer: mammals Here’s what the speaker says: A couple of years later, in 2007, a researcher called Lisa Ballance, who was working in California, also started looking for ocean hotspots, but not for fish – what she was interested in was marine mammals, things like seals. Explanation: Lisa Ballance was also interested in ocean hotspots, but her interest was not in the fish, but in the marine mammals which lived there. The answer is mammals. 36. Answer: ice Here’s what the speaker says: For example, there’s an international project called the Census of Marine Life. They’ve been surveying oceans all over the world, including the Arctic. One thing they’ve found there which stunned other researchers was that there were large numbers of species which live below the ice….. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (ice): ​​​​​​​under = below Explanation: the Census of Marine Life discovered many new species while surveying the Arctic. Lots of these new species were found under the ice. So, the answer is ice. 37. Answer: decline/decrease Here’s what the speaker says: So a body called the Global Marine Species Assessment ….consider things like the size of the population – how many members of one species there are in a particular place – and then they look at their distribution in geographical terms, although this is quite difficult when you’re looking at fish, because they’re so mobile, and then thirdly they calculate the rate at which the decline of the species is happening. Explanation: when they make their list of endangered species, the Global Marine Species Marine Assessment want to consider numbers (population size), geographical distribution and, thirdly how fast this decline of these species is taking place (the rate of decline). So, the answer is decline/decrease. 38. Answer: map Here’s what the speaker says: So far only 1,500 species have been assessed, but they want to increase this figure to 20,000. For each one they assess, they use the data they collect on that species to produce a map showing its distribution. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (map): aim = they want to make = produce Explanation: the speaker says that for each one of the species assessed, the aim is to show their distribution (where it can be found geographically), so a distribution map will be made for each species assessed. The answer is map. 39. Answer: migration Here’s what the speaker says: In addition, to preserve species such as leatherback turtles, which live out in the high seas, but have their nesting sites on the American coast, we need to create corridors for migration, so they can get from one area to another safely. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (migration): establish = create Explanation: the final part of the talk is about recommendations – what can be done to retain the diversity of species in the oceans. One of these recommendations concerns species which migrate – giving the example of turtles. For such species, the proposal is to establish corridors so that they can migrate safely to their breeding (nesting sites). The answer is migration. 40. Answer: comsumption Here’s what the speaker says: And finally, there’s the problem of the ‘by-catch’. This refers to the catching of unwanted fish by fishing boats – they’re returned to the sea, but they’re often dead or dying. If these commercial fishing boats used equipment which was more selective, so that only the fish wanted for consumption were caught, this problem could be overcome. Here are some key words to help you to get the answer (consumption): for the purpose of = wanted for Explanation: the final recommendation concerns commercial fishing. Better equipment could reduce the ‘by-catch’, so that only those fish wanted for consumption would be caught. The answer is consumption.",

Here’s what the speaker says: It’s an international design competition and we will have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic kitchen appliance. I see, and are there any special conditions? Does it have to save energy for example? Actually it was the focus in last year’s competition. This year is different. We have to adopt an innovative approach to existing technology, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): develop = adopt a new use = an innovative approach….using it (existing technology) in a way that hasn’t been thought of before. current = existing Explanation: Answers A and B contain key words “energy-efficient” and “energy-saving” that can confuse students, because they have the same meaning as “save energy” in the script. However, “it has to save energy” was the focus in last year’s competition. This year, the design competition is different. Therefore, A is not correct. We have to pay attention to the answer right after ‘it has to save energy’ to see if it is true or not. It is a common trick in Listening tests. Answer B is not correct because this also refers to ‘energy-saving’, but we know now that this is NOT the focus of the design competition this year. In addition, answer B contains exactly the same words as the script (existing, appliance). Be careful with this kind of answer. A small difference in the words used can change the meaning completely, hence it turns out to be the wrong answer. 22. Answer: A. more appealing. Here’s what the speaker says: Interesting, what made you choose that? Well, they’re an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses but they are all pretty boring and almost identical to each other. I think some people will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): more appealing = look different common = everyday Explanation: John states that most Australian houses have dishwashers – that’s what he means when he says that ‘they’re an everyday kitchenappliance’. So, he does not want to make them more common – Answer B is NOTcorrect. After that, he believes people will “pay a little extra”, which means the price will be a little higher, so it can’t be “economical” (which means saving money). Therefore, C is NOT the answer. John hopes people will buy his product because it is something that ‘looks different’, which means they are attracted to it, or they find it appealing. A is the answer. 23. Answer: B. to switch it on. Here’s what the speaker says: I see you’ve called your design “the Rockpool”. Why is that? Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach. The top is made of glass so you can look down into it. And there’s a stone at the bottom. Is that just for decoration? Actually it does have a function. Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): to be used = have a function switch it on = push a button Explanation: We pay attention from the time when the speakers mention “the Rockpool”. One of them mentions the stone and asks if that is just for decoration. “Just” means the stone is only used for decoration and does not have any other purpose. But this is a question, so we have to listen to the answer. John claims it does have a function, which means it will be used for a particular purpose. Therefore, A is NOTthe answer. There is no mention of ‘water escaping’, so Answer C is NOT correct. “Pushing a button” is what you do to switch a machine on. John states that with this rockpool, you don’t push a button, ‘you turn the stone’. Hence, turning the stone has the same function as pushing a button, which is to switch the rockpool on. The answer is B. 24. Answer: A. changes back to a gas. Here’s what the speaker says To allow them to dry, the liquid carbon dioxide and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding chamber. That’s where the liquid is depressurized and so it reverts to a gas. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): change back= revert Explanation: At first, the speaker mentions “to dry”, however, it is notthe carbon dioxide itself but the whole process that does that function of drying the dishes. The speaker mentions both the liquid carbon dioxide and the waster materials in the holding chamber, and then explains what will happen in that chamber. Therefore, B is NOT correct. It CANNOT be Answer C, because we know that the liquid is ‘depressurised’ = it loses pressure, but no mention is made of the temperature of the liquid. He uses “theliquid” to refer to “the liquid carbon dioxide”, making it hard for students to understand immediately, hence they are not able to find the answer. “Revert” means “change back”. The answer is A. 25. Answer: C. is collected ready to be re-used. Here’s what the speaker says What happens to the carbon dioxide once the process is complete? Not wasted I hope. Actually, that’s where the real savings are made. The carbon dioxide is sent back to the cylinder and can be used again and again. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): at the end of the cleaning process = once the process is complete re-used = used again and again Explanation: We pay attention when one of the speakers asks about what happens to the carbon dioxide once the process is complete, which means at the end of the process. John states “real savings are made”, which means it is not wasted, such as being released to the air or being disposed of. Therefore, A and B are NOT the answer. John says that it will be sent back, which we can understand as being collected at the cylinder, then ‘used again and again’, which means “re-used”. The answer is C. 26. Answer: presentation 27. Answer: model 28. Answer: material / materials 29. Answer: grant 30. Answer: technical SECTION 4 31. Answer: gene Here’s what the speaker says: One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the result of a special gene that surfaces in a few. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (gene): comes from = the result of uncommon = special Explanation: we are told that the white colour of the coat of a few bears comes from an unusual gene. The answer is gene. 32. Answer: power / powers Here’s what the speaker says: Local people have named it ‘the spirit bear’. And according to the legends of these communities, its snowy fur brings with it a special power. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (power/powers): believe = legends unusual = special Explanation: local people have a legend that this white (snowy) colour of the fur has an unusual power. The answer is power / powers. 33. Answer: strangers Here’s what the speaker says: Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them – so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else. It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area. Explanation: so, the local people do not talk about the bear to strangers, in order to help to protect it. The answer is strangers. 34. Answer: erosion Here’s what the speaker says: The white bear’s habitat is quite interesting. The bear’s strong relationship with the old-growth rainforest is a complex one. The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways. For example, the old-growth trees have extremely long roots that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams. Keeping these banks intact is important because these streams are home to salmon….. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (erosion): stop = prevent Explanation: the long roots of the old trees prevent the soil from falling into the rivers (streams), maintaining the habitat of the salmon. The process when soil falls into rivers is called ‘erosion’. The answer is erosion. 35. Answer: islands Here’s what the speaker says: Today the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (islands): currently = today a small number = a few Explanation: we learn that the white bear ‘is found’ (‘lives’) on a few islands. The answer is islands. 36. Answer: roads Here’s what the speaker says: The greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat. Over many years, logging companies have stripped the land by cutting down a large number of trees. In addition, they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the bear usually feeds, and many hibernation sites have also been lost. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (roads): deforestation = cutting down trees construction = built Explanation: the speaker now talks about threats to the white bear. In addition to cutting down trees, the logging companies have built roads. The answer is roads. 37. Answer: fishing Here’s what the speaker says: The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bears fish. To make matters worse, the number of salmon in those streams is declining because there is no legal limit on fishing at the moment. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (fishing): unrestricted = no legal limit Explanation: another threat to the white bear is that there is no legal limit on fishing. So, the number of salmon, on which the bear depends for food, is declining. The answer is fishing. 38. Answer: reproduction Here’s what the speaker says: All these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear’s very existence, which is made all the more fragile by the fact that reproduction among these bears has always been disappointingly low. Explanation: a final threat to the existence of the white bear is the fact that they do not have many young bears – the rate of reproduction is low. The answer is reproduction. 39. Answer: method / methods Here’s what the speaker says: The government is now requiring logging companies to adopt a better logging method, which is a positive step. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (method/methods): improve = adopt a better method Explanation: the idea of ‘requiring’ is that the government is ordering the logging companies that they ‘must’ improve their methods. The answer is method / methods. 40. Answer: expansion Here’s what the speaker says: While it is important to maintain the spirit bear’s habitat, there also needs to be more emphasis on its expansion. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (expansion): territory = habitat Explanation:the speaker mentions that the maintenance of the habitat of the spirit bear, and also says that it is necessary to expand its territory. The answer is expansion.",

Answer: month SECTION 2 11-12. Answer: C. It helps finance campaigns for changes in fishing practices, E. Volunteers help in various ways. Here’s what the speaker says: Obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the world. It tries to raise people’s awareness of the problems these marine creatures are suffering because of pollution and other threats. It started ten years ago and it’s one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country – although it’s still fairly small compared with the big players in animal protection. We are particularly proud of the work we do in in education – last year we visited a huge number of schools in different parts of the country, going round to talk to children and young people aged from five to eighteen. In fact, about 35% of our members are children. The charity uses its money to support campaigns – for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth. It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist – with dolphin expertise – to monitor populations. Of course, many people give their services on a voluntary basis and we now have volunteers working in observation, office work and other things. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C and E): help = support dolphin experts = biologists with dolphin expertise fishing practices = fishing policy Explanation: When introducing the Trust, Alice claims that despite being the fastest growing organization, it’s still small compared to its counterparts in the country. We can conclude that B is not the answer. Then she mentions children and young people as part of their membership. However, they make up about 35% of its members. To be “most of”, the percentage must be over 50%. Therefore, A is not the answer. Shealso states that the organization hopes to employ dolphin experts (which are called ‘biologists with dolphin expertise’ in the script), which means that this change may take place in the future, not now. They hope to employ their first full-time biologist in the future – so they do not have an expert at the moment. Hence D is not the answer. The two remaining answers are C and E. The fact that the Trust helps finance campaigns for changes in fishing practices is shown by an example which is mentioned by Alice, while she is talking about the way the organization uses its money. She also lists several jobs done by volunteers, which means its volunteers help in several (various) ways. C and E are the correct answers. 13. Answer: B. It made the work of the trust better known Here’s what the speaker says: I should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year – for our work in education. Although it’s not meant an enormous amount of money for us, it has made our activities even more widelypublicised and understood. In the long term it may not bring in extra members but we’re hoping it’llhave this effect. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): better known = more widely publicized and understood attract more members = bring in extra members Explanation: At first, Alice claims that award did not bring in a large amount of money for the organization and she doesn’t mention if it brings a small amount as extra money, so it may confuse students. However, the correct answer has to accurately mentioned in the script, therefore A is not the answer we are looking for. Alice also mentions the potential that the award may help to attract more members, but it is only what they hope for, hence C is not the answer. She states that the award made the organisation’s activities more widely publicized, which means they are known more widely by the public. The correct answer is B. 14. Answer: A. noise Here’s what the speaker says: And we have a big project in the east part of Scotland. This has long been a haven for dolphins because it has very little shipping. However, this may be about to change soon because oil companies want to increase exploration there. We’re campaigning against this because, although there’ll be little pollution from oil, exploration creates a lot of underwater noise. It means the dolphins can’t rest and socialize. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): oil leaks = pollution from oil movement of ships = shipping Explanation: Alice says that they are against oil exploration because it makes “a lot of underwater noise”. She mentions pollution from oil before, however it’s just “little”, which has a negative meaning that this isnot as much as expected, in other words, it doesn’t cause problems to dolphins. There is no information about movement of ships. Therefore, noises is the main reason here. A is the correct answer. 15. Answer: C. she read a book about them Here’s what the speaker says: This is how I became interested in dolphin conservation in the first place. I had never seen one and I hadn’t been particularly interested in them at school. Then I came across this story about a family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth because of the oil companies and about a child who campaigned to save them. I couldn’t put the book down – I was hooked. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): story = book Explanation: We need to focus from the time when Alice says “This is how I became interested in…” because we know after that will be the reason that we are trying to find out. She claims she had never seen one, which means she never saw one swimming near her home. Hence A is not the answer. She also didn’t have an interestin them at school, so the reason of hearing about them at school is not correct. B is not the answer. And then she tells us about the content of a book she read, about a family of dolphins. Therefore, it is that book that made her interested in dolphin conservaton. The correct answer is C. 16. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: I’d like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members: Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson. Unfortunately, Echo is beingrather elusive this year and hasn’t yet been sighted by our observers but we remain optimistic that he’ll be out there soon. All the others have been out in force – Samson and Moondancer often are photographed together but it is Kiwi who’s our real character as she seems to love coming up close for the cameras and we’ve captured her on film hundreds of times. They all have their own personalities – Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly, whereas Samson has a lot of energy – he’s always leaping out of the water with great vigour. You’d probably expect him to be the youngest – he’s not quite – that’s Kiwi – but Samson’s the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme. Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway. Echo and Moondancer are quite noisy too, but Moondancer’s easy to find because she has a particularly large fin on her back, which makes her easy to identify. So, yes, they’re all very different. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers: seen = sighted photographed = captured on film energetic = has a lot of energy the newest = the latest Explanation: Echo has not been sighted this year = the answer to Q16 is B. 17. Answer: C 18. Answer: D 19. Answer: D 20. Answer: A SECTION 3 21. Answer: C. the way he imagined his grandfather at work Here’s what the speakers say: ROB: My grandfather was a doctor before he retired, and I just based it on him. MIA: OK, but how? Did you talk to him about it? ROB: He must have all sorts of stories, but he never says much about his work, even now. He has a sort of authority though. MIA: So how did you manage to capture that? ROB: I’d just visualize what he must have been like in the past, when he was sitting in his consulting room listening to his patients. Here are some key words that can help you to get the correct answer (C): imagine = visualize Explanation: At first Mia asks Rob if he had talked to his grandfather about the life of a doctor. That question is related to answer A, and Rob did mention that his grandfather probably has a lot of stories, but it’s just a guess. He claims his grandfather never says much about his work, so it is impossible for him to base his character in the play on what his grandfather said. A is not the correct answer. Then he tells Mia that he visualizes – that is, he forms a picture in his mind – of his grandfather working, which can be considered as “imagine”. Rob doesn’t mention anything about going to where his grandfather was working so B is not correct. Rob only tried to imagine his grandfather at work. Therefore, the answer is C. 22. Answer: A. repetition of words and phrases Here’s what the speakers say: MIA: Then there is the issue of atmosphere – so in the first scene we needed to know how boring life was in the doctor’s village in the 1950s, so when the curtain went up on the first scene in the waiting room, there was that long silence before anyone spoke. And then people keep saying the same thing over and over, like “Cold, isn’t it?” ROB: Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): repetition = saying over and over Explanation: We pay attention when the speaker talks about “how boring life was in the village”, which refers to the boredom of the village. The first thing when the play begins is a long silence, which is the same as “long pauses” in answer C. However, in the answer C, they are long pauses within conversations, while it’s actually a long pause before the conversation. Therefore, C is not the correct answer. The clothes of the patients – not the scenery – have dull colours, grey and brown, so B is also incorrect. After that, Miatells us that peope keep saying the same thing over and over, which can be considered as repetition of words and phrases. A is the correct answer. 23. Answer: A. He likes to have clear ideas Here’s what the speakers say: ROB: And I have to analyse how I functioned in the group – what I found out about myself. I know I was so frustrated at times, when we couldn’t agree. MIA: Yes. So did one person emerge as the leader? ROB: Sophia did. That was OK – she helped us work out exactly what to do, for the production. And that made me feel better, I suppose. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): clear ideas = exactly what to do Explanation: Mia asks about the leader, and Rob points out that Sophia was the one. Therefore, he was not the leader and C is not the correct answer. Then he talks about what Sophia did, which was to point out exactly what to do. That leadership, giving clear ideas so that everyone understood what to do, made Rob feel better, so A is the correct answer. 24. Answer: B. changing social attitudes Here’s what the speakers say: ROB: And Sophia did some research too. That was useful in developing our approach. MIA: Like what? ROB: Well, she found these articles from the 1950s about how relationships between children and their parents, or between the public and people like bank managers or the police, were shifting. Explantion: Rob mentions the fact that the leader, Sophia, used some articles to do research. Those articles are about relationships between people in a society. There is no information related to political or economic issues. Therefore, the answer is B. 25. Answer: B. an equipment failure Here’s what the speakers say: MIA: And did you have any practical problems to overcome? ROB: Well, in the final rehearsal everything was going fine until the last scene – that’s where the doctor’s first patient appears on stage on his own. MIA: The one in the wheelchair? ROB: Yes, and he had this really long speech, with the stage all dark except for one spotlight – and then that stuck somehow so it was shining on the wrong side of the stage…but anyway we got that fixed, thank goodness. Explanation: Rob mentions the problem with one spotlight, which can be considered as an equipment failure. So the correct answer is B. When Mia mentions “the one in the wheelchair”, this may confuse students that the answer is the injury of one character (answer C). However, the fact that this patient is in a wheelchair does not mean that one of the actors was injured during the rehearsal – it is a part of the play. So, C is not correct. Then, the patient in the wheelchair had a really long speech but he did not forget his words. Therefore, A is also incorrect. 26. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: MIA: Yes, so next year when you are in the second year of the course, you need to work really hard in all your theatre studies modules. Only students with good marks get places – you have to prove that you know your subject really well. Here are some key words that help you get the correct answer (E): show = prove Explanation: Mia tells Rob that he will have to work hard in his second year to get good marks which prove that he knows a lot about theatre studies. In other words, he will have to show his ability in that subject. The answer is E. 27. Answer: D Here’s what the speakers say: ROB: Right. So how did you choose where to go? MIA: Well, I decided that I wanted a programme that would fit in with what I wanted to do after I graduate, so I looked for a university with emphasis on acting rather than directing for example. It depends on you. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (D): institution = university focus = emphasis Explanation: Mia advises Rob to look for a university that is suitable for what he wants to do in the future, which means that the university’s focus is relevant to his needs or wants. D is the answer. 28. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: MIA: Then about six months before you go, you have to email the scheme coordinator with your top three choices. I had a friend who missed the deadline and didn’t get her first choice, so you do need to get a move on at that stage. You’ll find that certain places are very popular with everyone. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): send in = email Explanation: Mia tells Rob about a friend who missed the deadline – a time or day by which something must be done, which means she advises him to be on time. A is the answer. 29. Answer: G Here’s what the speakers say: ROB: And don’t you have to write a personal statement at that stage? MIA: Yes. ROB: Right. I’ll get some of the final year students to give me some tips…maybe see if I can read what they wrote. Explanation: Rob is about to get some tips from final year students, which means he wants to get help from them. So when writing a personal statement, it is a good idea to ask for help. G is the correct answer. 30. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: MIA: I think that’s a very good idea. I don’t mind showing you what I did. And while you’re on broad don’t make the mistake I made. I got so involved I forgot all about making arrangements for when I came back here for the final year. Make sure you stay in touch so they know your choices for the optional modules. You don’t want to miss out doing your preferred specialisms. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): plan = make arrangements Explanation: Mia does mentions arrangements, but they are not travel arrangments, only choices for the optional modules. Hence, F is not the answer. There is no information about letters of recommendation, hence B is also not the answer. Mia wants to advise Rob to prepare, or plan for the final year, which is the answer C. SECTION 4 31. Answer: achievement/ achievements 32. Answer: personality/ character 33. Answer: situational 34.

Answer: shower 10. Answer: training SECTION 2 11. Answer: A. local people. Here’s what the speaker says: “Good morning. I’m very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments in the city: the Brackenside Open-Air Swimming Pool and the children’s Adventure Playrground in Central Park. As many of you may know, the idea of these initiatives came from you, the public, in the extensive consultation exercise which the City Council conducted last year. And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC – the South West Regional Development Commission.” Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): new developments = initiatives local people = the public Explanation: We have to pay attention from when the speaker mentions “new developments” and “the idea”. “Initiatives” are refered as “new developments”, and they came from the public, which has the same meaning as local people. The City Council is mentioned as the organization which conducted the consultation exercise for the idea, and that is funded by the SWRDC. It has to be noted that more than one answer is mentioned in the script, so students should be cautious and pay attention to the verb as well, not only the subjects mentioned. 12. Answer: C. its method of water treatment Here’s what the speaker says: “For the design of this new heated pool, we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally renowned architect Ellen Wendon, who has managed to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits in so well with many of the other buildings in the area, with up-to-the-minute features such as arecycling system – the only one of its kind in the world – which enables seawater to be used in the pool.” Here are the key words that help you get the correct answer (C) unusual = the only one of its kind water treatment = enable seawater to be used in the pool Explanation: In this part, the speaker mentions the renowned architect and her design for the pool. However, its design is mentioned as a good design which fits in so well with other buildings. There is no information about its design being unique or unusual. The speaker also says nothing about the heating system of the pool. Therefore, A and B are not the correct answer. Meanwhile, the speaker mentions one of modern features of the pool, – the recycling system – which allows seawater to be used in the pool, and claims it is the only one of its kind in the world, which means it is unique or unusual. Water treatment means the way you deal with the water, and here it is the use of seawater in the pool. The answer is C. 13. Answer: C. the size of the facilities Here’s what the speaker says: “Now,there has been quite a bit of discussion in the local press about whether there would be enough room for the number of visitors we’re hoping to attract, but the design is deceptive and there have been rigorous checks about capacity. Also, just in case youwere wondering, we’re on schedule for a June 15th opening date and well within budget; a testimony to the excellent work of local contractors Hickman’s.” Here are key words that help you get the correct answer (C) local newspapers = local press worries = discussion the size of the facilities = enoughroom, capacity Explanation: The speaker claims that the local press is now discussing whether there would be enough room for visitors, which means they are worried about the size or the capacity of the facilities there. Later, he refers to the opening date and states that they’re going well within budget, which means there is no problem or change in cost of the project. The project is ‘on schedule’, so it is not late and will open at the date announced. Hence, A and B are not the correct answer. It is C that is the answer. 14. Answer: A. whose statue will be at the door Here’s what the speaker says: We hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th. We have engaged award-winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open and there’ll be drinks and snacks available at the pool side. There’ll also be a competition for the public to decide on the sculpture we plan to have at the entrance; you will decide which famous historical figure from the city we should have. Here are key words that help you get the correct answer (A) statue = sculpture door = entrance to open = to declare the pool open to make a decision = to decide on Explanation: The speaker announces the opening day, which is on June 15th, but he doesn’t mention anything about the exact opening times, so B is not the answer. They also have an actress to declare the pool open, which means she will be the one who opens it. So who will open it is decided already. C is not the answer. The speaker then mentions a competition to find out which famous historical figure of the city will be used to make the sculpture at the entrance, which refers to the door. They haven’t had the result, so it is not decided yet. A is the correct answer. 15. Answer: E The first area to be mentioned is Asia. It is represented by equipment in the shape of several animals which are “native to the forests of the region” – their habitat is forests in Asia, so they are local animals. E is the answer for question 15 16. Answer: F We need to pay attention each time the speaker mentions an area. The next is the Antartic. The speaker mentions the option of making an ice rink but it is not possible because he says “couldn’t”. Therefore, ice and snow is not the answer here. Instead, they made “climbing blocks in the shape of mountains”. Therefore, mountains (F) is the answer for question 16. Students should take note of the verb “opt”, which means “make a choice from a range of possibilities”, so what is behind this verb often is the final and most important information we are looking for. 17. Answer: D When it comes to South America, the speaker mentions “precious stones”, which refers to jewels (precious stones that are used to decorate valuable objects). Therefore, the answer for question 17 is D 18. Answer: H What the speaker says about North America may confuse students. He claims that cinema and jazz (which are the same as music and film) were “considered”, which means they were taken into account but not necessarily the final choice. What we are looking for is the final decision, and that final decision is “rockets and the International Space Station” (which refers to “space travel”). Again, we need to pay attention to the verb “opt for”. The answer for question 18 is H. 19. Answer: A Regarding Europe, the speaker mentions “medieval castles and other fortifications”. “Medieval” is related to the Middle Ages (= the period in European history from about AD 600 to AD 1500).Therefore, they are castles and other fortifications from ancient times. A is the answer for question 19. 20. Answer: B The last area which is mentioned is Africa. Great rivers there are represented by mosaics and trails, therefore waterways is related to this area. B is the correct answer for question 20. SECTION 3 21-22. Answer: B. climbing, C. collecting 23-24. Answer: B. to experience an isolated place, E. to study the impact of an extreme environment 25. Answer: A. the fact that Eastern countries were far away Here’s what the speakers say: Up until that time of course, academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west. Yes, they thought that travel from the east was impossible, because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest inhabited land. Yes, but H spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible. And another argument was that there was no tradition for large ship-building in the communities lying to the east of Polynesia. But H knew they made lots of voyages in locally built canoes. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A) Polynesian migration from the east = humans migrate to the islands in Polynesia/ travel from the east far away = the huge, empty stretch of ocean the direction of the winds and currents = ocean currents and wind patterns boat-building = ship-building due to = because of Explanation: In the above dialogue, Victor claims that academics thought it was impossible due to the huge, empty stretch of ocean. Stretch means “a continuous area of a land or water” (here it is the ocean), which refers to a huge distance between the islands and the nearest land. Therefore, the answer for this is due to the fact that Eastern countries were far away. Later the two speakers mention ocean currents and wind patterns (which refer to the direction of the winds and currents), and things related to materials for building the ship, but they are only factors that were taken into consideration in later studies. They are not the main reason which made academics assume the migration was impossible. Therefore, A is the answer. 26. Answer: C. to test a new theory Here’s what the speakers say: Yes, or sailing on rafts, as shown by the long voyage that H did next. It was an incredibly risky journey to undertake – sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know? To show others that he could have spectacular adventures. What do you think, Olivia? I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea, to see if migration from the east was possible. Yes, that’s probably it. And the poor guy suffered a bit at that time because the war forced him to stop his work for some years… Here are some key words that help you get the correct answer (C) to test = to try out new theory = idea Explanation: At first, the speaker Victor suggests a private reason which is that H did that trip to show others that he could have spectacular adventures. This is the same as to demonstrate a personal quality. However, the question is about a main reason on which both speakers agree, meanwhile Olivia doesn’t agree with it and suggests another reason. Therefore, B is not the correct answer. Olivia thinks the main reason is just simply trying out his idea, which we can understand as to test a new theory, and Victor agreed by saying “Yes, that’s probably it”. This speaker also mentions a research setback which is the war, but it is just a minor factor stopping H’s research for some years. Hence, the answer we are looking for is C. 27. Answer: C. the use of authentic construction methods Here’s what the speakers say: When he got started again and planned his epic voyage, do you think it was important to him that he achieve it before anyone else did? I haven’t read anywhere that that was his motivation. The most important factor seems to have been that he use only ancient techniques and local materials to build his raft. Yes, I wonder how fast it went. Here are some key words that help you get the correct answer (C) the first person to do it = he achieve it before anyone else did authentic = ancient and local methods = techniques construction = build Explanation: The speaker Olivia suggests a possible reason, which is H being the first person to do it. However, it is just a suggestion from her, students have to pay attention to the next answer of the other speaker. And Victor denies it, so A is not the correct answer. Victor thinks the most important factor is the fact that H use only authentic methods and materials, and the other speaker agreed by saying “yes”. She wonders how fast it went, which refers to the speed of the journey, but it is not one of the important factors considered. Thererfore, the answer is C. 28. Answer: A. to build a stone statue Here’s what the speakers say: We should mention the purpose of that trip. I think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds. No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia. Oh, yes, that’s right. But what he wanted to do was talk to the local people about their old stone carvings and then make one himself to learn more about the process. Here are some key words that help you get the correct answer (A) build = make stone statue = stone carving Explanation: This is a why question, which means we have to look for a reason why or the purpose/ aim of H doing that trip, therefore we have to pay more attention when the speakers mention “the purpose”. Olivia mentions a reed boat, which is in answer B. However, Victor points out that H uses a reed boat only later on in another trip. Hence, B is not the answer. He claims that H wanted to make old stone carvings himself after talking to local people, which means the purpose of that trip is to make a stone statue, so A is the correct answer. We need to be cautious when the speaker mentions H talking to local people, students may think learning the local language is his aim, but actually it is not. He wants to talk to local people to find out how to build a stone statue. 29. Answer: B. the development of archaeological methodology. Here’s what the speakers say: “Well, what a great life. Even though many of his theories have been disproven, he certainly left a lasting impression on many disciplines, didn’t he? To my mind, he was the first person to establish what modern academics call practical archaeology. I mean, that they try to recreate something from the past today, like he did with his raft trip. It’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians orginated from have been completely discredited.” Here are some key words to help you get the correct answer (B) in one’s opinion = to one’s mind great influence = lasting impression Explanation: The question is about Olivia’s opinion, so we need to focus on what she says when she starts saying “to my mind”, because they have the same meaning. Before that, she mentions that H’s theories have been proved wrong. A is not the correct answer. Instead, she claims that he was the first person to establish practical archaeology, not archaeology as an academic subject. Trying to recreate something from the past influenced the methods of archaeologists. Therefore, B is the answer. 30. Answer: A. its style is out of date Here’s what the speakers say I mainly used The Life and Work of Thor Heyerdahl by William Oliver. I thought the research methods he used were very sound, although I must say I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned, I think they need to do a new, revised edition. Here are some key words that can help you to get the correct answer (A) methodology = research methods style = tone out of date = old-fashioned Explanation: At first, the speaker tells us his opinion about the research methods of Oliver, and he thinks they are very sound, which means complete and able to be trusted. Therefore, C is not the answer (because in the answer C, it is believed that its research methods are flawed – flawed means not perfect or containing mistakes). Then, he can’t deny that he found the overall tone, which refers to the style used in that book, somewhat old-fashioned (which has the same meaning as “out-of-date”). There is no information about its content. Hence, A is the correct answer. SECTION 4 31. Answer: competition Here’s what the speaker says: “One area I want to mention is business markets, and I’m sure a really significant development will be a major increase in competition, with companies from all round the world trying to sell similar products” Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (competition): greater = a major increase Explanation: the speaker makes clear that the subject is business markets, and refers to a significant future development, which will be more competition. The answer is competition. 32. Answer: global Here’s what the speaker says: “At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are actually losing power to major global corporations. We can probably all think of companies that exert a great deal of influence….” Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (global): large = major companies = corporations Explanation: the power of governments is decreasing, because the power of major global corporations is increasing, so the answer is global. 33. Answer: demand Here’s what the speaker says: “A third point I want to make is about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India, China, Brazil and Russia, demand is growing very fast” Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (demand): rising = growing Explanation: the question mentions ‘certain countries’, and these are named by the speaker. In these expanding economies, demand for products is rising/growing. So, the answer is demand. 34. Answer: customers Here’s what the speaker says: “I think businesses are becoming more open to external influences. In particular, companies are consulting customers more and more before making their business decisions. Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then trying to sell them….” Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (customers): discussion with = consulting Explanation: the speaker refers to what businesses do nowadays before making business decisions, and consulting customers is one thing that businesses now do more often. The answer is customers. 35. Answer: regulation/regulations Here’s what the speaker says: “Another influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers to extend product lifecycles, to reduce the amount of pollution and waste. And, in some cases, regulation will need to be strengthened.” Explanation: another external influence is then mentioned by the speaker. Concerns about the environment will lead to some changes by manufacturers, and governments may need to strengthen regulations. The answer is regulation/regulations. 36. Answer: projects Here’s what the speaker says: “Many societies are much more fluid and democratic, and the structure of companies is going to reflect that. I think we’re going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind.” Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (project): formed = created particular = specific Explanation: the speaker now refers to the structure of companies. More teams within companies will be formed to work on particular/specific projects. The answer is projects. 37. Answer: flexible Here’s what the speaker says: “…businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being able to choose among a lot of applicants. Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible working hours and……remote working, with people based at their home, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose.” Explanation: in order to attract staff, businesses may have to offer attractive conditions, such as working hours that are flexible. The answer is flexible. 38. Answer: leadership Here’s what the speaker says: “Management styles will almost certainly continue to change. Senior managers will require a lot more than the efficiency that they’ve always needed. Above all they’ll need great skills in leadership…” Explanation: the speaker now talks about management styles. Senior managers have always needed to be efficient. They will also need to have skills in leadership. The answer is leadership. 39. Answer: women Here’s what the speaker says: “In most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties. The predominant style of management will almost certainly become more consultative and collaborative, caused above all by more women moving into senior management positions.” Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (women): roles = positions Explanation: future styles of management will change – there will be more consultation and working together (collaboration). The reason for this change will be more women working in management positions. The answer is women. 40. Answer: self-employed Here’s what the speaker says: “Instead, more and more people are becoming self-employed, to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they’re unlikely to get from being employed” Explanation: talking about ‘developments in the wider economy’, the speaker refers to the trend for more people to become self-employed. This means that they do not work for an employer, they work for themselves. The answer is self-employed.",

Answer: free entry 18. Answer: peak 19. Answer: guests 20. Answer: photo card / photo cards SECTION 3 21. Answer: C.develop a new use for current technology. Here’s what the speaker says: It’s an international design competition and we will have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic kitchen appliance. I see, and are there any special conditions? Does it have to save energy for example? Actually it was the focus in last year’s competition. This year is different. We have to adopt an innovative approach to existing technology, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): develop = adopt a new use = an innovative approach….using it (existing technology) in a way that hasn’t been thought of before. current = existing Explanation: Answers A and B contain key words “energy-efficient” and “energy-saving” that can confuse students, because they have the same meaning as “save energy” in the script. However, “it has to save energy” was the focus in last year’s competition. This year, the design competition is different. Therefore, A is not correct. We have to pay attention to the answer right after ‘it has to save energy’ to see if it is true or not. It is a common trick in Listening tests. Answer B is not correct because this also refers to ‘energy-saving’, but we know now that this is NOT the focus of the design competition this year. In addition, answer B contains exactly the same words as the script (existing, appliance). Be careful with this kind of answer. A small difference in the words used can change the meaning completely, hence it turns out to be the wrong answer. 22. Answer: A. more appealing. Here’s what the speaker says: Interesting, what made you choose that? Well, they’re an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses but they are all pretty boring and almost identical to each other. I think some people will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): more appealing = look different common = everyday Explanation: John states that most Australian houses have dishwashers – that’s what he means when he says that ‘they’re an everyday kitchenappliance’. So, he does not want to make them more common – Answer B is NOTcorrect. After that, he believes people will “pay a little extra”, which means the price will be a little higher, so it can’t be “economical” (which means saving money). Therefore, C is NOT the answer. John hopes people will buy his product because it is something that ‘looks different’, which means they are attracted to it, or they find it appealing. A is the answer. 23. Answer: B. to switch it on. Here’s what the speaker says: I see you’ve called your design “the Rockpool”. Why is that? Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach. The top is made of glass so you can look down into it. And there’s a stone at the bottom. Is that just for decoration? Actually it does have a function. Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): to be used = have a function switch it on = push a button Explanation: We pay attention from the time when the speakers mention “the Rockpool”. One of them mentions the stone and asks if that is just for decoration. “Just” means the stone is only used for decoration and does not have any other purpose. But this is a question, so we have to listen to the answer. John claims it does have a function, which means it will be used for a particular purpose. Therefore, A is NOTthe answer. There is no mention of ‘water escaping’, so Answer C is NOT correct. “Pushing a button” is what you do to switch a machine on. John states that with this rockpool, you don’t push a button, ‘you turn the stone’. Hence, turning the stone has the same function as pushing a button, which is to switch the rockpool on. The answer is B. 24. Answer: A. changes back to a gas. Here’s what the speaker says To allow them to dry, the liquid carbon dioxide and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding chamber. That’s where the liquid is depressurized and so it reverts to a gas. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): change back= revert Explanation: At first, the speaker mentions “to dry”, however, it is notthe carbon dioxide itself but the whole process that does that function of drying the dishes. The speaker mentions both the liquid carbon dioxide and the waster materials in the holding chamber, and then explains what will happen in that chamber. Therefore, B is NOT correct. It CANNOT be Answer C, because we know that the liquid is ‘depressurised’ = it loses pressure, but no mention is made of the temperature of the liquid. He uses “theliquid” to refer to “the liquid carbon dioxide”, making it hard for students to understand immediately, hence they are not able to find the answer. “Revert” means “change back”. The answer is A. 25. Answer: C. is collected ready to be re-used. Here’s what the speaker says What happens to the carbon dioxide once the process is complete? Not wasted I hope. Actually, that’s where the real savings are made. The carbon dioxide is sent back to the cylinder and can be used again and again. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): at the end of the cleaning process = once the process is complete re-used = used again and again Explanation: We pay attention when one of the speakers asks about what happens to the carbon dioxide once the process is complete, which means at the end of the process. John states “real savings are made”, which means it is not wasted, such as being released to the air or being disposed of. Therefore, A and B are NOT the answer. John says that it will be sent back, which we can understand as being collected at the cylinder, then ‘used again and again’, which means “re-used”. The answer is C. 26. Answer: presentation 27. Answer: model 28. Answer: material / materials 29. Answer: grant 30. Answer: technical SECTION 4 31. Answer: gene Here’s what the speaker says: One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the result of a special gene that surfaces in a few. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (gene): comes from = the result of uncommon = special Explanation: we are told that the white colour of the coat of a few bears comes from an unusual gene. The answer is gene. 32. Answer: power / powers Here’s what the speaker says: Local people have named it ‘the spirit bear’. And according to the legends of these communities, its snowy fur brings with it a special power. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (power/powers): believe = legends unusual = special Explanation: local people have a legend that this white (snowy) colour of the fur has an unusual power. The answer is power / powers. 33. Answer: strangers Here’s what the speaker says: Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them – so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else. It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area. Explanation: so, the local people do not talk about the bear to strangers, in order to help to protect it. The answer is strangers. 34. Answer: erosion Here’s what the speaker says: The white bear’s habitat is quite interesting. The bear’s strong relationship with the old-growth rainforest is a complex one. The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways. For example, the old-growth trees have extremely long roots that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams. Keeping these banks intact is important because these streams are home to salmon….. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (erosion): stop = prevent Explanation: the long roots of the old trees prevent the soil from falling into the rivers (streams), maintaining the habitat of the salmon. The process when soil falls into rivers is called ‘erosion’. The answer is erosion. 35. Answer: islands Here’s what the speaker says: Today the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (islands): currently = today a small number = a few Explanation: we learn that the white bear ‘is found’ (‘lives’) on a few islands. The answer is islands. 36. Answer: roads Here’s what the speaker says: The greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat. Over many years, logging companies have stripped the land by cutting down a large number of trees. In addition, they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the bear usually feeds, and many hibernation sites have also been lost. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (roads): deforestation = cutting down trees construction = built Explanation: the speaker now talks about threats to the white bear. In addition to cutting down trees, the logging companies have built roads. The answer is roads. 37. Answer: fishing Here’s what the speaker says: The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bears fish. To make matters worse, the number of salmon in those streams is declining because there is no legal limit on fishing at the moment. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (fishing): unrestricted = no legal limit Explanation: another threat to the white bear is that there is no legal limit on fishing. So, the number of salmon, on which the bear depends for food, is declining. The answer is fishing. 38. Answer: reproduction Here’s what the speaker says: All these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear’s very existence, which is made all the more fragile by the fact that reproduction among these bears has always been disappointingly low. Explanation: a final threat to the existence of the white bear is the fact that they do not have many young bears – the rate of reproduction is low. The answer is reproduction. 39. Answer: method / methods Here’s what the speaker says: The government is now requiring logging companies to adopt a better logging method, which is a positive step. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (method/methods): improve = adopt a better method Explanation: the idea of ‘requiring’ is that the government is ordering the logging companies that they ‘must’ improve their methods. The answer is method / methods. 40. Answer: expansion Here’s what the speaker says: While it is important to maintain the spirit bear’s habitat, there also needs to be more emphasis on its expansion. Here are the key words that help you to get the correct answer (expansion): territory = habitat Explanation:the speaker mentions that the maintenance of the habitat of the spirit bear, and also says that it is necessary to expand its territory. The answer is expansion.",

Answer: babies Here’s what the speakers say: MAN: Yes, I’ve just moved to this area with my wife and children and I’d like to know where we can all register with a doctor at a Health Centre. WOMAN: Okay, well there’s Doctor Green at the Harvey Clinic. We alwaysrecommend her for babies, because she’s very good with them and she runs a special clinic. Explanation:the woman suggests that the man should register his family with Dr Green, because this doctor is very good with the treatment of babies. The answer is babies. 2. Answer: Eschol Here’s what the speakers say: MAN: Is there anywhere else I could try? WOMAN: Yes, the Eshcol Health Practice is the next one on my list. MAN: How do you spell that? WOMAN: E-S-C-H-O-L. And it’s Dr Fuller who has space on his list. Explanation:this Health Practice has an unusual name, so the woman spells the name for the man. The answer is Eschol. 3. Answer: evening Here’s what the speaker says: WOMAN: And it’s particularly good if you’re busy during the day, because they also do appointments in the evening. They’re closed on Saturday, though. Explanation:the woman tells the man that the Health Practice also has evening appointments. The answer is evening. 4. Answer: Gormley Here’s what the speaker says: WOMAN: The only other place on the list is the Health Centre on Shore Lane. You can register with Doctor Gormley, that’s G-O-R-M-L-E-Y. Explanation:woman gives the name of the doctor at Shore Lane Health Centre. The answer is Gormley. 5-6 . Answer: B. employment medicals, E. vaccinations Here’s what the speaker says: WOMAN: Erm … there are usually some small charges that doctors make. Let me see what it says about the Shore Lane Centre. If you need to be vaccinated before any trips abroad, you won’t have to pay for this. Erm, what else? The sports injury treatment service operates on a paying basis, as does the nutritional therapy service. Some health centres do offer alternative therapies like homeopathy as part of their pay-to-use service. Shore Lane are hoping to do this soon – I think they may start with acupuncture. And finally, if you need to prove you’re healthy or haven’t had any serious injuries before a new employer will accept you, you can get a free fitness check-up there, but you’d most likely have to pay for insurance medicals though. Explanation: Acupuncture is mentioned only as an example of what Shore Lane may do in the future, so it is not available yet, and if it is available later then it will be part of a pay-to-use service – it won’t be free. Thus, A is incorrect. Meanwhile, we know from the recording that sports injury treatment operates on “a paying basis”, so you have to pay for this. Therefore, C is also wrong. However, you won’t have to pay for vaccinations before any trips abroad, so E is correct. Note that “trips” may lead you into thinking about “travel”, but there is no mention about an advice service at Shore Lane, so D is incorrect. Finally, fitness check-ups for employment purposes (which can be considered “employment medicals”) are said to be free, so B is correct. The answers are B, E. 7. Answer: heart Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: You might also be interested to know the Centre is running a pilot scheme of talks for patients. I’ve got the list here. Actually, they look very interesting. MAN: What sort of things? WOMAN: Well, the first one’s about giving up smoking. It’s next week, the twenty-fifth of February, at 7pm, and that’s in Room 4. It says, the talk will stress the health benefits particularly for people with asthma or heart disease. Explanation:the woman tells the man about the talks at Shore Lane Health Centre. The first talk on the list on ‘giving up smoking’ will focus on the health benefits for people with asthma or heart disease/heart problems. The answer is heart. 8. Answer: primary school Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: There’s also a talk for families with children. It’s on Healthy Eating, and takes place on the first of March at five o’clock. MAN: Will that be at the Health Centre? WOMAN: Erm, actually it’s at the primary school on Shore Lane. Explanation:the next talk on the woman’s list is on the first of March. However, this talk is not at the Health Centre, it is at the primary school on Shore Lane. The answer is primary school. 9. Answer: 4.30/four thirty. Here’s what the speaker says: WOMAN: There’s a couple of other talks – one giving advice about how to avoid injuries while doing exercise. It’s on the ninth of March. Oh, it’s a late afternoon talk, at four thirty, and it’ll be in Room 6. Explanation:the woman says that the next talk will be on the ninth of March, at 4.30 in the afternoon. The answer is 4.30/four thirty. 10. Answer: ages Here’s what the speaker says: WOMAN: It also says the talk is suitable for all ages. Explanation: the woman gives more information about this talk, saying that it is suitable for all ages. The answer is ages. SECTION 2 11. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: MAN: In the upstairs cupboard, you’ll find the water heater. You’ll see three main controls on the left at the bottom of the heater. The first one – the round one on the far left – is the most important one for the heating and hot water. It’s the main control switch. Make sure it’s in the ‘on’ position. Explanation: don’t be confused between numbers 11 and 12 on the diagram. The control on the far left is number 11. It is the main control switch (on and off). The man says that it must be in the ‘on’ position. The answer is B. 12. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: MAN: Below the heating controls in the middle is a small round plastic button. If there isn’t enough water in the pipes, sometimes the heater goes out. If this happens, you’ll need to press this button to reset the heater. Explanation: we now have to look for a small round button below the heating controls. The man says that you have to press this to reset the heater, so it is obviously the reset button. The answer is C. 13. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: MAN: Then there’s a little square indicator under the third knob that’s a kindof alarm light. It’ll flash if you need to reset the heater. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (E): warning indicator = alarm light Explanation: the third knob is for hot water. Below this, there is a small square indicator, an alarm/warning light. The answer is E. 14. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: Pillows … yes. If you look in the cupboard, the large white one upstairs – to the left of the bathroom door – there should be four or five on the top shelf. Explanation: The pillows are said to be in the cupboard upstairs, so B is the answer. 15. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: And if you want to do some washing, there’s some powder for that … probably by the back door. There’s a kind of shelf there above the sink. In fact, I’m sure there’s some there, in a large blue box. You need about half a cup full for each wash. Explanation: Be careful with answers that contain the same words as in the recording, because they are usually not correct and you have to listen for the idea, not exact words. The washing powder is said to be “by the back door”, maybe in a “shelf above the sink”, hence E is correct. 16. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: And that reminds me, the spare key to the back door is hanging on a hook on the wall by the sitting room window. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (D): living room = sitting room Explanation: Note that the key is TO the back door, not BY the back door. It is actually by the window of the sitting room (or living room). Hence, the answer is D. 17. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: And if you have any trouble with the lamps, you’ll find some spare bulbs in a large cardboard box. It’s on top of the washing machine with all kinds of useful things in it. Explanation: The bulbs are said to be in a box, and that box is on top of the washing machine, so the answer has to be A. 18. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: I’ve left you a local map, so you’ll be able to find your way around easily. It shows the whole area. I put it in the top drawer of the chest under the TV in your bedroom. Explanation: The speaker says he put the map in the “drawer of the chest”, thus C is clearly the answer. 19. Answer: 732281 Here’s what the speaker says: But if you want a takeaway, the Italian one does really good pasta and pizzas. Call 7-3-double 2 -8-1 for that. Explanation: the man talks about good restaurants in the area, and gives the phone number for a takeaway pizza. The answer is 732281. 20. Answer: Thursday(s) Here’s what the speaker says: As for places to visit, yes, do go and see the railway museum. The exhibition is small but really good. It gets very crowded on Sundays, so I suggest you visit it on a quieter day, later in the week, but not on Thursdays which is market day – you won’t find anywhere to park and it’s also the onlyday of the week when they’re not open! Explanation: the man says that it is not a good idea to visit the railway museum on Sunday, because it is too crowded. It is better to go during the week, but not on Thursday, when the museum is closed/not open. The answer is Thursday/Thursdays. SECTION 3 21. Answer: A. completed a course. Here’s what the speakers say: KIRA: Actually, I went straight into third year Pharmacy. They credited me with two years, which probably made it more difficult for me. PAUL: On the other hand, you were lucky to be granted credits. Is that why you chose the course? KIRA: Yes. And, as I’d already finished a course in it in my country, I thought it would be easier if I studied something I already knew. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): complete = finish Explanation: C is wrong because Kira says being credited with two years “made it more difficult” for her, so she found the course here difficult, NOT the course in her country. B is wrong because Kira says nothing about having done 2 years of a course in her own country.From the recording, we know that Kira was credited with two years and went straight to third year, but that does not mean that she had studied those two years in her home country. In fact, she had finished a Pharmacy course there, so the correct answer must be A (as “complete” and “finish” are similar). 22. Answer: C. change her way of thinking. Here’s what the speaker says: KIRA: People expect you to have problems with the process of reading and writing but, in fact, it is more a question of altering your viewpoint towardsacademic study. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): change = alter way of thinking = viewpoint Explanation: Concerning the assignments, Kira says that the problem is NOT actually related to reading and writing as people usually expect, so A and B are incorrect. The real problem for Kira is that she had to “alter her viewpoint”, which means the same as “change her way of thinking”. C is the correct answer. 23. Answer: approach Here’s what the speakers say: PAUL: And what about the lecturers themselves? Are they essentially the same as lecturers in your country? KIRA: Well actually, no. Here, they’re much easier to approach. After every lecture you can go and ask them something you didn’t understand. Explanation: Kira says that lecturers here are easier to approach. She then explains what she means: after the lecture, you can go to them and ask about anything that you didn’t understand. The answer is approach. 24. Answer: mature Here’s what the speaker says: PAUL: Maybe you found them different because you’re a mature student now, whereas when you were studying in your country you were younger and not so assertive. Explanation: Paul thinks that maybe Kira finds it easier to approach the lecturers and ask questions, because she is now older (=more mature) than when she was studying before. As a result, she is now more assertive. The answer is mature. 25. Answer: interest Here’s what the speaker says: KIRA: In my faculty, they all seem to make appointments – usually to talk about something in the course that’s worrying them, but sometimes just about something that might really interest them, something they might want to specialise in. The lecturers must set aside certain times every week when they’re available for students. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (interest): discuss = talk about very much = really Explanation: most students in Kira’s faculty make appointments to see their lecturers. The students may want to discuss something which worries them, or to talk about something that interests them. The answer is interest. 26. Answer: groups/in groups/small groups/in small groups Here’s what the speaker says: KIRA: Apart from lectures, we had practical sessions in a lot of subjects. We did these in small groups. Explanation: Kira simply explains that ‘we’ (the students) did their practical sessions in small groups. The answer is groups/in groups/small groups/in small groups. 27. Answer: every second day/every 2 days/every two days Here’s what the speaker says: KIRA: Then in second semester, we had to get experience in hospital dispensaries, so every second day we went to one of the big hospitals and worked there. Explanation: Kira talks about the second semester of the pharmacy course. The students had to get experience of working in a hospital, and every second day she went to a big hospital to work there. (Every second day = for example, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays). The answer is every second day/every 2 days/every two days. 28. Answer: 2 weeks/ two weeks Here’s what the speaker says: KIRA: Oh, I nearly forgot, between first and second semesters, we had to work full-time for two weeks in a hospital. Explanation: Kira now talks about working full-time.She worked full-time in a hospital for two weeks. The answer is 2 weeks/two weeks. 29. Answer: confident/more confident/much more confident Here’s what the speakers say: PAUL: So are you pleased now that you did it? Do you feel some sense of achievement? KIRA: Yeah, I do feel much more confident, which I suppose is the most important thing. Explanation: Now that the year of study has finished, Kira says that she feels more confident. The answer is confident/more confident/much more confident. 30. Answer: (the) education system Here’s what the speakers say: PAUL: And have you got any recommendations for people who are studying from overseas? KIRA: Well, I suppose they need very good English. It would be much better if they spent more time learning English before they enter the university, because you can be in big trouble if you don’t understand what people are saying and you haven’t got time to translate. PAUL: Anything else? KIRA: Well, as I said before, the biggest problem for me was a lack offamiliarity with the education system here. Explanation: Kira mentions the problem of learning English thoroughly. She also thinks that students need to be familiar with the education system here – this was a problem that she experienced. The answer is (the) education system. SECTION 4 31. Answer: C. They wanted to investigate a recent phenomenon. Here’s what the speaker says: First of all, how did we choose our topic? Well, there are four of us in the group and one day while we were discussing a possible focus, two of the group mentioned that they had seen yet more sparrow-hawks – one of Britain’s most interesting birds of prey – in their own city centre gardens and wondered why they were turning up in these gardens in great numbers. We were all very engaged by the idea of why wild animals would choose to inhabit a city garden. Why is it so popular with wildlife when the countryside itself is becoming less so? Explanation: Some may choose A because there is the word “species”in it, which may refer to the sparrow-hawks. However, from the recording we only know that the birds had moved from the countryside to the city in great numbers, but whether their population declined or not isn’t known, hence A is incorrect. The speaker does not mention anything relating to the effects of the city on the birds either, hence B is wrong. The group were just interested in (= engaged by) the phenomenon (meaning “a situation that is observed to exist or happen”) of seeing these birds of prey in a city garden. C is the correct answer. 32. Answer: A. consulting some official documents. Here’s what the speaker says: The first thing we did was to establish what proportion of the urban land is taken up by private gardens. We estimated that it was about one fifth, and this was endorsed by looking at large-scale usage maps in the town land survey office – 24% to be precise. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): devoted to = taken up by confirmed = endorsed surveyors = survey Explanation: “the town land survey office” is similar to “town surveyors” and is mentioned by the speaker, but there wasn’t any discussion with the surveyors who worked in the office, so C is incorrect. In addition, do not get tricked by answer B with “large-scale photos”. These may be somewhat similar to “large-scale maps” but the group did NOT take photos, they just looked at the maps available, so B is wrong. The group looked at the usage maps in the town land survey office, which can be considered “official documents”, so the correct answer is A. 33. Answer: B. keep a record of animals they saw. Here’s what the speaker says: … so we decided to survey garden owners from different areas of the city. Just over 100 of them completed a survey once every two weeks for twelve months – ticking off species they had seen from a pro forma list – and adding the names of any rarer ones. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): animals = species Explanation: The group asked the garden owners to take part in a survey, NOT interviews, hence A is incorrect. There is no mention made of “getting in contact” although rare species are mentioned, so C is incorrect as well. What the garden owners did was ticking off common species that they had seen, and adding those that were considered rarer, to a list provided by the group. From this we can understand that the group was trying to make a record of the animals that came to gardens. Therefore, B is the answer. 34. Answer: B. which they considered to be representative. Here’s what the speaker says: Meanwhile, we were doing our own observations in selected gardens throughout the city. We deliberately chose smaller ones because they were by far the most typical in the city. The whole point of the project was to look at the norm not the exception. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): representative = typical = the norm Explanation: The group chose smaller gardens because these are “typical” and considered “the norm”, meaning there are mostly small gardens in the city. The purpose of this selection was to study certain gardens and draw a conclusion from this study, but the results needed to be representative of all the gardens in the city. Hence, the correct answer is B. 35. Answer: A. wildlife problems in rural areas. Here’s what the speaker says: Alongside this primary research on urban gardens, we were studying a lot of books about the decline of wild animals in the countryside and thinking of possible causes for this. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): wildlife = wild animals rural area = countryside Explanation: The group studied a lot of books, which means that they did “extensive reading” and these books were about “the decline of wild animals in the countryside”. The reference to “wild animals” is the same as “wildlife” and “the countryside” is the same as “rural areas”. Therefore this can be paraphrased into “the decline of wildlife in rural areas” and this decline can be considered a problem. So A is correct. 36. Answer: C. they best indicated general trends. Here’s what the speaker says: What we’ve decided to present today is information about just three species – because we felt these gave a good indication of the processes at work in rural and urban settings as a whole. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): indicated =gave an indication general = as a whole Explanation: A and B are not mentioned by the speaker. The reason why the group concentrated on only three species was that these three species “gave a good indication” (which means “indicated well”) the processes of their work “as a whole” (similar to “general”). Therefore, C is correct. 37. Answer: frogs/frog Here’s what the speaker says: The first species to generate a lot of interesting information was frogs. And there was a clear pattern here – they proliferate where there is suitable water. Explanation: the speaker refers to ‘the first species’ (= the first species of animals), and this species was frogs. Garden ponds, the speaker then says, are on the increase, while rural ponds are declining. So, there is a large migration of frogs to city gardens. The answer is frogs/frog. 38. Answer: predators Here’s what the speaker says: Hedgehogs are also finding it easier to live in urban areas – this time because their predators are not finding it quite so attractive to leave their rural environment, so hedgehogs have a better survival rate in cities. Explanation: the speaker now talks about hedgehogs. They are able to survive more easily in cities, because they are safer. And they are safer because the animals which threaten them (= their predators) do not find it easy to survive in cities. The answer is predators. 39. Answer: count Here’s what the speaker says: We had a lot of sightings, so all in all we had no difficulties with our efforts to count their numbers precisely. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (count): easy = no difficulty Explanation: the speaker reports thatmany people who completed the survey forms reported seeing hedgehogs in their gardens (= ‘we had a lot of sightings’). It was therefore easy to count the numbers of hedgehogs. The answer is count. 40. Answer: seed/ seeds Here’s what the speaker says: Our final species is the finest of bird singers, the song thrush. On the decline in the countryside, they are experiencing a resurgence in urban gardens because these days gardeners are buying lots of different plants which means there’s an extensive range of seeds around, which is what they feed on. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (seed(s)): variety = range eat = feed on Explanation: the speaker says that the song thrush is surviving well (‘experiencing a resurgence’) in city/urban gardens, because there are a lot of seeds for these birds to eat. The answer is seed/seeds.",

Answer: item 10. Answer: Ludlow SECTION 2 11. Answer: C. his visit to another park. Here’s what the speaker says: The place was wonderful for the kids: they particularly loved trains and gradually built up an enormous network of miniature railway track. I began to develop larger-scale models of locomotives but we didn’t think anything more of it until I went on a trip to a theme park near Birmingham and decided we could do a much better job! Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): visit = trip Explanation:Trains were a hobby of his children, not Simon’s childhood hobby. So, A is incorrect.Landscape design is not mentioned, so B is also incorrect. After his visit (or trip) to a theme park, Simon decided they “could do a much better job”. This means that he thought he could build a better park than the one he visited, so we may say that the idea of his own theme park came from this. The correct answer is C. 12. Answer: B. the children weren’t at school. Here’s what the speaker says: So we set up a small one ourselves based on the miniature railway and weopened to the public for just a month that year, 1984 – in July – our driest month – because our children said they didn’t want our guests to have a miserable, wet visit. I dealt with Park business and Liz carried on with the farm work. Explanation: “the children” were mentioned by Simon only to give a reason for the park’s opening date, so B is not relevant to the question. Likewise, concerning “farming”, we can only know from the recording that Liz carried on the farm work, but whether farming duties affected the park opening is unknown, hence C is not given. The reason why the park was first open in the driest month is because they did not want their guests to have a wet visit in the rain, which means that they wanted the weather to be good for the visitors. The correct answer is A. 13. Answer: C. 1,500,000 visitors. Here’s what the speaker says Nowadays, we’re open all year round and we’re pleased to say that Winridge is one of the most popular visitor attractions in the area – with 50,000 visitors a year – a million and a half people have been through our doors since we opened. Explanation: Beware that 50,000 people is just the number of visitors PER year, but the question asks about the number of visitors since opening. That is 1,500,000 according to Simon. Therefore C is correct. 14. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: All these visitors mean we have had to expand our operation and it’s now a truly family concern. I’m near to retirement age so I only concern myself with looking after the mechanical side of things – keeping the trains going. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (E): engine = mechanical maintenance = look after Explanation:The speaker says his job is to look after the mechanical side of things. The word “mechanical” refers to machinery, so it can be understood that he looks after the engines, and of course by “look after” he means making sure the engines work properly, and are in working order (= keeping them going) in other words, “maintenance”. The correct answer is E. 15. Answer: H Here’s what the speaker says: Liz now devotes all her energies to recruiting and supporting the large squadron of workers, which keep the place running smoothly. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (H): staffing = recruiting Explanation: Liz is said to be in the area of “recruiting”, which basically means “hiring new workers”. Also, she supports “the large squadron of workers” (referring to a large number of workers), hence we know that her job is related to “staffing”. The correct answer must be H. 16. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: We’re really pleased that after some years away teaching, Sarah has now returned to the park and makes sure the visitors are kept fed and watered, which keeps her pretty busy as you can imagine. Explanation: Sarah is in charge of keeping the visitors “fed and watered”, indicating that her job is related to “food and drink”. The answer is F. 17. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: Our son, Duncan, has been a stalwart of the park for the last ten years, taking over from me in the area of construction… Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): building = construction Explanation: According to the speaker, Duncan has taken over from him in the area of construction, so clearly Duncan works in this area. Also, “construction” refers to “building” things, hence C is correct. 18. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: …and his new wife, Judith, has also joined the team in charge of retail. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (G): sales = retail Explanation: It is clearly stated that Judith works in the retail team.According to the dictionary, “retail” means “the sale of goods to the public in relatively small quantities for use or consumption rather than for resale” so it is quite similar to “sales”. The answer is G. 19. Answer: 120 Here’s what the speaker says: We’re also very pleased with a new installation of the Go-Kart arena which is 120 square metres in area. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (120): feature = installation size = area Explanation: the speaker gives the area of the Go-Kart arena, which is 120 m2. The answer is 120. 20. Answer: 5 to 12/ 5 -12. Here’s what the speaker says …we had to level the mounds on the tracks for safety reasons. We wanted to enable 5-12 year olds to use the go-karts. Explanation: the speaker talks about the safety of the go-kart arena, and he mentions that the idea is for children between the ages of 5 and 12 to use the go-karts. The answer is 5 to 12/ 5-12. SECTION 3 21. Answer: fishing industry. Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: First of all, you have chosen your general topic area, haven’t you? CAROLINE: Yes, it’s the fishing industry. Explanation: the speakers are discussing Caroline’s dissertation topic. Caroline tells her tutor that it will be about the fishing industry.Therefore, the answer is fishing industry. 22. Answer: statistics Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: Now, what aspects of the course are you good at? CAROLINE: Well, I think I’m coping well with statistics, and I’m never bored by it. Explanation: the tutor asks Caroline what she is good at = what are her strengths. Caroline says she is ‘coping well’ (= she is having no problem) with statistics. The answer is statistics. 23. Answer: note-taking Here’s what the speakers say: CAROLINE: You see I feel I don’t have sufficient background information. TUTOR: I see. Well, do you take notes? CAROLINE: I’m very weak at note-taking. My teachers always used to say that. TUTOR: Well I think you really need to work on these weaknesses…. Explanation: Caroline says that she does not have enough background information. The tutor suggests taking notes. However, Caroline says that she is not strong (=very weak) at note-taking. In other words, she has poor note-taking skills. The answer is note-taking. 24. Answer: confidence Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: Well, some people find it helpful to organise peer-group discussions – you know, each week a different person studies a different topic and shares it with the group. CAROLINE: Oh right TUTOR: It really helps build confidence, you know, having to present something to others. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (confidence): increase = build Explanation: the tutor suggests peer-group discussion as a way of building/increasing confidence in presenting her dissertation ideas and information. The answer is confidence. 25. Answer: idea Here’s what the speaker says: TUTOR: The drawback is that everyone in the group seems to share the same ideas….they keep being repeated in all the dissertations. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (ideas): problem = drawback Explanation: the tutor says that the problem with peer-group discussions is that the same ideas tend to be repeated all the time by members of the group. The answer is ideas. 26. Answer: support Here’s what the speaker says: TUTOR: You could also try a service called ‘Student Support’. It’s designed to give you a structured programme over a number of weeks to develop your skills. Explanation: another possible strategy for Caroline to try is to use the service provided by ‘Student Support’. This service will give her a structured programme to improve her study skills. The answer is student support. 27. Answer: places Here’s what the speakers say: CAROLINE: Sounds good. TUTOR: Yes, unfortunately there are only a few places. But it’s worth looking into. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (ideas): limited = only a few Explanation: the tutor explains that the problem with this strategy is that there are not many places available. The answer is places. 28. Answer: general Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: And then there are several study skills books that you can consult. CAROLINE: Right. TUTOR: They’ll be a good source of reference but the problem is that they are sometimes too general. Explanation: the tutor recommends another strategy – consulting books on study skills. While they are a good source of reference, they may be too general.The answer is general. 29. Answer: three times/ 3 times Here’s what the speaker says: TUTOR: Another thing I always advise is don’t just take your notes and forget about them. Read everything three times….that’ll really fix them in your mind. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (three times): all = everything Explanation: the tutor advises Caroline to make sure that she reads her notes – three times so that she will remember them. The answer is three times/3 times. 30. Answer: 25/25th/25th of Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: Well, we’ll be continuing these tutorials of course. Let’s arrange next month’s now. Let’s see. I can see you virtually any time during the week starting 22nd January. CAROLINE: What about the 24th ? I’m free in the afternoon. TUTOR: Sorry, I’m booked then. What about the following day? CAROLINE: Thursday? I can make the morning. TUTOR: Fine, we’ll go for the 25th then. Explanation: both Caroline and her tutor mention various dates and times. However, they finally decide on a date, which is 25 January. The answer is 25/25th/25th of. SECTION 4 31. Answer: B. were interested in environmental issues. Here’s what the speaker says: And one of the interesting things about this project is that the owners – both professionals but not architects – wanted to be closely involved, so they decided to manage the project themselves. Their chief aim was to create somewhere that was as environmentally-friendly as possible. But at the same time they wanted to live somewhere peaceful – they’d both grown up in a rural area and disliked urban life. Explanation: The owners wanted to manage the project themselves, so it CANNOT be that they wanted a professional project manager, hence C is incorrect. Also, it is said that they had grown up in a rural area, so A is clearly wrong. We can only tell from the recording that the owners wanted to be “environmentally-friendly”, in other words, they were “interested in environmental issues”. Therefore B is correct. 32. Answer: A. The land was quite cheap. Here’s what the speaker says: So the first thing they did was to look for a site. And they found a disused stone quarry in a beautiful area. The price was relatively low, and they liked the idea of recyclingthe land, as it were. As it was, the quarry was an ugly blot on the landscape, and it wasn’t productive any longer, either. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): extracted = quarry quite = relatively Explanation: The quarry (where stone or other materials are extracted) was “disused”, indicating that it wasn’t in use when they found the site. This means that stone could not have been being extracted; it was not productive any longer, so B is false. It is also said that “the quarry was an ugly slot on the landscape”, from which we can understand that the old quarry was extremely unattractive compared to the surrounding landscape, so the surroundings must have been quite developed, NOT “unspoilt”. Hence C is wrong as well. The correct answer is A, because the price was low, in other words, the land was cheap. 33. Answer: glass Here’s what the speaker says: The north, east and west sides were set in the earth, and only the sloping south-facing side was exposed to light. That was made of a double layer of very strong glass. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (glass): constructed = made Explanation:the speaker mentions the south-facing side of the building. As this side was ‘exposed to’ light, strong glass was used in the construction. The answer is glass. 34. Answer: insulation Here’s what the speaker says: There were also photovoltaic tiles fixed to the top and bottom of this sloping wall. These are tiles that are designed to store energy from the sun. And the walls had a layer of foam around them too, to increase the insulation. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (insulation): improve = increase Explanation:after explaining the purpose of the photovoltaic tiles, the speaker talks about the walls. The idea of the layer of foam was to increase the insulation (to stop heat escaping from the house).The answer is insulation. 35. Answer: windows Here’s what the speaker says: Now, what is of interest to us about this project is the features which make the building energy-efficient. Sunlight floods in through the glass wall, and to maximise it there are lots of mirrors and windows inside the house. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (windows): increase = maximise internal = inside Explanation:the speaker now talks about the special features of the underground house. Inside the house, there are many mirrors and windows, which maximise the light. The answer is windows. 36. Answer: electricity Here’s what the speaker says: In addition, the special tiles on the outside convert energy from the sun and generate some of the house’s electricity. In fact, and it’s possible that in future the house may even generate an electricity surplus, and that the owners will be able to sell some to the national grid. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (electricity): produce = generate more than it needs = surplus Explanation:the speaker says how efficient the house is in terms of energy – it may even produce more electricity than the owners use. This is the surplus that the speaker refers to. The answer is electricity. 37. Answer: floor(s) Here’s what the speaker says: As well as that, wherever possible, recycled materials have been used. For example, the floors are made of reclaimed wood. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (floor(s)): recycled = reclaimed Explanation:the speaker talks about the recycled materials used in the house. As an example, the floors are made of recycled/reclaimed wood.The answer is floor/floors. 38. Answer: waste Here’s what the speaker says: And then there’s the system for dealing with the waste produced in the house. This is dealt with organically…. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (waste): processing = dealing with domestically = in the house Explanation:the speaker talks about how they deal with/process the waste produced in the house, and goes on to describe how this is carried out using organic methods. The answer is waste. 39. Answer: concrete Here’s what the speaker says: It’s true that the actual construction of the house was harmful to the environment, mainly because they had to use massive amounts of concrete – one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide in manufacturing. And, as you know, this is very damaging to the environment. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (concrete): harmful = damaging Explanation:the speaker says that the construction of the house did cause some environmental problems. The use of large amounts of concrete was the main issue. The answer is concrete. 40. Answer: 15 years Here’s what the speaker says: In total, the house construction has released 70 tons of carbon dioxide into the air. Now that’s a frightening thought. However, once the initial ‘debt’ has been cleared – and it’s been calculated that this will take only fifteen years – this underground house won’t cost anything – environmentally I mean – because unlike ordinary houses, it is run in a way that is completely environmentally friendly. Explanation:the speaker talks about the environmental cost in terms of the quantity of carbon dioxide released into the air (mainly in the production of the concrete used to build the house). However, after 15 years of being run in an environmentally friendly way, this ‘carbon dioxide’ debt of this house will have been paid through the energy saved during that time. The answer is 15 years.(Remember to write one word and one number).",

Answer: town 10. Answer: shared SECTION 2 11. Answer: trees Many different … Here’s what the speakers say: – Then there’s Holt Island, which is noted for its great range of trees. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (trees): many different = wide range Explanation: We hear that the great variety of trees on Holt Island is the feature of particular interest. The answer is trees 12. Answer: Friday/Sunday Between … and … Here’s what the speakers say: – The island is only open to the public from Friday to Sunday, because it’s quite small, and if there were people around every day, much of the wildlife would keep away. Explanation: The speaker says that the island is open ‘from Friday to Sunday’, which is the same as ‘between Friday and Sunday’. So, the answer is Friday/Sunday. 13. Answer: farm Reconstruction of a 2,000-year-old … with activities for children Here’s what the speakers say: From there it’s just a short walk across the bridge to Longfield Country Park. Longfield has a modern replica of a farm from over two thousand years ago. Children’s activities are often arranged there … Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (farm): reconstruction = replica Explanation: At Longfield Country Park, there is a reconstruction (= a replica/a copy) of a farm from 2,000 years ago. The answer is farm. 14. Answer: C. dye cloth with herbs. Reconstruction of a 2,000-year-old … with activities for children Here’s what the speakers say: – On Monday you can learn about herbs, and how they’ve been used over the centuries. You’ll start with a tour of our herb garden, practise the technique of using them as colour dyes for cloth, and listen to an illustrated talk about their use in cooking and medicine. Explanation: A is incorrect since visitors will only listen to a talk about how herbs are used in cooking, NOT actually cook with herbs. B is not mentioned anywhere in the recording hence irrelevant. The correct answer must be C because the tour guide says the visitors can “practise the technique of using them as colour dyes for cloth”. The word “practise” means that they will be able to actually dye the cloth. So, the answer is C. 15. Answer: B Reconstruction of a 2,000-year-old … with activities for children Here’s what the speakers say: Then on Wednesday you can join local experts to discover the variety of insects and birds that appear in the evening. We keep to a small number of people in the group, so if you want to go you’ll need to phone the park ranger a few days ahead. There’s a small charge, which you should pay when you turn up. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): in advance = ahead Explanation: Although the word “group” is mentioned, it is not said that only group bookings are accepted. So A is incorrect – we only know that local experts will take a small group of people to watch the birds and insects. C is also incorrect because “there’s a small charge”, indicating that it won’t be free. The correct answer must be B, since the visitors who want to go on Wednesday “need to phone the park ranger a few days ahead”, with “a few days ahead” meaning “in advance”. We can understand from this that they need to call the ranger to make a booking in advance. The answer is B. 16. Answer: A. come in suitable clothing. Reconstruction of a 2,000-year-old … with activities for children Here’s what the speakers say: – You’ll have a choice of all sorts of activities, from planting hedges to picking up litter, so you’ll be able to change from one to another when you feel like it. The rangers will be hard at work all day, but do come and join in, even for just a short while. One thing, though, is to make sure you’re wearing something that you don’t mind getting dirty or torn Explanation: The visitors will have many activities to choose from when they feel like it, which means that they can do whatever activity they want. So it does not seem logical that they need to tell the rangers what they want to do before the event, as stated in C. And when you hear the phrase “a short while” you may make a connection to “the whole day”, both of which refer to time, but it is not the case. Rangers will be working hard all day, but visitors can join in – even if only for a short time. Hence B is not the answer. A is correct, because it is said that visitors should wear something they “don’t mind getting dirty or torn”, in other words, “suitable clothing”. The answer is A. 17. Answer: A bird hide Here’s what the speakers say: – And finally I’d like to tell you about our new wildlife area, Hinchingbrooke Park … you can see the two gates into the park and the main paths. As you can see, there’s a lake in the north west of the park, with a bird hide to the west of it, at the end of a path. Explanation: The speaker asks us to look for the lake. The bird hidden is at the end of the path which finishes to the west of the lake. Therefore, the bird hide is located at A. 18. Answer: I Dog-walking area Here’s what the speakers say: – Fairly close to where refreshments are available, there’s a dog-walking area in the southern part of the park, leading off from the path. Explanation: The speaker gives three instructions to locate this area: near the refreshments, in the south of the park, and near the path. The answer has to be I. 19. Answer: F Flower garden Here’s what the speakers say: – And if you just want to sit and relax, you can go to the flower garden; that’s the circular area on the map surrounded by paths. Explanation: This is not too difficult to locate. There is only one circle marked on the map, and it is surrounded by paths. The flower garden is F. 20. Answer: E Wooded area Here’s what the speakers say: – And finally, there’s a wooded area in the western section of the park, between two paths. Explanation: Looking at the west of the map, the letter ‘E’ is marked between two paths. Therefore, the answer is E. SECTION 3 21. Answer: C. it is an important part of their studies. Students want to keep the Self-Access Centre because Here’s what the speakers say: JUN: The majority of students say that they enjoy using it because it provides a variation on the classroom routine and they see it as a pretty major component of their course, but we would like to see some improvements to the equipment, particularly the computers; there aren’t enough for one each at the moment and we always have to share. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): important = major part = component Explanation: It is said that there aren’t enough computers for each student, so the variety of equipment is not great at all and the students think this should be improved. It is then pretty obvious A is not the reason why they want to keep the Centre. Although the speaker says that it is a variation on classroom routine, this only means that students enjoy the variety provided by the Centre. It does not mean that they like working on their own in general. So, B is wrong. In fact, it is due to how important the Centre is to them: “they see it as a pretty major component of their course”, which can be paraphrased into “they see it as an important part of their course”. Therefore, the answer is C. 22. Answer: B. move the Self-Access Centre elsewhere. Some teachers would prefer to Here’s what the speakers say: PAM: Well yes, the teachers agree that it is a very valuable resource but one thing we have noticed is that a lot of the students are using it to check their personal emails. We don’t want to stop you using it, but we think studentsthe computersshould be used as a learning resource, not for emails. Some of us also think that we could benefit a lot more by relocating the Self-Access Centre to the main University library building. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): move = relocate restrict = stop Explanation: The teachers say that they don’t want to stop the students from using the centre, so A is not correct. With regard to the access to the Centre’s computers, the teachers don’t think it is appropriate to use them for emails, but they don’t want to restrict the students from using the Centre: “We don’t want to stop you students using it”, hence C is wrong too. What has been suggested is that the Centre is relocated, or moved, to another building (which can be considered “elsewhere”). The answer is B. 23. Answer: B The students’ main concern about using the library would be Here’s what the speakers say: JUN: Well, the library is big enough to incorporate the Self-Access Centre, but it wouldn’t be like a class activity anymore. Our main worry would be not being able to go to a teacher for advice. I’m sure there would be plenty of things to do but we really need teachers to help us choose the best activities. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): concern = worry help = advice Explanation: The speaker says that the library would be big enough, so the size of the library is not a problem; A is incorrect. C is incorrect because it is said that “there would be plenty of things to do”, meaning there CANNOT be a lack of materials in the library. The students’ main worry (or main concern) is not being able to get advice, in other words, help from the teachers. This could be considered a difficulty. Hence B is the answer. 24. Answer: C. the difficulty in supervising the centre. The Director of Studies is concerned about Here’s what the speakers say: PAM: It’s not so much the expense that I’m worried about, and we’ve certainly got room to do it, but it’s the problem of timetabling a teacher to be in there outside class hours. If we’re going to spend a lot of money on equipment and resources, we really need to make sure that everything is looked after properly. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): cost = expense concerned = worried space = room supervise = look after Explanation: The speaker is not worried about the expense (similar to cost) – the plan is to spend a lot of money on equipment and resources, so A cannot be the answer. B is wrong as well because it is certain that there is enough room, so there can’t be a lack of space. The real concern is how to timetable a teacher to be at the Centre and look after all the expensive equipment and resources, in other words, how to assign someone to supervise the Centre. The correct answer is C. 25. Answer: reading The level of the … materials, in particular, should be more clearly shown. Here’s what the speakers say: PAM: What about other resources? Do you have a list of things that the students would like to see improved? JUN: Yes, one of the comments that students frequently make is that they find it difficult to find materials that are appropriate for their level, especially reading resources, so I think we need to label them more clearly. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (reading): in particular = especially show = label Explanation: The speaker says that students have difficulty in finding the appropriate materials for their level, so the level should be shown. The speaker refers especially to the reading resources in the Centre. The answer is reading. 26. Answer: CD Update the … collection Here’s what the speakers say: JUN: The CD section especially needs to be more current. I think we should get some of the ones that go with our latest course books and also make multiple copies. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (CD): update = be current Explanation: The speaker says that the CD section ‘needs to be more current’. It is clear that the collection should include the CDs that go with the most recent course books. The answer is CD. 27. Answer: workbooks Buy some … and divide them up Here’s what the speakers say: PAM: What do you think of the idea of introducing some workbooks? If we break them up into separate pages and laminate them, they’d be a great resource. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (workbooks): divide = break up Explanation: The speaker suggests buying some workbooks, and then using separate pages from these, laminating them and using them as a resource for students as worksheets. The answer is workbooks. 28. Answer: timetable/schedule Speak to the teachers and organise a … for supervising the centre Here’s what the speakers say: PAM: I’ll have to talk to the teachers and make sure we can all make some agreement on a timetable to supervise the centreafter class. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (timetable): speak = talk Explanation: The speaker says that she will talk to the teachers and ‘make some agreement’ (= organise) for supervising the Centre. The answer is timetable/schedule. 29. Answer: alarm Install an … Here’s what the speakers say: JUN: What about putting in an alarm? PAM: Good idea. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (alarm): install = put in Explanation: The speaker agree that it is a good idea to install an alarm for the Centre. The answer is alarm. 30. Answer: email(s) Restrict personal use of … on computers. Here’s what the speakers say: PAM: The other thing I’d like to do is to talk to our technicians and see whether we could somehow limit the access to email. I really don’t want to see that resource misused. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (email(s)): restrict = limit Explanation: Referring to the computers, the speaker says that she wants to ask the technicians to find some way to stop students using the computers for emails. The answer is email(s). SECTION 4 31. Answer: central … power source Here’s what the speakers say: The first type is called the Power Culture, and it’s usually found in small organisations. It’s the type of culture that needs a central source of power to be effective, and because control is in the hands of just one or two people there aren’t many rules or procedures. Explanation: The speaker refers to the Power Culture, which usually exists in small organisations. Control is by one or two people, so a central power source operates. The answer is central. 32. Answer: conversation/conversations Communication by … Here’s what the speakers say: Another characteristic is that communication usually takes the form of conversations rather than, say, formal meetings or written memos. Explanation: In organisations which have a Power Culture, people usually communicate by talking to each other/having conversations. The answer is conversation/conversations. 33. Answer: effectively Might not act … Here’s what the speakers say: But on the negative side, this type of organisation doesn’t always act effectively, because it depends too much on one or two people at the top…. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (effectively): disadvantage = negative side Explanation: The Power Culture has a negative side – it may not always act effectively. This happens when the one or two people at the top make bad decisions. The answer is effectively. 34. Answer: risk/risks Not afraid of … Here’s what the speakers say: And the kind of person who does well in this business culture is one who is happy to take risks, and for whom job security is a low priority. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (risk/risks): not afraid = happy Explanation: In the Power Culture, an employee who does well is prepared/happy to take risks – it’s a person who is not afraid of risk, or even losing their job The answer is risk/risks. 35. Answer: levels Large, many … Here’s what the speakers say: The next type is Role Culture … and this type is usually found in large companies, which have lots of different levels in them. Explanation: The speaker now talks about Role Culture. This is typical of large companies which have many/lots of different levels. The answer is levels. 36. Answer: description/descriptions Rules and procedure, e.g. job … and rules for discipline Here’s what the speakers say: These organisations usually have separate departments that specialise in things like finance, or sales, or maintenance, or whatever. Each one is co-ordinated at the top by a small group of senior managers, and typically everyone’s job is controlled by sets of rules and procedures – for example, there are specific job descriptions, rules for discipline, and so on. Explanation: There are usually different/specialised departments in these big organisations, and everyone has to follow certain rules and procedures. People who work there each have a job description of what they have to do in their work. The answer is description/descriptions. 37. Answer: technical Successful when … ability is important Here’s what the speakers say: What are the benefits of this kind of culture? … And secondly, it is particularly successful in business markets where technical expertise is important. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (technical): advantages = benefits ability = expertise Explanation: The speaker says that advantage of this type of culture is that it is very successful when a secondtechnical ability is important. The answer is technical. 38. Answer: change Slow to see when … is needed Here’s what the speakers say: On the other hand, this culture is often very slow to recognisethe need for change, and even slower to react. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (change): see = recognise Explanation: When we hear the speaker say ‘On the other hand….’, we now expect to hear about the disadvantages of this type of culture. The disadvantage mentioned here is that such a culture is often slow to see the need for change. The answer is change. 39. Answer: responsibility Slow to see when … is needed Here’s what the speakers say: What kind of person does this type of culture suit? Well it suits employees who value security, and who don’t particularly want to have responsibility. Explanation: The speaker gives two qualities that are typical of employees who are suited to Role Culture: they value job security, and they don’t want responsibility. The answer is responsibility. 40. Answer: flexible Slow to see when … is needed Here’s what the speakers say: Moving on to Task Cultures … Now one of the major benefits of this culture is that it is flexible. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (flexible): advantages = benefits Explanation: The speaker describes the characteristics of organisations which have a Task Culture. There is one major advantage – this type of culture is flexible. The answer is flexible.",

Answer: clear voice 8. Answer: think quickly 9. Answer: 22 October 10. Answer: Manuja SECTION 2 11. Answer: branch a new … of an international sports goods company Here’s what the speaker says: JANE: Well, most of you probably know Sports World – the branch of a Danish sports goods company that opened a few years ago – it’s attracted a lot of custom, and so the company has now decided to open another branch in the area. Explanation: Jane tells us that the company ‘Sports World’ is Danish – therefore, it is an international company. A few years ago, a branch opened in Bradcaster – but now the company is going to open another branch (= a new branch) in the area. The answer is branch. 12. Answer: west Located in the shopping centre to the … of Bradcaster Here’s what the speaker says: JANE: …the company has now decided to open another branch in the area. It’s going to be in the shopping centre, to the west of Bradcaster, so that will be good news for all of you who’ve found the original shop in the north of the town hard to get to. Explanation: Jane tells us where the new branch in the area will be located. It will be in the shopping centre, to the west of Bradcaster. She then mentions the location of the original shop, in the north of the town. Don’t be confused – it is the location of the new branch that we need to note. The answer is west. 13. Answer: clothing/clothes Has sports … and equipment on floors 1-3 Here’s what the speaker says: JANE: The first three floors have a huge range of sports clothing as well as equipment. Explanation: ‘Floors 1 – 3’ is the same as ‘the first three floors’. Here, says Jane, you can find a big range of sports clothing. The answer is clothing/clothes. 14. Answer: 10/ten Can you get any item within … days Here’s what the speaker says: JANE: If they haven’t got exactly what you want in stock, they promise to get it for you in ten days. Unlike the other store, where it can take up to fourteen days. Explanation: In the other store, they get you an item in 14 days or less. However, in the new store, they promise to get an item for you in 10 days. The answer is 10/ten. 15. Answer: running Shop specialise in equipment for … Here’s what the speaker says: JANE: They cover all the major sports, including football, tennis and swimming, but they particularly focus on running, and they claim to have the widest range of equipment in the country. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (running): specialise = focus Explanation: Jane mentions a number of sports for which the shop provides clothing and equipment – football, tennis and swimming. However, the shop has a specially wide range of clothes and equipment for running. The answer is running. 16. Answer: bags Has a special secton which just sells … Here’s what the speaker says: JANE: As well as that, a whole section of the third floor is devoted to sportsbags… Explanation: The special section which Jane refers to is on the third floor. It sells only sports bags. This is the idea of the section being ‘devoted to’ sports bags – this means that this is the only item sold in this section. The answer is bags. 17. Answer: A. on Saturday morning only. A champion athlete will be in the shop Here’s what the speaker says: JANE: The shop will be open from 9.00 am this Saturday and if you go along to the opening then you’ll have the chance to meet the national 400 metres running champion Paul King, who’s coming along to open the shop, and he will be staying around until about midday to chat to any fans who want to meet him and sign autographs. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): athlete = running Explanation: It is said that the running champion, or champion athlete, will come along to open the shop at 9 am Saturday and will stay until about midday (meaning 12 am) so we know that he will be there on Saturday morning only. The correct answer is A. 18. Answer: A. gym membership. The first person to answer 20 quiz questions correctly will win Here’s what the speaker says: JANE: There will be free tickets for local sporting events for the first 50 customers, and also a special competition open to all. Just answer fifteen out of twenty sports questions correctly to win a signed copy of Paul King’s DVD ‘Spring Tips’, while the first person to get all the questions correct gets a year’s free membership of the Bradcaster Gym. All entrants will receive a special Explanation: There are three types of prizes awarded to customers. The first is “a signed copy of Paul King’s DVD”, which can be called “a video”, given to anyone who can answer 15 out of 20 questions. So B is incorrect. Another is a special sports calendar that will be given to “all entrants”, meaning everyone who comes to the shop that weekend will receive this if they take part in the quiz. Hence, C is incorrect too. Lastly, the first person to get all the questions correct (that is 20 questions), “gets a year’s free membership of the Bradcaster Gym”. Therefore the answer must be A. 19-20.Answer: A. You need to reserve a place., E. It is cheaper this month. Which TWO pieces of information does the speaker give about the fitness test? Here’s what the speaker says: JANE: One of the special opening offers is a fitness test – a complete review of your cardiac fitness and muscle tone, actually done in the shop by qualified staff. This would normally cost £30.00 but is available at half price for this month only. There are only a limited number of places available for this, so to make a booking phone 560341. In addition, if you open an account you get lots more special offers including the chance to try out equipment at special open evenings … Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (A E): reserve a place = make a booking Explanation: According to the speaker, the fitness test will be done in the shop, so D is incorrect. The test is said to be half price this month, indicating that it is much cheaper. Hence, E is one correct answer. Another correct answer is A, because Jane, the speaker, says that the half price discounts are limited so you need to “make a booking”, which means you will need to reserve the fitness test in advance. On the other hand, B is incorrect, since account holders only get more special offers but not a free fitness test; and C is incorrect too because there is no mention of customers receiving advice on the fitness test – they only get a check of their heart and muscle condition. So, the answers are A, E. SECTION 3 21. Answer: B. his style was good. One reason why Spiros felt happy about his marketing presentation was that Here’s what the speaker says: SPIROS: I felt quite confident. Of course, I was still nervous but because I had done one before, I knew what to expect. Also, I know I was well-prepared and I had practised my timing. In fact, I think that in relation to some of the other people in my group, I did quite a good job because my overall style was quiteprofessional. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): good = professional Explanation: Spiros says that “I was still nervous” thus A is completely wrong. His performance was quite good in relation to some of the other people in his group, meaning that he was better than some, but not the best. So C is wrong too. The correct answer must be B, as Spiros’ style was “quite professional”, so we can take that as “good”. 22. Answer: C. They didn’t look at the audience enough. What surprised Hiroko about the other students’ presentations? Here’s what the speaker says: HIROKO: In my group, I was really surprised by the way the students did their presentations – they just read their notes aloud! Can you believe that? They didn’t worry about their presentation style or keeping eye contact withtheir audience – and I remember that these things were really stressed to us in the course here. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): look at = keep eye contact with Explanation: Hiroko does not say anything about how interesting (or not) the other students’ presentations were, so A is not given. B is incorrect because during the course it was emphasised/stressed that students should have a good presentation style. Do not be confused between the different meanings here of ‘stressed’(verb = emphasised) and ‘stressful’. She was just surprised that they didn’t “keep eye contact with” (the same as “look at”) the audience. So C is correct. 23. Answer: B. dissatisfied. After she gave her presentation, Hiroko felt Here’s what the speaker says: HIROKO: At the time, it was a relief to do it this way, but actually when I had finished, I didn’t feel any real sense of satisfaction. I didn’t feel positive about the experience at all. Explanation: Hiroko felt relieved “at the time”, which refers to when she was still delivering the presentation. She says that she also read aloud from her notes. But after it was done (which is what we need to focus on), she didn’t feel “any real sense of satisfaction”, in other words, she was “dissatisfied”. So the correct answer is B. 24. Answer: A. not very happy How does Spiros feel about his performance in tutorials? Here’s what the speaker says: SPIROS: You know, although I was pleased with my presentation, I am not so pleased with my actual performance right now in the tutorials – during the whole semester I’ve not said anything in our tutorial discussions. Not a word. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): not very happy = not so pleased Explanation: Be careful with answers that have the same words as in the recording. Spiros was only pleased with his presentation, but not his performance in tutorials. About his tutorials, he says: “I am not so pleased”, so it is actually A that is the correct answer. 25. Answer: C. They know each other well. Why can the other students participate so easily in discussions? Here’s what the speaker says: SPIROS: Their style of speaking is so different – it’s not the style we were used to during the course. They use so many colloquialisms, they’re not very polite and sometimes there seems to be no order in their discussion. Also, they are very familiar with each other, so because they know each other’s habits, they can let each other into the discussion. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): turns = order know (someone) well = be familiar with Explanation: Spiros says that the other students are not very polite, so A is clearly incorrect. In addition, they didn’t discuss in order, which means that they didn’t take turns and just jumped into the discussion at any time. Hence, B is also wrong. The correct answer must be C because they are said to be “familiar with each other”, in other words, they know each other really well. 26. Answer: B. She is making more of a contribution. Why is Hiroko feeling more positive about tutorials now? Here’s what the speaker says: HIROKO: But recently, I’ve been trying to speak up more and I just jump in, and I’ve noticed an interesting thing, I’ve noticed that if they thought my point was interesting or new, then the next time they actually asked for my opinion, and then it was much easier for me to be part of the discussion. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): now = recently Explanation: Be careful with answers that have the same words as in the recording. What Hiroko finds interesting is NOT others’ opinions but their reaction towards her if she says something worth noticing. So A is not the answer. And although Hiroko is now “part of the discussion”, it is not the tutor who includes her, but herself, as she is trying to speak up more, and also the other students actually ask her to give her opinion. In other words, she is “making more of a contribution”. Therefore B is correct. 27. Answer: A. consulted reference materials. To help her understand lectures, Hiroko Here’s what the speaker says: HIROKO: At first I couldn’t understand what the lecturers were talking about, so I had to turn to the books and journals. Every night I read for hours, using the lists of references that were given, and I made pages of notes. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): consult = turn to Explanation: “lecturers” are only mentioned to demonstrate the difficulty Hiroko had with understanding lectures (“I couldn’t understand what the lecturers were talking about”). However, we do not know if she had any extra tutorials with the lecturers, hence B is not given. In addition, Hiroko made the notes herself from books and journals, she didn’t borrow lecture notes from anyone, so C is incorrect. A is the answer because she says she had to “turn to” books and journals that were on reference list: (“turn to” means “to ask a person or organization for help or support”, which is similar to “consult”). The correct answer is A. 28. Answer: B. It still takes him a long time to read. What does Spiros think of his reading skills? Here’s what the speaker says: SPIROS: But I did so much reading anyway – I don’t think there’s any time left over for anything extra. My reading speed is still quite slow, though I’m much better at dealing with vocabulary than I used to be. Explanation: Spiros says he is better at dealing with vocabulary than he used to be, indicating that he used to struggle before but not anymore. Therefore C is not correct. Note that A cannot be the answer because Spiros suggests that his reading speed – both now and before – is slow, and he does not say that he now reads faster than before: his speed is still ‘quite slow’. Therefore, his reading speed is still quite slow, meaning that it takes him a quite a long time to read, so B is correct. 29. Answer: C. engineering What is Hiroko’s subject area? Here’s what the speaker says: HIROKO: Sometimes in the English class I felt frustrated when I had to read articles about the environment or health or education, because I wanted to concentrate on my own field, but we didn’t read anything about engineering. So, I think I wasted some time learning vocabulary I didn’t need. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): area = field Explanation: From what Hiroko says, it can be inferred that she wanted to read articles about her own “field” (similar to “subject area”) but she didn’t. Instead, she had to read something else that is NOT her field, which are, from the recording,environment, health andeducation. As a result, she felt frustrated. Therefore A and B are incorrect. What she wanted to read, but didn’t get the chance to read, is engineering. So C is the answer 30. Answer: B. read more in their own subject areas. Hiroko thinks that in the reading classes the students should Here’s what the speakers say: TEACHER: But surely the strategies you were taught to deal with that vocabulary were helpful. HIROKO: Yes, but psychologically speaking, I would have felt much better working on reading from my own field. Explanation: Concerning reading strategies, Hiroko agrees that what she learned from her class could be helpful, but she does not suggest that students should develop better reading strategies. So C is not given. Likewise, she does not recommend learning more vocabulary either, thus A is not the answer. What she does say is that she prefers reading from her own field, which would psychologically make her feel much better. From this we can deduce that other students should read from their own field too, according to Hiroko. Hence B is correct. SECTION 4 31. Answer: tide(s) Common in areas where the … can change quickly Here’s what the speakers say: Unfortunately, this type of event is a frequent occurrence in some of the locations that you’ll be travelling to, where sometimes the tide goes out suddenly, confusing the animals. Explanation: The speaker tells the audience that strandings often occur in some of the places that they will be travelling to. One reason why strandings occur is when the tide goes out very quickly, confusing the animals, who are then stranded on the beach. The answer is tide(s). 32. Answer: hearing/ears Some parasites can affect marine animals’ …, which they depend on for navigation Here’s what the speakers say: It’s often found that stranded animals were infested with large numbers of parasites. For instance, a type of worm is commonly found in the ears of dead whales. Since marine animals rely heavily on their hearing to navigate, this type of infestation has the potential to be very harmful. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (hearing/ears): depend on = rely on Explanation: The speaker talks about the effect of one type of parasite – a worm – which affects the hearing of marine creatures. These marine animals use their hearing to navigate, so the parasite may interfere with this, resulting in stranding. The answer is hearing/ears. 33. Answer: plants, animals/fish/fishes Poisons from … or … are commonly consumed by whales Here’s what the speakers say: Another theory is related to toxins, or poisons. These have also been found to contribute to the death of many marine animals. Many toxins, as I’m sure you’re aware, originate from plants, or animals . The whale ingests these toxins in its normal feeding behaviour, but whether these poisons directly or indirectly lead to stranding and death, seems to depend upon the toxin involved. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (plants, animals): consume = ingest Explanation: The speaker says that whales eat food which may contain toxins, as part of their normal feeding behaviour. These poisons come from (= originate from) plants or animals. The answer is plants, animals/fish/fishes. 34. Answer: feeding Unlikely because the majority of animals were not … when they stranded Here’s what the speakers say: In 1995, David Thurston monitored pilot whales that beached after following squid ashore. However, this idea does not seem to hold true for the majority of mass strandings because examination of the animals’ stomach contents reveal that most had not been feeding as they stranded. Explanation: The speaker refers to the study by David Thurston. Thurston found that most of the stranded whales that he examined had not been feeding when they became stranded. The answer is feeding. 35. Answer: noise(s) … from military tests are linked to some recent strandings. Here’s what the speakers say: A growing concern is that loud noises in the ocean cause strandings. Noises such as those caused by military exercisesare of particular concern and have been pinpointed as the cause of some strandings of late. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (noise(s)): test = exercise linked to = pinpointed as the cause recent = of late Explanation: The speaker refers specifically to noise resulting from military tests as being the cause of some recent strandings. The answer is noise(s). 36. Answer: healthy Were all … Here’s what the speakers say: There were several factors which made this stranding stand out as different from previous strandings. This led researchers to look for a new cause. For one, all the stranded animals were healthy. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (healthy): unusual = different Explanation: The speaker talks about the Bahamas stranding of 2000. One factor about this stranding is that all the whales were healthy. The answer is healthy. 37. Answer: group Were not in a … Here’s what the speakers say: In addition, the animals were spread out along 38 kilometres of coast, whereas it’s more common for the animals to be found in a group when mass strandings occur. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (healthy): unusual = different Explanation: The speaker says that the animals were not found in one area, they were ‘spread out’ along the coast. Normally, mass strandings occur as a group in one area. This finding is linked to the new theories about the effects of noise on strandings. The answer is group. 38. Answer: social More strandings in the most … species of whales Here’s what the speakers say: A final theory is related to group behaviour, and suggests that sea mammals cannot distinguish between sick and healthy leaders and will follow sick leaders, even to an inevitable death. This is a particularly interesting theory since the whales that are thought to be most social – the toothed whales – are the group that strand the most frequently. Explanation: The speaker now talks about group behaviour, and the fact that sea mammals do not know if the leader of their group is sick or healthy. A sick leader may lead the group to their death by stranding. This theory is supported by the fact that the most social of all the species of whales – the toothed whales – are also group that strand most often. The answer is social. 39. Answer: leader 1994 dolphin stranding – only the … was ill Here’s what the speakers say: The theory is also supported by evidence from a dolphin stranding in 1994. Examination of the dead animals revealed that apart from the leader, all the others had been healthy at the time of their death. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (leader): only = apart from Explanation: The theory that the most social species of sea mammals strand the most frequently is supported by a stranding of dolphins investigated in 1994. Only the leader was sick. Apart from (= except for) the leader, all the other dolphins that were stranded were healthy. The answer is leader. 40. Answer: networks Marine Mammals Ashore (Connor) – gives information about stranding … Here’s what the speakers say: Without one consistent theory, however, it is very hard for us to do anything about this phenomenon, except to assist animals where and when we can. Stranding networks have been established around the world to aid in rescuing animals and collecting samples from those that could not be helped. I recommend John Connor’s Marine Mammals Ashore as an excellent starting point if you’re interested in finding out more about these networks, or establishing one yourself. Explanation: The speaker says that, until we can get more information to support a consistent theory, we can only try to help the stranded animals – or to collect samples from dead animals. People who want to help have formed stranding networks all over the world, and Connor’s book gives details of these networks. The answer is networks.",

Answer: urwin 9. Answer: 12.00(pm)/noon/mid-day 10. Answer: reference SECTION 2 11. Answer: A. pedestrian safety. Here’s what the speaker says: GRAHAM: Yes, we’ve tried to address some of the concerns that local groups told us about. People we’ve heard from are mainly worried about traffic in the area, and, in particular, the increasing speed of cars near schools. They feel that it is only a matter of time before there is an accident as a lot of the children walk to the school. So we’re trying to do something about that. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): community groups = local groups concerned about = worried about Explanation:the speaker says that local groups are mainly worried about traffic, but not traffic jams as stated in B. C is also wrong, because the speaker does not mention pollution here. They are actually concerned about the high chance of an accident happening to children who walk (in other words, “pedestrians”) to school, because cars are travelling very fast. Therefore, the answer is A. 12. Answer: B. buried. Here’s what the speakers says: GRAHAM: Another area of concern is the overhead power lines. These are very old and a lot of people we spoke to asked if something could be done about them. Well, I’m happy to report that the power company have agreed tomove the power lines underground at a cost of $800,000. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): buried = underground Explanation: The speaker clearly says that the power lines will be moved underground, which means they will be buried. The correct answer is B. 13. Answer: B. the power company. Here’s what the speakers say: CAROL: That’s good to know, but will that mean an increase in rates for the local businesses in that area? GRAHAM: Well, the power company have agreed to bear the cost of this themselves after a lot of discussion with the council. This is wonderful news as the council now has some extra funds for us to put into other things like tree planting and art work. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): expenses = cost Explanation: One speaker (Carol) thinks that the cost might lead to “an increase in rates for the local businesses”, which means businesses will have to pay the costs of moving the power lines underground (because they will have to pay for higher rates). However, Graham – the other speaker – says that, the power company will “bear the cost themselves” so the answer is actually B. The power company have agreed to pay after discussion with the council, leaving the council free to spend its money on other things. Therefore, neither local businesses nor the council will pay for this work – the power company will “bear the cost” = pay for it. The answer is B. 14. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: GRAHAM: And on the map we’ve marked the proposed changes. Firstly, we’ll plant mature pine trees to provide shelter and shade just to the right of the supermarket in Days Road. Explanation: The large building shown in the map on Days Road must be the supermarket. Just to the right of that building, the letter ‘C’ is marked. Therefore, the tree planting site must be C. 15. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: GRAHAM: In order to address the traffic problems, the pavements on the corner of Carberry and Thomas Street will be widened. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (D): footpath = pavement Explanation: if we find on the map the corner of Carberry Street and Thomas Street (the junction of the two streets), we find the letter ‘D’ marked. The answer is D. 16. Answer: G Here’s what the speaker says: GRAHAM: We think it’s very important to separate the local residential streets from the main road. So the roadway at the entry to Thomas Street from Days Road will be painted red. This should mark it more clearly and act as a signal for traffic to slow down. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (G): road = roadway Explanation: if we locate the entrance to Thomas Street from Days Road, the letter ‘G’ is marked at the junction. This is the part of the road that will be ‘coloured’/painted red. The answer is G. 17. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: GRAHAM: One way of making sure that the pedestrians are safe is to increase signage at the intersections. A ‘keep clear’ sign will be erected at the junction of Evelyn Street and Hill Street, to enable traffic to exit at all times. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): sign = signage Explanation: find the intersection (= junction) of Evelyn Street and Hill Street. The letter ‘B’ is marked here on the map. The answer is B. 18. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: GRAHAM: Something we’re planning to do to help control the flow of traffic in the area is to install traffic lights half way down Hill Street where it crosses Days Road. Explanation: on the map, find Hill Street. It is a long street, but you can see where Days Road crosses Hill Street. This is where traffic lights will be placed, marked as letter ‘F’ on the map. The answer is F. 19. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: GRAHAM: We’re going to get school children in the area to research a local story, the life of a local sports hero perhaps, and an artist will incorporate that story into paintings on the wall of a building on the other side of Hill Street from the supermarket. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): artwork = paintings Explanation: the speaker explains that an artist will do paintings on the wall of a building. He mentions ‘the other side of Hill Street from the supermarket’. On the map, this is marked with the letter ‘A’. The answer is A. 20. Answer: E Here’s what the speaker says: GRAHAM: And finally, we’ve agreed to build a new children’s playground which will be at the other end of Hill Street close to the intersection with Carberry Street. Explanation: at the other end of Hill Street from the artwork/wall painting, we find the junction/intersection with Carberry Street. Here we find the letter ‘E’ marked – the site of the new children’s playground. The answer is E. SECTION 3 21-22 Answer: B. His family are willing to help him., E. A former employer is providing partial funding. Here’s what the speakers say: DAN: It was practically a year ago that I applied to my local council for a grant, and it took them six months to turn me down. JEANNIE: That’s really slow. DAN: And I thought I was eligible for government funding, but it seems I was mistaken. So then I asked the boss of the company I used to work for if they would sponsor me, and much to my surprise, he said they’d make acontribution.’ JEANNIE: But what about college grants and scholarships? There must be some you could apply for. DAN: Yes, there are, but they’re all so small that I decided to leave them until I was desperate. JEANNIE: Uhuh. DAN: And in fact I didn’t need to apply. My parents had been saying that as I already had a job, I ought to support myself through college. But in the end they took pity on me, so now I’ve just about got enough. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (B E): employer = boss former = used to family = parents Explanation: Dan says that he got turned down by the local council, meaning that they refused to give him support. Thus, D is wrong. Also, he thought he had been eligible for government funding, but it didn’t turn out that way – he was mistaken. From this we can infer that Dan wasn’t eligible, so of course the government didn’t give him any money. So A is wrong as well. Regarding college grants, Dan didn’t apply because he thought they were too small, (although he may apply later). Hence C is not the answer. In fact, he got money from his former boss (the same as “employer”) who said he would “make a contribution”, indicating he would support Dan with partial, not all, the funding. So E is correct. Another source where Dan got money from is his parents. (They said Dan should support himself but then “took pity” on him, which means that they changed their mind and gave him some money because they felt sorry for him). Therefore another answer is B. In conclusion, B and E are correct. 23-24 Answer: A. She is not sufficiently challenged., C. She does not have enough time. Here’s what the speakers say: JEANNIE: Yes, I’m in the drama club. It’s our first performance next week, so we’re rehearsing frantically, and I’ve got behind with my work, but it’s worth it. I’m hoping to be in the spring production, too. DAN: I’ve never liked acting. Are you doing anything else? JEANNIE: I enjoyed singing when I was at school, so I joined a group when I came to college. I don’t think the conductor stretches us enough, though so I’ll give up after the next concert. And I also joined the debating society. It’s fun, but with all the rehearsing I’m doing, something has to go, and I’m afraid that’s the one. DAN: Do you do any sports? JEANNIE: Yes, I’m in one of the hockey teams. I’m not very good, but I’d really miss it if I stopped. I decided to try tennis when I came to college, and I’m finding it pretty tough going. I’m simply not fit enough. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (A C): leave = give up Explanation: Jeannie says she is behind her work due to the drama club’s frantic rehearsal schedule, so we know that this club activity “interferes with her studies”. However, she doesn’t want to quit the drama club (in fact, she even wants to be in another production later on) so B cannot be the reason. Likewise, with the hockey team, Jeannie thinks she is not good, but she would miss it if she stopped, from which we can tell that she isn’t going to quit this activity. Thus, E is a wrong answer. And she says that she is not fit enough for tennis, in other words, tennis is “too demanding physically”, but it is not mentioned that she joined a tennis club, we only know that she plays tennis and she does not talk about quitting, so D is not the answer either. However, we know that Jeannie will leave the singing group and the debating society. In the singing group, the conductor does not stretch her enough (meaning “she is not sufficiently challenged”). Although the debating society is fun, she has so much rehearsing to do for the drama club, there is not enough time left to take part in everything. She has decided that the debating society activity ‘has to go’, which means that she will quit.Therefore, A and C are the correct answers. 25. Answer: C. The preparation for seminars takes too much time. Here’s what the speaker says: DAN: All those people saying clever things that I could never think of – it’s quite interesting, but I wonder if I’m clever enough to be doing this course. Explanation: Dan feels that he may be not clever enough compared to other students, because they say clever things he could never think of. This means that he feels “inferior” (meaning “lower in rank, status or quality”). Hence, B is correct. 26. Answer: C Here’s what the speakers say: DAN: How do you get on with your tutor? I don’t think I’m on the same wavelength as mine, so I feel I’m not getting anything out of the tutorials. It would be more productive to read a book instead. JEANNIE: Oh, mine’s very demanding. She gives me lots of feedback and advice, so I’ve got much better at writing essays. And she’s helping me plan my revision for the end-of-year exams. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): challenging = demanding develop = got better Explanation: The one who feels that tutorials aren’t very helpful or efficient is Dan (“I feel I’m not getting anything out of the tutorials”) NOT Jeannie, so A is clearly incorrect. Jeannie does say that her tutor is very demanding, which can mean that her tutor is “challenging”, but we don’t know if her tutor is more demanding than she expected. She does not say. Hence, we cannot say that the tutor is more challenging than Jeannie expected; B is also incorrect. In fact, the tutor has helped her to get better with her writing skills and to plan her revision before the exam. This indicates that Jeannie has developed her study skills thanks to the tutorials. The answer is C. 27. Answer: priorities Here’s what the speakers say: DAN: Mm. Would it help to get hold of some past papers? JEANNIE: Yes. They’ll help make it clear. DAN: Right, I’ll do that. Then what? JEANNIE: Then you can sort of your revision priorities, based on what’s likely to come up. I put these on a card and read them through regularly. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (priorities): work out = sort out Explanation: Jeannie says that after Dan has found (‘got hold of’) some past exam papers, he should decide on (‘sort out’) his priorities for revision, and write these on a card. The answer is priorities. 28. Answer: timetable Here’s what the speaker says: JEANNIE: You also need a timetable, to see how you can fit everything in, in the time available. Then keep it in front of you while you’re studying. Explanation: next, Jeannie says that a timetable is necessary, which you should keep in front of you (‘keep in view’) when you are studying. The answer is timetable. 29. Answer: small tasks Here’s what the speaker says: JEANNIE: Maybe you need to do something different every day, so if you break down your revision into small tasks, and allocate them to specific days, there’s more incentive to tackle them. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (small tasks): divide = break down Explanation: Jeannie explains the idea that if you divide revision into small tasks, it becomes easier and you are more motivated to tackle them. The answer is (small) tasks. 30. Answer: (single) paraghraph Here’s what the speaker says: JEANNIE: And as I revise each topic I write a single paragraph about it – then later I can read it through quickly. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (paragraph): one = a single Explanation: Jeannie now mentions writing something – a single paragraph about each topic. The answer is (single) paragraph. SECTION 4 31. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: However, they didn’t go as far as the Modern style, which is known as ‘x-ray’ because it actually makes a feature of the internal skeleton as well as the organs of animals and humans. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): bones = skeleton Explanation: It is said that the Modern style features the “internal skeleton” (in other words, “bones”) of figures of animals, so C is the correct answer. 32. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: The Yam style of painting got its name from the fact that it featured much curvier figures that actually resemble the vegetable called a yam, which is similar to a sweet potato. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): rounded = curvier Explanation: The figures in Yam style are curvy (in other words, “rounded”) so B is clearly the answer. 33. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: The Modern paintings are interesting because they include paintings at the time of the first contact with European settlers. Aborigines managed to convey the idea of the settlers’ clothing by simply painting the Europeans without any hands, indicating the habit of standing with their hands in their pockets! Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): missing = without Explanation: It is stated that the Modern paintings show figures “without any hands”, so this can be considered as “parts missing” (the parts refer to the Europeans’ hands). The answer is C. 34. Answer: A Here’s what the speaker says: The more recent images tend to be life size or even larger, but the Dynamic figures are painted in miniature. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): smaller = miniature Explanation: The speaker clearly says that Dynamic figures are “miniature” (meaning “of a much smaller size than normal”) as opposed to recent images that are usually life size. From this we can understand that Dynamic figures are much smaller than the life size. The answer is A. 35. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: In fact, fish didn’t start to appear in paintings until the Yam period along with shells and other marine images. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): sea = marine Explanation: “sea creatures”, or “marine creatures”, refer to things like fish and shells, etc. which appear in the Yam period. Therefore the answer must be B. 36. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: In fact, fish didn’t start to appear in paintings until the Yam period along with shells and other marine images. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): sea = marine Explanation: “sea creatures”, or “marine creatures”, refer to things like fish and shells, etc. which appear in the Yam period. Therefore the answer must be B. 37. Answer: animal Here’s what the speaker says: The Rainbow Serpent, which is the focus of my most recent project, gets its name from its snake or serpent-like body and it first appeared in the Yam period 4 to 6,000 years ago. Many believe it is a curious mixture of kangaroo, snake and crocodile. But we decided to study the Rainbow Serpent paintings to see if we could locate the animal that the very first painters based their image on. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (animal/creature): identify = locate Explanation:the speaker talks about the most recent project – the study of the Rainbow Serpent paintings. Some people think that they are a mixture of kangaroo, snake and crocodile. The aim of the project is to identify exactly which animal the paintings represent (‘based their image on’). The answer is animal. 38. Answer: sea level(s)/water level(s). Here’s what the speaker says: The Yam period coincided with the end of the last ice age. This brought about tremendous change in the environment, with the sea levels rising and creeping steadily inland. Explanation:In this period, the big environmental change was higher sea levels (= ‘sea levels rising’) and the sea moving inland. The answer is sea level(s)/water level(s). 39. Answer: hunting Here’s what the speaker says: This flooded many familiar land features and also caused a great deal of disruption to traditional patterns of life, hunting in particular. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (hunting): activities = patterns of life Explanation:the floods caused by rising sea levels affected (= ‘caused a great deal of disruption to’) the traditional way of life of the aborigines. In particular, it became more difficult to hunt animals in the traditional way. The answer is hunting. 40. Answer: creation Here’s what the speaker says: Even today, Aborigines see the Rainbow Serpent as a symbol of creation… Explanation:because a lot of vegetation (plants) and animals appeared at this time, including sea creatures of course, in the flooded areas, aboriginal culture saw the Rainbow Serpent as a symbol of the creation of all this new life. The answer is creation.",

      "content_clean": "SECTION 1 1. Answer: central Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: What about the location? MAN: It’d be nice to be central . Explanation: When the man says that “It’d be nice…”, this means that he prefers a central location. The answer is central. 2. Answer: 600 Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: What’s your upper limit for the rent? MAN: We’d like something around £500 a month, but we could go up to £600 if we have to. But we can’t go beyond that. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (600): maximum = upper limit Explanation: Be careful here. The man first mentions £500, but then he gives the maximum rent that he can afford – £600. The answer is 600. 3. Answer: 2 years Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: Do you know how long you want to rent the house for? The minimum let is six months, as you probably realise. MAN: We’re at college here for two years, and we don’t want to have to move during that time if we can avoid it. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (2 years): let = rent Explanation: Although the woman says that the minimum period for which you can rent the house is six months, the man says that they want to rent for two years. The answer is 2 years. (Remember to write one number and one word – look at the instructions). 4. Answer: garage Here’s what the speaker says: WOMAN: There’s this one in Oakington Avenue, at £550 a month. Combined living room and dining room, with a separate kitchen. It doesn’t have a garage, though you can park in the road. Explanation: the woman gives a description of the house and the rent in Oakington Avenue. She then states the problem – there is no garage. The answer is garage. 5. Answer: garden Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: Right. Then have a look at this house, in Mead Street. It’s got a very large living room and kitchen, bathroom, cloakroom…. MAN: How much is it? WOMAN: That one’s 580. It’s very well furnished and equipped. It also has plenty of space for parking, and it’s available for a minimum of a year. Oh, and there’s a big garden . MAN: I don’t think we could cope with that, to be honest. We’ll be too busy to look after it. Explanation: the house in Mead Street, has a big garden. However, the man says that they will be too busy to care for the garden. In other words, the garden is too big. The answer is garden. 6. Answer: study Here’s what the speaker says: WOMAN: Okay. Then there’s this older house in Hamilton Road: living room, kitchen-diner, and it has a study. 550 a month. Explanation: the woman describes the accommodation in Hamilton Road. The room required by the question is the study. The answer is study. 7. Answer: noisy Here’s what the speakers say: MAN: That looks rather nice. But whereabouts in Hamilton Road? WOMAN: Towards the western end. MAN: Oh, that’ll be very noisy. I know the area. Explanation: they continue to discuss the house in Hamilton Road. The problem is the location – at the western end of the road. It is too noisy. The answer is noisy. 8. Answer: 595 Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: Well, what about this house in Devon Close? MAN: That looks lovely. WOMAN: There’s a big demand for houses in that area, so prices tend to be quite high. But this one hasn’t been decorated for a few years, which has kept the rent down a bit. It’s got a living room, dining room and small kitchen, and it’s 595 a month. I think it would suit you, from what you’ve said. MAN: It sounds fine. Explanation: they agree that the house in Devon Close might be OK. The woman says that the rent is 595 a month. The answer is 595. 9 and 10. Answer: B. concert hall, E. swimming pool Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: There’s a big sports centre under construction, which will be very impressive when it’s finished. In fact the swimming pool’s already opened, ahead of schedule, and it’s attracting a lot of people. MAN: What about cinemas: are there any in the area? WOMAN: The only one closed down last year, and it’s now in the process of being converted into a film museum. The local people are trying to get a new cinema added to the scheme. MAN: I think I heard something about a plan to replace the existing concert hall with a larger one. WOMAN: Ah, that’s due to start next year. Explanation: The woman says that the sports centre is under construction, so it is not available at present. Neither are the cinema and museum, because it is said that the cinema is being converted into the museum, indicating both of these are not open to the public. Hence, A, C and D are incorrect answers. Meanwhile, “the swimming pool’s already opened” so E is correct. Besides, the concert hall will be replaced NEXT YEAR, which means that it is still open at the moment. B is also correct. The answers are B, E. SECTION 2 11. Answer: classical music, (classical/music) concerts. Here’s what the speaker says: And today the focus is on The National Arts Centre. Now, if you don’t already know it yourself, I’m sure you’ve all heard of it. It’s famous throughout the world as one of the major venues for classical music. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (classical music): well known = famous Explanation: the speaker explains that the Centre is famous as a place/venue for classical music concerts. The answer is classical music, (classical/music) concerts. 12. Answer: bookshop/bookstore Here’s what the speaker says: But did you know that it is actually much more than just a place to hear concerts? The Centre itself is a huge complex that caters for a great range of arts. Under a single roof it houses concert rooms, theatres, cinemas, art galleries and a wonderful public library, as well as service facilities including three restaurants and a bookshop. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (bookshop): consists of = houses (verb) Explanation: the speaker mentions all the things listed. These are part of the range of arts in the Centre. The final item on the list is a bookshop. The answer is bookshop/bookstore. 13. Answer: planned Here’s what the speaker says: Well the area was completely destroyed by bombs during the war in 1940. So the opportunity was taken to create a cultural centre that would be, what they called: ‘the City’s gift to the Nation’. Of course it took a while for such a big project to get started, but it was planned in the 60s, built in the 70s…… Explanation: giving the historical background to the Centre, the speaker explains what happened to the area during the war, and then says that the project was planned in the 60s and built in the 70s. So, the missing piece of information is that it was planned in this period (the 60s – 70s), and then built. The answer is planned. 14. Answer: 1983 Here’s what the speaker says: …it was planned in the 60s, built in the 70s and eventually opened to thepublic in 1983. Explanation: continuing to talk about the history of the Centre, the speaker then gives the date when it was opened – 1983. The answer is 1983. 15. Answer: city council Here’s what the speaker says: It is not privately owned, like many arts centres, but is still in public hands – it’s run by the City Council. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (City Council): managed = run Explanation: the speaker says that the Centre is ‘still in public hands’ – it is not owned by a private company. It is managed by the City Council. The answer is City Council. 16. Answer: 363 Here’s what the speaker says: Both our National Symphony Orchestra and National Theatre Company were involved in the planning of the project, and they are now based there – giving regular performances every week – and as the Centre is open 363 daysof the year, there are plenty of performances to choose from. Explanation: this is a straightforward question to test your listening abilities. The speaker says that the Centre is open 363 days per year. The answer is 363. 17. Answer: (the) Garden Hall Here’s what the speaker says: If you’re interested in classical music, then we recommend you go along to the National on either Monday or Tuesday evening at 7.30 for a spectacular production of ‘The Magic Flute’ – probably the most popular of all Mozart’s operas. It’s in the Garden Hall and tickets start at only £8.00. Explanation: the venue is the place where the event takes place. So, the speaker says that the opera is in the Garden Hall. The answer is (the) Garden Hall. 18. Answer: Three Lives Here’s what the speaker says: For those more interested in the cinema, you might like to see the new Canadian film which is showing on Wednesday evening at 8 p.m. in Cinema 2. And that’s called ‘Three Lives’. Explanation: the speaker gives the name of this Canadian film as ‘Three Lives’. The answer is ‘Three Lives’. 19. Answer: 4.50 Here’s what the speaker says: It’s had fantastic reviews and tickets cost just £4.50, which is a reduction on the usual price of £5.50. Explanation: You have to listen carefully, as two ticket prices are given for the film. Although, the usual price is £5.50, the tickets are reduced to only £4.50. So, the answer is 4.50 20. Answer: Faces of China Here’s what the speaker says: …on Saturday and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. , they’re showing a wonderful new exhibition that hasn’t been seen anywhere else in Europe yet. It’s a collection of Chinese art called ‘Faces of China’ – that’s in Gallery 1… Explanation: the speaker talks about the exhibition of Chinese art in Gallery 1 on Saturday and Sunday evening, giving the title: ‘Faces of China’. The answer is ‘Faces of China’. SECTION 3 21. Answer: C. to learn about Latin American life. Here’s what the speakers say: PAUL: Well, as I’m combining Spanish with Latin American studies, mymain idea was to find out more about the way people lived there. My spoken Spanish was already pretty good in fact. WOMAN: So you weren’t too worried about language barriers? PAUL: No. In fact, I ended up teaching English there, although that wasn’t my original choice of work. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): learn = find out Explanation: Paul says that his Spanish was already pretty good before he went to South America, so he didn’t go there to improve his Spanish, therefore B is wrong. And although he worked as an English teacher there, that wasn’t his ORIGINAL choice of work, meaning that he went there with a different job in mind. Hence, A is also wrong. What he wanted was to “find out more about the way people lived”, or (in other words) to learn about Latin American life. The answer is C. 22. Answer: C. tourism Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: You mean construction? Engineering work? PAUL: Yes, getting involved in building projects was an option. Then there was tourism – taking tourists for walks around the volcanoes – which I actuallychose to do, and then there was work with local farmers. Explanation: All three work options are mentioned by Paul, but he says that he chose tourism, meaning that he intended to do it. So the correct answer must be C. 23. Answer: A. His first job was not well organised. Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: But you didn’t continue with that project. Why not? PAUL: Because I never really knew whether I’d be needed or not. I’d thought it might be difficult physically, but I was certainly fit enough . . . no, I wanted to do something that had more of a proper structure to it, I suppose. I get de-motivated otherwise. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): demanding = difficult Explanation: Answer C is wrong because he says that he was “certainly fit enough” so that couldn’t be the reason why he left. So, the work was not physically too difficult. There is no mention of routines, so B is not correct. The truth is that he wanted “to do something that had more of a proper structure to it”, which indicates that the first job didn’t have a proper structure, in other words it was not well organized. The correct answer is A. 24. Answer: B. develop trust. Here’s what the speakers say: PAUL: Yes, but it was difficult at first to be accepted by the locals. It was a very remote village and some of them were reluctant to speak to me – although they were always interested in my clothes and how much I’d had to pay for them. (…) What struck me was that when people became more comfortable with me and less suspicious, we really connected with each other in a meaningful way. WOMAN: You made good friends? PAUL: Yes, with two of the families in particular. Explanation: At first, Paul couldn’t get along with the villagers (it was difficult to be accepted) but after some time, the locals were more comfortable and less suspicious towards him. This means that at the beginning they were really suspicious with Paul being a stranger, in other words, they didn’t trust him. So Paul must have learnt the importance of developing trust. The correct answer is B. The other two are just irrelevant to the actual recording. 25. Answer: C. He was very supportive of Paul. Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: Good. What about management. Did you have a project manager? PAUL: Yes and he gave me lots of advice and guidance. WOMAN: And was he good at managing too? PAUL: That wasn’t his strong point! I think he was often more interested in the academic side of things than filing reports. He was a bit of a dreamer. Explanation: Regarding his project manager, Paul says that he gave him lots of advice and guidance, which means he was “very supportive”, hence C is the correct answer. There is no mention about how much work he let Paul do, or how ambitious he was, so A and B are not given. The answer is C. 26. Answer: A. a computer to use. Here’s what the speakers say: PAUL: I had to stay for a minimum of three months. My parents were surprised when I asked to stay longer – six months in the end. I was so happy there. WOMAN: And did anything on the administration side of things surprise you? What was the food and lodging like? PAUL: Simple . . . but there was plenty to eat and I only paid seven dollars a day for that which was amazing really. And they gave me all the equipment Ineeded . . . even a laptop. WOMAN: You didn’t expect that then? PAUL: No. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): computer = laptop Explanation: Paul asked to stay longer himself, so he wasn’t given a contract extension. Thus, C is wrong. In addition, Paul didn’t receive any money to live on, he paid for the living expenses himself (“I only paid seven dollars a day for that”), so B is wrong too. The correct answer should be A, because Paul didn’t expect to be given a laptop, so of course he would be surprised. The answer is A. 27. Answer: C Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: It looks at how gender analysis is reconfiguring civil society in Latin America. Women are increasingly occupying positions in government and in other elected leadership positions in Latin America. I think you’d find it interesting. PAUL: If it was to do with people in the villages rather than those in the public sphere, I would. Explanation: Paul says that he would do this module “If it was to do with people in the villages rather than those in the public sphere”, so some may think he will do this. The actual meaning of what he says is quite different though. From what the woman says, we know that the module is a study of women who are occupying positions in government and in other elected leadership positions in Latin America, which refers to those “in the public sphere”. This module, therefore, is not concerned with people in the villages. It focuses on people in government positions (= in the public sphere). Therefore, Paul says he will not do this module. The correct answer is C. 28. Answer: A Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: Okay. What about Second Language Acquisition? PAUL: Do you think I’d find that useful? WOMAN: Well, you’ve had some practical experience in the field, I think it would be. PAUL: I hadn’t thought about that. I’ll put that down as a definite, then. Explanation: Paul says that he will note this module (= ‘put that down’) as“a definite”, meaning that he will definitely do this. The answer is clearly A. 29. Answer: B Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: Okay. What about Indigenous Women’s Lives. That sounds appropriate. PAUL: I thought so too, but I looked at last year’s exam questions and that changed my mind. WOMAN: Don’t judge the value of the course on that. Maybe, talk to some other students first and we can talk about it again later. PAUL: Okay. Explanation: At first Paul didn’t want to do the Indigenous Women’s Lives module (because of last year’s exam questions), but then he agreed with the woman that they would talk about it later. This means that Paul hasn’t decided whether he will take this course or not, so the answer is B. 30. Answer: C Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: And lastly, will you sign up for Portuguese lessons? PAUL: My Spanish is good, so would I find that module easy? WOMAN: Not necessarily. Some people find that Spanish interferes with learning Portuguese… getting the accent right too. It’s quite different in a lot of ways. PAUL: Well, I’d much sooner do something else, then. Explanation: The woman tells Paul that some students find that learning Portuguese is not a good idea. If they already know Spanish then, because the languages are similar, students may become confused. Paul follows this advice and agrees that it would be better to do a different module (= ‘I’d much sooner do something else’). He won’t do this module. Hence, C is the answer. SECTION 4 31. Answer: B. more frequent. Here’s what the speaker says: The goal, then, is to utilise existing knowledge and not to generate new knowledge. It’s a less glamorous activity than pure innovation, but it actuallyhappens more often, as a matter of fact. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): frequent = often introduce = generate Explanation: According to the speaker, in business utilizing existing knowledge happens more often, or more frequently, than generating new knowledge. Thus, B is the correct answer. 32. Answer: B. produced consistent findings. Here’s what the speaker says: Now, there’s been a lot of research into how companies can repeat their previous successes, and it certainly hasn’t been confined to the United States. It seems that most large industries are trying to repeat their own successes, and manage the knowledge they’ve acquired – but even so it has been shown that the overwhelming majority of attempts fail. A host of studies confirm this, covering a wide range of business settings: branch banks, retail stores, real estate agencies, factories, call centres . . . to name but a few. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): research = studies repetition = repeat Explanation: According to the speaker, research “hasn’t been confined to the US”, indicating that it has been done both in the US and in other places, but it does not mean MOST research has been done outside America. Hence A is incorrect. The research covered a wide range of business, which is the opposite of “a few contexts” so C is wrong. It is said that “A host of studies confirm this”, with “this” referring to the finding that the majority of attempts to repeat success failed. From this we can understand that many studies have led to the same results, in other words, “consistent findings”. The correct answer is B. 33. Answer: B. It can be useful in certain circumstances. Here’s what the speaker says: Managers who want to apply existing knowledge typically start off by going to an expert – such as the person who designed and is running a successful department store – and picking their brains. Now, this approach can be used ifyou want to gain a rough understanding of a particular system, or understand smaller, isolated problems. Explanation: It is said that managers typically start off by going to an expert. The word “typically” indicates that most managers do this, so A is clearly wrong. C is not mentioned, thus irrelevant. The correct answer is B, because according to the speaker, “this approach”, which refers to consulting experts, can be used in certain circumstances, for example “if you want to gain a rough understanding of a particular system, or understand smaller, isolated problems”. The answer is B. 34. Answer: A. some details are difficult for workers to explain. Here’s what the speaker says: The expert never has complete access to the necessary information. And the situation’s complicated even further by the fact that experts are usually not aware of their own ignorance. The ignorance can take various forms. For instance, a lot of details of the system are invisible to managers. Some may be difficult to describe – learned on the job and well known by workers perhaps, but impossible to describe in a way that’s helpful. And there are some things that people know or do that they’re not even aware of. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): explain = describe difficult = impossible Explanation: The experts may not know everything about their operation (“a lot of details of the system are invisible to managers”), which means that managers are not even aware of certain details. These details are well known by workers who directly work with them, but not easily understood by the managers who have more to worry about than the details of particular systems. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Note that B and C are incorrect because there is no mention made of how workers may hide or alter the details to their boss. The answer is A. 35. Answer: combination Here’s what the speaker says: Now let’s consider two types of mistake that can occur when a manager actually starts to set up a duplicate system to replicate a successful process. Firstly, perhaps he forgets that he was just trying to copy another process, and starts trying to improve on it. Another mistake is trying to use the best parts of various different systems, in the hope of creating the perfect combination. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (combination/system): several = various processes = systems ideal = perfect Explanation:the speaker talks about the two mistakes that a manager may make. The second mistake is to combine things from different processes to try to make some perfect/ideal process. The answer is combination. 36. Answer: safety Here’s what the speaker says: More typically, the advantages are real enough, but there are also disadvantages that have been overlooked. For example, the modifications might compromise safety in some way. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (safety): changes = modifications Explanation:the speaker mentions two possible causes of problems and then talks about the problem of overlooking disadvantages. Some changes made to processes might have the effect of being dangerous = compromising safety. The answer is safety. 37. Answer: attitude(s) Here’s what the speaker says: …the underlying problem has more to do with attitudes than the actual difficulty of the task, and there are ways of getting it right. These involve adjusting attitudes, first of all…. being more realistic and cautious really. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (attitudes): change = adjust Explanation:the speaker now talks about solutions to these problems. One solution is the attitudes of managers. They should change these attitudes and be more cautious and realistic. The answer is attitude(s). 38. Answer: control(s) Here’s what the speaker says: Secondly, they involve exerting strict controls on the organisational and operational systems. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (controls): impose = exert rigorous = strict Explanation:a second solution proposed by the speaker is to put strict controls on the operating and organisational systems. Therefore, the answer is control(s). 39. Answer: factory/factories Here’s what the speaker says: And this in turn means copying the original as closely as possible. Not merely duplicating the physical characteristics of the factory, but also duplicating the skills that the original employees had. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (factory; skills): copy = duplicate features = characteristics Explanation:the speaker explains more about the strict controls that should be imposed over the systems, in order to avoid problems. When copying from successful models, it is important to copy the features of the original factory very closely. Another solution is to copy/duplicate the skills of the employees in that original factory. So the answers are: factory/factories 40. Answer: skills Here’s what the speaker says: And this in turn means copying the original as closely as possible. Not merely duplicating the physical characteristics of the factory, but also duplicating the skills that the original employees had. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (factory; skills): copy = duplicate features = characteristics Explanation:the speaker explains more about the strict controls that should be imposed over the systems, in order to avoid problems. When copying from successful models, it is important to copy the features of the original factory very closely. Another solution is to copy/duplicate the skills of the employees in that original factory. So the answers are: skills",
      "excerpt_clean": "SECTION 1 1. Answer: central Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: What about the location? MAN: It’d be nice to be central . Explanation: When the man says that “It’d be nice…”, this means that he prefers a central location. The answer is central. 2. Answer: 600 Here’s what the speakers say: WOMAN: What’s your upper limit for the rent? MAN: We’d like [ ]",

Answer: plates 10. Answer: 60 SECTION 2 11. Answer: B. research and education. Here’s what the speaker says: Our remit is to give educational opportunities to the wider public as well as to offer research sites for a wide variety of agriculturists and other scientists. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): purpose = remit Explanation: According to the speaker, their “remit” (meaning “the task or area of activity officially assigned to an individual or organization”, which can be considered “purpose” in this circumstance) is to give “educational” and “research” opportunities. The answer must be B. 12. Answer: (the) Forest Here’s what the speaker says: – As you can see here on our giant wall plan, we are now situated in the Reception Block…here. As you walk out of the main door into the park there is a path you can follow. If you follow this route you will immediately come into the Rare Breeds Section, where we keep a wide variety of animals….Next to this…moving east…is the large Grazing Area for the rare breeds. Then further east…in the largest section of our Park is the Forest Area. Explanation:starting from the Reception Block, follow the instructions, passing the Rare Breeds Section and Grazing Area, then we reach the Forest Area. The answer is (the)Forest. 13. Answer: Fish Farm(s). Here’s what the speaker says: – South of the Grazing Area and in fact just next to the Reception Block is our Experimental Crops Area. In the middle of the Park…this circular area is our lake…These two small rectangular areas here…are the Fish Farms where we rear fish for sale. Explanation:the speaker mentions the Reception Block and the lake, and then refers to two small rectangles on the plan. These are the Fish Farms. The answer is Fish Farm(s). 14. Answer: Market Garden. Here’s what the speaker says: – To the east of those is the Marsh Area, which attracts a great many migrant birds. In the south-eastern corner, beyond the Marsh, is our Market Garden Area, growing vegetables and flowers. Explanation:the speaker finally refers to the Marsh and then to the south-eastern part of the plan, which is the Market Garden Area. The answer is Market Garden. 15. Answer: C. a short time every year Here’s what the speaker says: – All these areas can be visited by the general public for almost all the year . . . although please take note of the large signs at the entrance to each area which tell. . . which tell you when certain areas are being used for particular controlled experiments andare therefore temporarily out of bounds to the public. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): closed = out of bounds short time = temporarily Explanation: It is said that certain areas will be temporarily “out of bounds”, meaning “forbidden”, to the public when they are used for experimental activities, otherwisethey are open almost all the year. From this we know that the time when they are “closed” will only be temporary, or to say, “short”. The answer has to be C. 16. Answer: A. by tram, walking or bicycle Here’s what the speaker says: – Well you have a choice of means . . . all environmentally friendly. . . cars are banned in the park. We have bicycles which you can hire behind the Reception Block . . . here . . . the healthy ones of you can go on foot and finally there’s our electric tram, powered from solar cells. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): walking = go on foot Explanation: It is said that cars are banned in the park, so B is clearly wrong (do not mistake solar car with solar-powered tram which is mentioned in the recording). There is no mention made of any bus so C is incorrect. The speaker only names the following means to move around, including “bicycles”, “electric tram” and “going on foot” (thesame as “walking”). Hence A is the correct answer. 17. Answer: C. goats and hens. Here’s what the speaker says: – A good place to start on your tour is the Rare Breeds section. We keep goats, sheep and hens and other kinds of poultry. We are also thinking of bringing in cows and horses but we do not, as yet, have facilities for these bigger animals. Explanation: The speaker clearly states that they currently keep goats and hens in the Rare Breeds section, so the answer is C. However, stay alert when cows and horses are also mentioned, because the park is “thinking of bringing them in”, so that could be the future but not now. The answer is C. 18. Answer: B. to keep a variety of breeds Here’s what the speaker says: – These are very popular with the public but of course we mustn’t lose sight of the main purpose of having this section, not as such to preserve rare animals but to maintain the diversity of breeds to broaden the gene pool for agricultural development. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): save = preserve unusual = rare keep = maintain variety = diversity Explanation: The section is popular with the public, but it is not mentioned that it aims to educate the public, thus C is not given. Be careful with answer A because the speaker clearly says that it is not the section’s main purpose to “preserve rare animals” (the same as “save unusual animals”), but to “maintain the diversity of breeds” (the same as “keep a variety of breeds”). Therefore the answer must be B. 19. Answer: C. a demonstration of fishing Here’s what the speaker says: – May will be perhaps our most spectacular month with the arrival of the Canada geese and when our fruit trees will be in full blossom, but there are interesting events on all year round . . . for example John Havers, our expertfly fisherman, is currently giving displays on the lake. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): at the present time = currently demonstration = displays fishing = fisherman Explanation: The arrival of Canada geese, which can be considered “wild birds”, and the blossom of fruit trees will happen in May, meaning you CANNOT see these things at the present. On the other hand, a fisherman is “currently giving displays” which is the same as giving a “demonstration”, so it is clear that the answer is C. The answer is C. 20. Answer: A. animals. Here’s what the speaker says: … there is a wide selection of books on wildlife, some of them written by local authors, and the history of farming, including organic farming, something which the park will be diversifying into in the coming months. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): animals = wildlife Explanation: There are books on wildlife, which includes wild “animals”, so A is correct. Note that there are also books about the history of farming (NOTthe history of the park) and written by the locals, but we do not know for sure if the books are about local traditions, therefore B and C are not correct. The answer is A. SECTION 3 21. Answer: A. Queensland Here’s what the speaker says: GRANT: Anyway, my current research involves trying to find a particular type of bee, the Asian Honey Bee, and finding out whether there are any of them around in various states of Australia. We discovered a few of them in Queensland onceand eradicated them. Now, we’re pretty keen to make sure that there aren’t any more getting in, particularly to New South Wales and other states. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): found = discovered Explanation:In the past, Asian honey bees were discovered, or found, in Queensland, so A is the correct answer. The speaker says that they want to make sure “there aren’t any more getting in, particularly to New South Wales and other states”, so the bees haven’t been to New South Wales and other states yet, hence B and C are incorrect. The answer is A. 22. Answer: B. carry parasites. Here’s what the speaker says: – Well, in fact, they look almost the same, but they are infested with mites – microscopic creatures which live on them, and which can seriously damage our own home-grown bees, or could even wipe them out. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): parasites = creatures which live on them native = home grown Explanation: The Asian honey bees “are infested with mites”, meaning they carry mites in large numbers. So these mites can be considered “parasites” that live on another organism – Asian honey bees. There is no reference to the Asian bees attacking the native bees, so A is not correct. It is the mites which are the problem. Also, crops are not mentioned in the recording, thus C is not given. The correct answer is B. 23. Answer: C. They are sold to customers abroad. Here’s what the speaker says: – Well, the honey from Australian bees is of excellent quality, much better than the stuff the Asian bees produce. ln fact, Australia exports native Queenbees to a large number of countries because of this. When the European Honey Bee was first discovered out in the bush, we found they made really unpleasant honey and they were also too big to pollinate many of our native flowers here in Australia. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): sold abroad = export Explanation: Australian bees’ honey is of excellent quality, so A cannot be true. In addition, the bees that are too big to pollinate some flowers (meaning their size is the problem) are European honey bees, NOT Australian, so B is the wrong answer. The speaker says that Australian Queen bees are exported, indicating that they are sold abroad, hence C is the correct answer. 24. Answer: A. the country’s economy would be affected. Here’s what the speaker says: GRANT: No, we managed to get them under control before that happened but if Asian bees got in there could be other consequences. We could lose a lot of money because you might not be aware, but it’s estimated that native bees’ pollination of flower and vegetable crops is worth 1.2 billion dollars a year. So in a way they’re the farmers’ friend. Oh, and another thing is, if you’re stung by an Asian Honey Bee, it can produce an allergic reaction in some people; so they’re much more dangerous than native bees. Explanation: Although certain areas of agriculture (flower and vegetable crops) are mentioned, they will be harmed NOT benefited by the arrival of Asian bees. Thus, C is completely wrong. Also, we only know that Asian honey bees may cause allergies, but there is no reference to whether they will help the study of allergies or not, so B is incorrect as well. What we do know from the recording is that Asian bees can cause theloss of a lot of money, meaning the economy would be affected. So the correct answer is A. 25. Answer: insects Here’s what the speakers say: PROFESSOR: How will you know if Asian bees have entered Australia? GRANT: We’re looking at the diet of the bird called the Rainbow Bee Eater. The Bee Eater doesn’t care what it eats, as long as they’re insects. Explanation: these birds will eat any type of insect, but they will only eat insects = they will eat anything “as long as they’re insects”. The answer is insects. 26. Answer: feeding/eating. Here’s what the speakers say: GRANT: Because insects have their skeletons outside their bodies, so the Bee Eaters digest the meat from the inside. Then they bring up all the indigestible bits of skeleton and, of course, the wings in a pellet – a small ball of waste material which they cough up. PROFESSOR: That sounds a bit unpleasant. So, how do you go about it? GRANT: In the field we track down the Bee Eaters and find their favouritefeeding spots, you know, the places where the birds usually feed. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (feeding): locations = spots/places like to = favourite Explanation: Grant explains that researchers examine the pellets of the Bee Eaters, and first they must go to the places where they know the Bee Eaters feed. These are the feeding spots/locations of the birds. The answer is feeding/eating. 27. Answer: laboratory Here’s what the speaker says: GRANT: It’s here that we can find the pellets. We collect them up and take them back to the laboratory to examine the contents. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (laboratory): for analysis = to examine Explanation: at the feeding locations, the researchers collect the pellets and then they examine/analyse them at the laboratory. The answer is laboratory. 28. Answer: water Here’s what the speaker says: GRANT: The pellets are really hard, especially if they have been out in the sun for a few days so, first of all, we treat them by adding water to moisten them and make them softer. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (water): soften = make softer Explanation: at the laboratory, the researchers put the pellets in water = moisten them. This makes the pellets softer, and the researchers are then ready to start examining them. The answer is water. 29. Answer: wings Here’s what the speaker says: GRANT: Then we pull them apart under the microscope. Everything’s all scrunched up, but we’re looking for the wings so we just pull them all out and straighten them. Then we identify them to see if we can find any Asian bee wings. Explanation: the soft pellets are then examined, and any wings in the pellets are identified, removed and then researchers look to see if any of these wings are the wings of Asian bees. The answer is wings. 30. Answer: reliable Here’s what the speaker says: GRANT: So far our research shows that Asian bees have not entered Australia in any number – it’s a good result and much more reliable than trying to find live ones as evidence of introduced insects. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (reliable): searching for = trying to find Explanation: the speaker explains how this method is much more reliable/accurate than trying to find live Asian bees. The result is that not many Asian bees have yet been introduced. The answer is reliable/accurate. SECTION 4 31. Answer: B. help from students in other countries. Here’s what the speaker says: … Now I had to set up my programme of research in three different countries, so I approached postgraduates in my field in overseas departments, contacting them by email, to organise things for me at their end. I thought I would have trouble recruiting help but in fact everyone was very willing and sometimes their tutors got involved too. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): students = postgraduates other countries = overseas Explanation: Shona got postgraduates in her field in overseas departments to organize things for her, so we can understand that she got help, NOT advice from these people. Additionally, these students are not her personal friends, they just studied in the same field, so A is wrong. And she did not have their contacts through her tutor (do not get misled by the word “tutor” in the recording, this refers to the tutors of the overseas students), so C is also wrong. The correct answer is B. 32. Answer: B. men who were working Here’s what the speaker says: – I decided that people under 18 should be excluded because most of them are students or looking for their first job, and also I decided at this stage just to focus on men who were in employment, and set up something for people who didn’t have jobs and for employed women later on as a separate investigation. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): working = in employment Explanation: Shona says that people under 18, or young people, were excluded so A is wrong. She didn’t include those who didn’t have jobs or employed women either (they will be investigated separately later on), so C is incorrect. Shona wanted to focus on “men who were in employment”. The phrase “in employment” means that the person is currently working. The correct answer must be B. 33. Answer: A. to get a wide range of data. Here’s what the speaker says: – With the questionnaire, rather than limiting it to one specific point, I wanted to include as much variety as possible. I know questionnaires are a very controlled way to do things but I thought I could do taped interviews later on to counteract the effects of this. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): wide range = variety guide = controlled Explanation: Shona specifically states that she didn’t want to limit the questionnaire to one point, so we can see that B is wrong. Also, she wanted to counteract the effects of questionnaires being too controlled, thus it can be inferred that she didn’t want this to happen, so she didn’t want to control or guide people through her questionnaires or interviews. Thus, C is wrong too. Meanwhile, Shona wanted to include variety (the same as “wide range”). So A is the correct answer. 34. Answer: A. Current concerns are misrepresented by the press. Here’s what the speaker says: – At the moment it looks as if, in the UK, despite the fact that newspapers continually report that people are unhappy with medical care, in fact it is mainly the third level of care, which takes place in hospitals, that they are worried about. Government reforms have been proposed at all levels and although their success is not guaranteed, long-term hospital care is in fact probably less of an issue than the media would have us believe. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): press = newspapers = the media concern = issue medical = hospital Explanation: According to Shona, the newspapers may exaggerate the level of concern that British people have about medical or hospital care (“less of an issue than the media would have us believe”). Also, people are mainly worried about the third level of care, UNLIKE the exaggerated reports of the press. Therefore, it can be understood that the press has “misrepresented” (meaning “have given a false or misleading presentation of”) the British people’s concerns or worries. So the correct answer is A. The recording does not mention anything related to “financial issues” so B is irrelevant, and although the success of hospital reforms “is not guaranteed”, it does not mean they have been unsuccessful, hence C is incorrect. The answer is A. 35. Answer: C. identify the preferences of the public. Here’s what the speaker says: – Certainly I will need to do more far-reaching research than I had anticipated in order to establish if people want extra medical staff invested in the community, or if they want care to revert to fewer, but larger, key medical units. The solution may well be something that can be easily implemented by those responsible in local government, with central government support of course. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): identify = establish the public = people Explanation: Shona wants to establish, or to know and identify, what people want to improve in medical care (“if people want extra medical staff invested in the community, or if they want care to revert to fewer, but larger, key medical units”). She wants to identify which of these people prefer. This means that she wants to “identify the preferences of the public” so C is correct. She also says something about the government and the solution, but it is not mentioned that she will present her work to the government, so A is not the answer. Neither is B, since securingextra funding is not her purpose for further research. The answer is C. 36. Answer: C. colleagues do not always agree. Here’s what the speaker says: – I was surprised by how willing most of the subjects were to get involved in the project – I had expected some unwillingness to answer questions honestly. But I was taken aback and rather concerned that something I thought I’d set up very well didn’t necessarily seem that way to everyone in my own department. Explanation: Shona realized that most subjects were willing to answer her questions, which is the opposite of B, so that’s incorrect. However, those in her own department (who can be called “colleagues”) did not see her work the way she did. This means that meanwhile Shona thought she had done well with the set up and planning, her colleagues did not agree. Hence, the correct answer is C. 37. Answer: B Here’s what the speaker says: – There were odd cases that threw me – one of the subjects who I had approached while he was out shopping in town, decided to pull out when it came to the second round. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): street = town stop participating = pull out Explanation: The person whom Shona interviewed on the street decided to “pull out”, which has the same meaning as “stop participating” when she was moving to the second part, in which the person is interviewed on tape (recorded) in more detail. So the answer must be B. 38. Answer: F Here’s what the speaker says: – And one of the first-year students I interviewed wanted reassurance that no names would be traceable from the answers. I was so surprised, because they think nothing of telling you about themselves and their opinions in seminar groups! Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (F): undergraduate = first-year student Explanation: A first-year student is also called an undergraduate, and the one Shona interviewed wanted to make sure that his/her name could not be traceable, meaning that he/she wanted his/her name to be “confidential” (means “kept secret or private”). Therefore, F is the correct answer. 39. Answer: D Here’s what the speaker says: – Then, one of the people that I work with got a bit funny. The questions were quite personal and one minute he said he’d do it, then the next day he wouldn’t, and in the end he did do it. It’s hard not to get angry in that situation but I tried to keep focused on the overall picture in order to stay calm. Explanation: One of the people whom Shona worked with, referring to a colleague, “kept changing his mind” about whether he would participate in the interview or not. So the answer is D. Be careful when you hear the word “angry” though, because in fact he didn’t get mad at Shona. In fact, it was Shona who almost got angry – although in the end she stayed calm. 40. Answer: C Here’s what the speaker says: – The most bizarre case was a telephone interview I did with a teacher at a university in France. He answered all my questions in great detail – but then when I asked how much access he had to dangerous substances he wouldn’ttell me exactly what his work involved. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): tutor = teacher job = work Explanation: The teacherat a French university, who can also be referred to as “a tutor in a foreign university”, wouldn’t tell Shona what his work involved, indicating he refused to say something about his job/work. Hence, C is correct.",

      "content_clean": "SECTION 1 1. Answer: C. a video about the festival. Here’s what the speaker says: GEORGE: They had a video with all the highlights of the festival at a stand in the lobby to the library, so I heard them. They play fantastic instruments – drums and flutes and old kinds of guitars. I’ve never heard anything like it before. Explanation: George saw a video, in which there was a group playing music with different instruments, but he did NOT directly see the group or the instruments on site. Thus, A and B are wrong. The video that he saw at the lobby was about all the highlights of the festival. The answer is C. 2. Answer: B. hear clearly. Here’s what the speakers say: GEORGE: The only problem is there aren’t any cheap seats . . . it’s all one price. NINA: Well, in that case we could sit right at the front – we’d have a really good view. GEORGE: Yeah, though I think that if you sit at the back you can actually hear the whole thing better. Explanation: C is wrong because all the seats are one price. A is also wrong because they can only get a good view (or see well) if they “sit right at the front” which is not the question. George says that sitting at the back allows them to “hear the whole thing better”. The correct answer is B. 3. Answer: 48 North Avenue. Here’s what the speaker says: GEORGE: Name: George O’Neill. Address: 48 North Avenue, Westsea. So, the answer is 48 North Avenue. 4. Answer: WS6 2YH Here’s what the speakers say: GEORGE: Do you remember our new postcode? Still can’t remember it. NINA: Just a minute – I’ve got it written down here. WS6 2YH . The answer is WS6 2YH. 5. Answer: 01674 553242. Here’s what the speakers say: NINA: Do you need the phone too? GEORGE: Please. I’m really bad at numbers. NINA: 01674 553242 . The answer is 01674 553242. 6. Answer: (free)drinks Here’s what the speaker says: NINA: Sunday 17th of June. Singer, £6.00 includes drinks in the garden. So, we know that the price of £6 includes drinks in the garden. The answer is (free)drinks. 7. Answer: (the)pianist/ piano player. Here’s what the speakers say: NINA: How about the pianist on the 22nd of June? GEORGE: Anna Ventura? So, the event is the performance by the pianist, Anna Ventura. The answer is (the)pianist/ piano player. 8. Answer: £10.50 Here’s what the speakers say: NINA: …but we can go to the Spanish dance and guitar concert together, can’t we? GEORGE: Yes – I’m sure Tom and Kieran would enjoy that too. Good heavens – £10.50 a ticket! The price for a ticket is, therefore, £10.50. 9. Answer: four/4. Here’s what the speaker says: GEORGE: I can see we’re going to have to go without food for the rest of the week – we’ll need to book four. So, the answer is four/4. 10. Answer: 50% Here’s what the speaker says: NINA: Wish we were students – look! Children, Students and Senior Citizens get a 50% discount on everything. The answer is 50%, which is the discount on all tickets. SECTION 2 11. Answer: 1.30 Here’s what the speaker says: – we’re open every day of the week from 9.00 a.m to 8.00 p.m. except onMondays when we close at 1.30 p.m. So, although the Museum closes at 8.00 p.m. on six days of the week, on Mondays it closes at 1.30 p.m. The answer is 1.30 12. Answer: 25th December/25 December/Christmas Day Here’s what the speaker says: – And, in fact the only day of the year when we’re closed is on the 25th of December. So, the answer is 25th December/25 December/Christmas Day. 13. Answer: car park/parking lot Here’s what the speaker says: – If you bring a school group to the museum, when you arrive we ask you to remain with your group in the car park. One or more of the tour guides will welcome you there… meet = welcome Therefore, the answer is car park/parking lot. 14. Answer: 45 Here’s what the speaker says: – if you bring a school group, you should plan on allowing a minimum of 90 minutes for the visit. This allows 15 minutes to get on and off the coach, 45minutes for the guided tour and 30 minutes for after-tour activities. So, out of the minimum recommended visit to the Museum, the guided tour takes 45 minutes. The answer is 45. 15. Answer: (some) tables. Here’s what the speaker says: – There are two cafes in the museum, with seating for 80 people. If you want to eat there, you’ll need to reserve some seating, as they can get quite crowded at lunch time. Then outside the museum at the back there are tables, and students can bring their own lunch and eat it there in the open air. behind = at the back of Therefore, if students bring their own lunch, there are tables in the open air behind the museum where they can eat. The answer is (some) tables. 16-18: Answer: C. cameras, F. pens, G. worksheets Here’s what the speaker says: When the students come into the museum foyer we ask them to check in their backpacks with their books, lunch boxes, etc, at the cloakroom before they enter the museum proper. I’m afraid in the past we have had a few things gone missing after school visits so this is a strict rule. Also, some of the exhibits are fragile and we don’t want them to be accidentally knocked. But we do provide school students with handouts with questions and quizzes on them. There’s so much that students can learn in the museum and it’s fun for them to have something to do. Of course they’ll need to bring something to writewith forthese. We do allow students to take photographs. For students who are doing projects it’s useful to make some kind of visual record of what they see that they can add to their reports. And finally, they should not bring anything to eat into the museum, or drinks of any kind. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (C, F, G): bags = backpacks worksheets = handouts Explanation: The students are not allowed to come in the museum with backpacks (or bags) and books which will be checked in when they enter. So D and E are wrong answers. In addition, it is said that “they should not bring anything to eat into the museum, or drinks of any kind” so food and water is out of the question too, hence A and B are wrong. The speaker says that the students will be provided handouts with questions and quizzes on them, which can be considered “worksheets” and of course can be carried into the museum. Thus, Gis correct. And the students need to bring something to write with, which are obviously “pens” so F is correct too. Finally, taking photographs is allowed in the museum and it can only be done by bringing a camera. C is also correct. So, the correct answers are C, F, G. 19-20: Answer: B. watch films, E. play computer games Here’s what the speaker says: There are also a few things the students can do after the tour. In the theatrette on the ground floor there are continuous screenings of short documentaries about dinosaurs which they can see at any time. We used to have an activity room with more interactive things like making models of dinosaurs and drawing and painting pictures, even hunting for dinosaur eggs, but unfortunately the room was damaged in a bad storm recently when water came in the roof, so that’s closed at the moment. But we do have an IT centrewhere students have access to CD ROMs with a range of dinosaur games. These games are a lot of fun, but they also teach the students about the lives of dinosaurs, how they found food, protected their habitat, survived threats, that kind of thing. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (B E): films = documentaries find = hunt Explanation: Students can watch documentaries, which are a type of film, so B is correct. It is said that the activity room where the students can make dinosaur models, draw pictures and hunt for eggs is currently closed, meaning that they CANNOT do these activities now. Hence, A, C and D are incorrect. Lastly, students have access to “CD ROMs with a range of dinosaur games” which means they can play games on computers, hence E is correct. The answers are B, E. SECTION 3 21. Answer: A. should be re-ordered in some parts. Here’s what the speaker says: TUTOR: And I’ve made a few notes on the proposal about things whichcould have been better sequenced. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): order = sequence Explanation: “sequence” means “arrange in a particular order”, so the proposal is not well-ordered in some parts and needs re-ordering. The correct answer is A. 22. Answer: C. shortened her sentences. Here’s what the speaker says: TUTOR: Generally speaking, I feel you’ve often used complex structures and long sentences for the sake of it and as a consequence . . . although your paragraphing and inclusion of sub-headings help . . . it’s quite hard to follow your train of thought at times. So cut them down a bit, can you? Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (C): insert = inclusion shorten = cut down Explanation: The question asks what Sandra could do to improve her proposal, something she hasn’t done yet. According to the recording, we know that Sandra’s paragraphing and subheadings help, meaning that she has already done those two things, so A and B are not correct. Instead, the speaker suggests Sandra “cut down” her long sentences, which means that they need to be “shortened”. The answer is C. 23. Answer: A. Separate points were not clearly identified. Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: And don’t forget simple formatting like numbering. SANDRA: Didn’t I use page numbers? TUTOR: I didn’t mean that. Look, you’ve remembered to include headers and footers, which is good, but listing ideas clearly is important. Number them oruse bullet points, which is even clearer. Then you’ll focus the reader on your main points. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (A): points = ideas Explanation: The tutor says he didn’t mean “that” which refers to Sandra’s page numbering, so we understand that page numbering is not the problem thus C is incorrect. There is no mention of the headings (only a reference to ‘headers and footers’), so B is irrelevant. However, the tutor recommends “listing ideas clearly” (by numbering or using bullet points), indicating that Sandra didn’t make her points clear and separate from one another. Thus, the correct answer is A. 24. Answer: B. movies she saw as a child. Here’s what the speaker says: SANDRA: I’ve always wanted to go there. My father was a great fan of cowboy films and the Wild West so I was subjected to seeing all the epics, many of which were shot there. As a consequence, it feels very familiar to me and it’s awesome both geographically and visually, so it’s somewhere I’vealways wanted to visit. The subsequent research I did and the online photographs made me even keener. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (B): movies = epics the internet = online Explanation: Sandra says that she has always wanted to visit the park “as a consequence” of the epic movies she watched. Subsequently, she did research (which can be considered similar to “reading articles”) and looked at online photos, which made her “even keener”, meaning she was keen before, so these two factors came after the cowboy movies. It was the movies that made her interested in the first place. The correct answer is B. 25-27: B. field trip activities, C. geographical features, F. plant and animal life Here’s what the speakers say: SANDRA: Well, I thought that from the perspective of a field trip, one thing I needed to focus on was the sandstone plateaux and cliffs themselves (…) TUTOR: Well, yes, I’d agree with including those points . . . SANDRA: And then the fact that it’s been home to native American Navajos and all the social history that goes with that. (…) TUTOR: Well, I agree it’s interesting, but it’s not immediately relevant to your proposal, Sandra, so at this stage, I suggest you focus on other considerations. I think an indication of what the students on the trip could actually do when they get there should be far more central, so that certainly needs to be included and to be expanded upon. And I’d like to see somethingabout the local wildlife, and vegetation too, not that I imagine there’s much to see. Presumably the tourist invasion hasn’t helped. SANDRA: Okay, I’ll do some work on those two areas as well. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answers (B, C, F): plant = vegetation animal life = wildlife Explanation: The tutor agrees with Sandra’s idea about focusing on “sandstone plateaux and cliffs”, which are “geographical features”, so C is correct. The tutor also suggests mentioning what students could do on the trip (= activities) and something about local wildlife and vegetation (similar to “plant and animal life”), hence B and F are correct as well. The recording does not include information about “climate change” or “myths and legends” so A and E are irrelevant. Finally, the tutor opposes Sandra’s initial intention of includingthe “social history” of the natives in her proposal, therefore G is clearly wrong. The correct answers are B, C and F. 28. Answer: 12,000. Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: …but what area does the tribal park cover? Do you know? SANDRA: 12,000 hectares….. The answer is clearly 12,000. 29. Answer: horses Here’s what the speaker says: SANDRA: I think the best way to appreciate the area would be to hire horses instead and trek around on those. Biking is not allowed and it’s impossible to drive around the area in vehicles. Her suggestion is that they use horses to travel around in the Park. The answer is horses. 30. Answer: caves Here’s what the speakers say: TUTOR: Okay, lastly, what else is worth visiting there? SANDRA: There are several caves, but I haven’t looked into any details. I’ll find out about them. Explanation: the tutor asks about other places worth visiting in the park. Sandra mentions only the caves, so this must be the correct answer. The answer is caves. SECTION 4 31. Answer: surface Here’s what the speaker says: – Well, we learn a great deal about all the processes that have affected and that continue to affect the Earth’s surface. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (surface): effects (noun) = affect (verb) Explanation: the speaker talks about the processes that have an effect on the surface of the Earth, so the answer is surface. 32. Answer: environment Here’s what the speaker says: – But we learn far more than that, because studying geography also informs us about the different kinds of relationships that develop between a particularenvironment and the people that live there. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (environment): population = people that live there Explanation: when relationships develop between 2 things, this is called a ‘dynamic’ relationship. In this case, the developing relationship is between a specific environment and the population in that environment. The answer is environment. 33. Answer: impact Here’s what the speaker says: – We like to think of geography as having two main branches. There’s the study of the nature of our planet – its physical features, what it actually looks like – and then there’s the study of the ways in which we choose to live and of the impact of those on the planet. Our current use of carbon fuels is a good example of that. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (impact): human lifestyles = the way we choose to live Explanation: the speaker now talks about the 2 branches of geography. Firstly, there is the study of physical features and, secondly, there is the study of our way of life/lifestyles and how these affect (= impact on) the planet. The answer is impact(s)/effect(s). 34. Answer: urban Here’s what the speaker says: – But there are more specific study areas to consider too, and we’ll be looking at each of these in turn throughout this semester………Next comes historical geography – the understanding of how people and their environments and the ways they interact have changed over a period of time – and urban geography, an aspect I’m particularly interested in, which takes as its focus the location of cities, the services that those cities provide, and migration of people to and from such cities. And lastly, we have cartography. Explanation: the speaker describes each of the specific study areas. This description follows the order of the different types of geography given in the question. Thus, after historical geography, the speaker then refers to the missing study area – urban geography. After describing this, the speaker then mentions the final study area – cartography. Therefore, the answer is urban. 35. Answer: problems Here’s what the speaker says: – So, to summarise before we continue, we now have our key answer…. studying this subject is important because without geographical knowledge, we would know very little about our surroundings and we wouldn’t be able to identify all the problems that relate to them. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (problems): associate= relate to Explanation: the speaker refers to the ‘key answer’ to explain why geography is useful and necessary to study. If we do not understand our surroundings, then we cannot solve the problems that face us. The answer is problems. 36. Answer: images Here’s what the speaker says: – What do geographers actually do? Well, we collect data to begin with ! ….We might, for example, conduct a census – count a population in a given area perhaps. We also need images of the earth’s surface which we can produce by means of computer-generation technology or with the help of satellite relays. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (images): information = data Explanation: referring to what geographers do, the speaker gives examples of the kind of data that they collect. The first example is conducting a census, and then – using computers and satellites – images of the earth’s surface can be obtained. The answer is images. 37. Answer: patterns Here’s what the speaker says: – After we’ve gathered our information, we must analyse it ! We need to look for patterns, most commonly those of causes and consequences. Here are some key words that help you to get the correct answer (patterns): effects = consequences Explanation: the speaker says that geographers then analyse the information, in particular looking for patterns, especially causes and effects/ consequences. The answer is patterns. 38. Answer: distortion Here’s what the speaker says: – Maps can be folded and put in a pocket and can provide a great store of reference when they’re collected into an atlas….. But there is a drawback. You can’t exactly replicate something that is three-dimensional, like our planet, on a flat piece of paper, because paper has only two dimensions, and that means there’ll always be a certain degree of distortion on a map. Explanation: the speaker talks about the advantages of maps, but also mentions one drawback. The problem is that maps are printed on paper. Paper has two dimensions, but the planet has three dimensions, so there will always be some distortion on a map – it won’t be an exact representation. The answer is distortion. 39. Answer: traffic Here’s what the speaker says: – We can also use aerial photographs…. pictures taken by cameras at high altitude above the earth. They are great for showing all kinds of geographical features that are not easy to see from the ground. You can easily illustrate areas of diseased trees or how much traffic is on the roads at a given time or information about deep sea beds, for example. Explanation: the speaker refers to aerial photographs. There are examples of some of the uses of these photos to show physical features: vegetation problems = areas of diseased trees; traffic density = how much traffic is on the roads; and ocean floor = deep sea beds. So, the answer is traffic. 40. Answer: weather Here’s what the speaker says: – Then there are Landsats. These are satellites that circle the earth and transmit visual information to computers at receiving stations. They circle the earth several times a day and can provide a mass of information – you’ll all be familiar with the information they give us about the weather, for example. Explanation: finally, the speaker talks about Landsats and what they do. They have many uses, including monitoring (= giving information about) the weather conditions. The answer is weather.",

      "content_clean": "Reading Passage 1 Questions 1–13 1 The correct answer is ‘posts’: In the first paragraph, the text describes the ‘qanat method’ of construction, ‘which consisted of placing posts over a hill in a straight line, to ensure that the tunnel kept to its route’. This means that the posts were placed to direct the tunnelling. ‘Shafts’ is incorrect: The text says that the shafts were dug down into the ground after the posts were put in position. 2 The correct answer is ‘canal’: In the first paragraph, the text says, ‘Once the tunnel was completed, it allowed water to flow from the top of a hillside down towards a canal, which supplied water for human use.’ The words ‘flow’ and run have the same meaning in this context, and the phrase ‘for human use’ means that the canal supplied water for local people. 3 The correct answer is ‘ventilation’: In the first paragraph, the text says, ‘The excavated soil was taken up to the surface using the shafts, which also provided ventilation during the work.’ This sentence explains two uses of the shafts: for removing earth and also for ventilation. This means that workers underground had access to fresh air through the shafts. 4 The correct answer is ‘lid’: In the second paragraph, the text describes Roman qanat tunnels, saying, ‘The shafts were equipped with handholds and footholds to help those climbing in and out of them and were covered with a wooden or stone lid.’ 5 The correct answer is ‘weight’: In the second paragraph, the text says, ‘Romans hung a plumb line from a rod placed across the top of each shaft and made sure that the weight at the end of it hung in the center of the shaft.’ The diagram shows a weight hanging in the centre of the shaft at the end of the plumb line. ‘Rod’ is incorrect: The text says that the rod was at the top of the shaft, and the diagram shows this. 6 The correct answer is ‘climbing’: In the second paragraph, the text describes Roman qanat tunnels, saying, ‘The shafts were equipped with handholds and footholds to help those climbing in and out of them’. This explains the purpose of the handholds and footholds: it tells us what they were used for. 7 The correct answer is FALSE: In the third paragraph, the text describes the ‘counterexcavation method’ and then says, ‘It was used to cut through high mountains when the qanat method was not a practical alternative.’ This means that the counter-excavation method did not completely replace the qanat method; it was used as an alternative in situations where it would have been too difficult to use the qanat method. 8 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN: Although the text does describe the tasks of the builders, it does not describe their levels of experience, nor does the text mention that only builders with experience were employed. 9 The correct answer is FALSE : In the third paragraph, the text says, ‘An inscription written on the side of a 428-meter tunnel, built by the Romans as part of the Saldae aqueduct system in modern-day Algeria, describes how the two teams of builders missed each other in the mountain and how the later construction of a lateral link between both corridors corrected the initial error.’ This means that the information about the problem was recorded on an inscription in the tunnel, not in a book. 10 The correct answer is TRUE : In the third paragraph, the text explains how a ‘tunnel was constructed from both ends’ and how it ‘had to meet correctly at the center of the mountain’. It then refers to the inscription in the Saldae aqueduct system tunnel which ‘describes how the two teams of builders missed each other in the mountain and how the later construction of a lateral link between both corridors corrected the initial error’. In other words, the two parts of the tunnel failed to meet. 11 The correct answer is ‘gold’: In the fourth paragraph, the text refers to Roman tunnels ‘built for mineral extraction’ and then says, ‘Traces of such tunnels used to mine gold can still be found at the Dolaucothi mines in Wales.’ 12 The correct answer is ‘(the) architect(’s) (name)’: Towards the end of the fifth paragraph, the text says, ‘Most tunnels had inscriptions showing the names of patrons who ordered construction and sometimes the name of the architect.’ If a name is on an inscription in a tunnel, this means that this person’s name is carved on the tunnel. 13 The correct answer is ‘(the) harbour’ or ‘(the) harbor’: At the end of the fifth paragraph, the text says that the Çevlik tunnel was ‘built to divert the floodwater threatening the harbor of the ancient city of Seleuceia Pieria’. The fact that the harbour was threatened by floodwater means that the tunnel which diverted this water was built to protect it. Reading Passage 2 Questions 14–26 14 The correct answer is A : The writer describes a scene in which people of all ages are using digital devices and then makes the comment, ‘Unbeknown to most of us, an invisible, gamechanging transformation links everyone in this picture’. The writer is making the point that this use of technology is causing ‘an invisible … transformation’, in other words, a hidden effect. The phrase ‘Unbeknown to most of us’ means that most people are unaware of the transformation: this reinforces the idea that the effect is hidden. B is incorrect: The writer does not say anything about helping young people to read. C is incorrect: The writer does not give an opinion about whether using technology on planes should be encouraged. D is incorrect: The writer mentions different uses of technology but does not compare them. 15 The correct answer is B: The text refers to Sherry Turkle’s view that ‘we do not err as a society when we innovate but when we ignore what we disrupt or diminish while innovating’. This tells us that Turkle believes it is a serious mistake not to consider the negative effects of innovation, including ‘what we … diminish’: in other words, what is lost. A is incorrect: The text does not say anything about a reduction in print reading. C is incorrect: The text does not refer to young people becoming involved in innovation. D is incorrect: The text does not mention any comparison between developing products and developing ideas. 16 The correct answer is D: The writer refers to the fact that the brain’s reading circuit ‘needs an environment to develop’ and says that ‘it will adapt to that environment’s requirements – from different writing systems to the characteristics of whatever medium is used’. This means that the circuit will adjust in any way that it is required. A is incorrect: The writer points out that, unlike vision and language, reading is not an inborn human ability. B is incorrect: The fact that there are different reading mediums is mentioned, but this is not the point which the writer is making in the paragraph. C is incorrect: The writer says that the brain is required to adapt to different writing systems but does not say that these demands are unexpected. 17 The correct answer is B: The text says that Mark Edmundson ‘describes how many college students actively avoid the classic literature of the 19th and 20th centuries in favour of something simpler as they no longer have the patience to read longer, denser, more difficult texts’. He is saying that students’ impatience with more difficult texts (their attitude) means that they choose to read simple reading matter rather than classic 19th- and 20th-century literature. A is incorrect: Edmundson does not mention having changed the way he teaches. C is incorrect: Edmundson does not make a comparison between his own level of concern and that of other people. D is incorrect: Edmundson makes no reference to the views of the general public. 18 The correct answer is D : The writer says, ‘Multiple studies show that digital screen use may be causing a variety of troubling downstream effects’. The word worrying has a similar meaning to ‘troubling’. 19 The correct answer is H: The writer refers to Anne Mangen’s study and says, ‘Results indicated that students who read on print were superior in their comprehension to screenreading peers, particularly in their ability to sequence detail’. Having ‘superior … comprehension’ of the details of the plot has a similar meaning to having a more thorough understanding of it. 20 The correct answer is F: The writer refers to Anne Mangen’s study and says, ‘Results indicated that students who read on print were superior in their comprehension to screenreading peers, particularly in their ability to … reconstruct the plot in chronological order.’ If the students who read on print were more able to reconstruct the plot in chronological order, this means that those who read screens found it hard (were less able) to recall the order of information in the story. 21 The correct answer is B : The writer refers to Ziming Liu’s finding ‘that the “new norm” in reading is skimming, involving word-spotting and browsing through the text’. The phrase ‘the new norm’ describes a current tendency. The term ‘word-spotting’ describes the strategy of picking out single or isolated words and phrases located throughout the text. 22 The correct answer is C: The writer says, ‘When the reading brain skims like this, it reduces time allocated to deep reading processes. In other words, we don’t have time to grasp complexity, to understand another’s feelings, to perceive beauty, and to create thoughts of the reader’s own.’ Not having time to ‘grasp complexity’ and ‘understand another’s feelings’ has a similar meaning to only gaining a superficial understanding of a text’s emotional content. 23 The correct answer is YES: In the penultimate paragraph (the paragraph before the final one), the writer refers to ‘how we all have begun to read on various mediums and how that changes not only what we read, but also the purposes for which we read’. In this sentence, the word ‘that’ refers back to the fact that we have all begun to read on various mediums. The writer is suggesting that we choose reading content according to the particular medium that we are using. 24 The correct answer is NO: In the penultimate paragraph, the writer refers to the loss of complex reading skills and says, ‘Nor is it only about the young. The subtle atrophy of critical analysis and empathy affects us all equally.’ 25 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN: In the penultimate paragraph, the writer says that our loss of complex reading skills is ‘leaving us susceptible to false information’ but does not say whether false information has become more widespread today. 26 The correct answer is YES: In the final paragraph, the writer says, ‘We possess both the science and the technology to identify and redress the changes in how we read before they become entrenched.’ When referring to problems, the word ‘redress’ means to rectify, correct or put right. ‘Before they become entrenched’ means before they become firmly established, meaning that we still have the chance or opportunity to rectify these problems. Reading Passage 3 Questions 27–40 27 The correct answer is iii: The text gives examples of AI predictions and says, ‘AI is almost always better at forecasting than we are’. 28 The correct answer is vi: The text says that ‘if Watson generated a recommendation that contradicted the experts’ opinion, doctors would typically conclude that Watson wasn’t competent’. The writer also uses the phrase ‘even more suspicion and disbelief’ to refer to doctors’ reactions and says that many doctors chose to ‘ignore the seemingly outlandish AI recommendations and stick to their own expertise’. The word ‘suspicion’ and the fact that doctors chose to rely on their own expertise rather than AI recommendations indicate distrust. The phrases ‘even more suspicion’ and ‘many doctors’ indicate that this distrust was widespread. 29 The correct answer is ii: The text gives three reasons why we have more faith in human judgement than in AI: our lack of familiarity with AI, our lack of understanding of how AI works and our perception that AI often goes wrong. First, it explains that ‘Trust in other people is often based on our understanding of how others think and having experience of their reliability. This helps create a psychological feeling of safety’, and then contrasts this with our relative lack of familiarity with AI: ‘AI, on the other hand, is still fairly new and unfamiliar to most people’. Next, it says that ‘AI’s decision-making process is usually too difficult’ to understand and explains that ‘interacting with something we don’t understand can cause anxiety and give us a sense that we’re losing control’. Finally, the text mentions the fact that ‘Embarrassing AI failures receive a disproportionate amount of media attention, emphasising the message that we cannot rely on technology.’ 30 The correct answer is i: The text refers to an experiment focusing on positive and negative views of AI which found that ‘simply watching a cinematic vision of our technological future polarised the participants’ attitudes’. If something ‘polarises attitudes’, this means that it divides them into two opposing groups. The text then goes on to emphasise this increasing divergence of attitudes, saying, ‘Optimists became more extreme in their enthusiasm for AI and sceptics became even more guarded.’ 31 The correct answer is vii: The text refers to ways of improving trust in AI and then it says ‘Another solution may be to reveal more about the algorithms which AI uses and the purposes they serve. Several high-profile social media companies and online marketplaces already release transparency reports about government requests and surveillance disclosures.’ The words ‘reveal’, ‘transparency reports’ and ‘disclosures’ are all connected with the idea of openness. The text then says, ‘A similar practice for AI could help people have a better understanding of the way algorithmic decisions are made.’ In this sentence, the writer is suggesting that this kind of openness should be encouraged. 32 The correct answer is v: The text refers to some research and says, ‘one study showed that when people were allowed the freedom to slightly modify an algorithm, they felt more satisfied with its decisions, more likely to believe it was superior and more likely to use it in the future’. Allowing people to ‘slightly modify an algorithm’ is an example of involving users in AI processes, and the three positive results of this are examples of advantages. The text then says that ‘if people are given a degree of responsibility for how [AI systems] are implemented, they will be more willing to accept AI into their lives’. This is a further example of involving users in AI processes and a further advantage which results from the involvement. 33 The correct answer is C: The text gives examples of what AI can do and then highlights the existence of a problem, saying, ‘Yet for all these technological advances, we still seem to deeply lack confidence in AI predictions.’ A is incorrect: The writer expresses concern about our lack of confidence in AI but does not provide any solutions in this section. B is incorrect: The writer gives an opinion but does not justify it. D is incorrect: The writer describes a phenomenon but does not explain reasons for it. 34 The correct answer is B: The text says, ‘AI’s decision-making process is usually too difficult for most people to comprehend. And interacting with something we don’t understand can cause anxiety and give us a sense that we’re losing control.’ ‘Anxiety’ and ‘a sense of losing control’ are examples of feeling at a disadvantage. A is incorrect: The text mentions AI’s decisionmaking processes but does not say anything about AI replacing humans in decision-making jobs. C is incorrect: The text does not say anything about people wanting to wait for the technology to be tested. D is incorrect: The text does not say anything about AI seeming more challenging than it really is. 35 The correct answer is A: The text says, ‘Embarrassing AI failures receive a disproportionate amount of media attention, emphasising the message that we cannot rely on technology.’ If media gives people ‘the message that we cannot rely on technology’, it causes them to be mistrustful of it. B is incorrect: The text says that AI failures receive a disproportionate amount of media attention compared with AI successes; it does not say that the media devotes an excessive amount of attention to AI in general. C is incorrect: The text says that the amount of attention the media gives to AI failures is disproportionate; it does not say that media reports involving AI are inaccurate. D is incorrect: The text refers to AI failures but does not mention any causes of these failures. 36 The correct answer is NO: In Section D, the writer refers to an experiment involving subjective depictions of AI in sci-fi films where ‘Optimists became more extreme in their enthusiasm for AI and sceptics became even more guarded.’ In other words, positive attitudes became even more positive and negative attitudes became even more negative. This indicates that the writer believes these depictions strengthen people’s existing opinions about automation: they do not make people change their opinions. 37 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN: In Section D, the writer mentions the increasing representation of AI in the media but does not say whether media portrayals are likely to become more positive. 38 The correct answer is YES: In Section D, the writer says that ‘refusing to accept the advantages offered by AI could place a large group of people at a serious disadvantage’. This means that it may have a negative effect on their lives. 39 The correct answer is NO: In Section E, the writer says, ‘Simply having previous experience with AI can significantly improve people’s opinions about the technology, as was found in the study mentioned above. Evidence also suggests the more you use other technologies such as the internet, the more you trust them.’ This indicates that the writer believes familiarity with AI can have a large impact on people’s attitudes to technology. 40 The correct answer is YES: In Section F, the writer says that ‘one study showed that when people were allowed the freedom to slightly modify an algorithm, they felt more satisfied with its decisions, more likely to believe it was superior and more likely to use it in the future’. This list of positive results corresponds to the idea of consumer approval. The writer therefore believes that AI applications which users are able to modify are more likely to gain consumer approval.",

      "content_clean": "Reading Passage 1 Questions 1–13 1 The correct answer is FALSE : The text says, ‘The Romans were not traditionally sailors but mostly land-based people, who learned to build ships from the people that they conquered, namely the Greeks and the Egyptians.’ In other words, the Romans picked up their shipbuilding skills from the Greeks and the Egyptians: they did not pass these skills on to these people. 2 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN : The text mentions the change to the ‘mortise and tenon’ method of fixing planks but does not say whether skilled craftsmen were needed for this. 3 The correct answer is FALSE : The text says, ‘Mediterranean shipbuilders shifted to another shipbuilding method, still in use today, which consisted of building the frame first and then proceeding with the hull and the other components of the ship.’ In other words, their practice involved building the frame before the hull. 4 The correct answer is TRUE : The text says, ‘Rome’s navy became the largest and most powerful in the Mediterranean, and the Romans had control over what they therefore called Mare Nostrum, meaning “our sea”’. This means that Romans gave the Mediterranean this name because they dominated its use. 5 The correct answer is TRUE : The text says that rowers were ‘mostly Roman citizens enrolled in the military’. 6 The correct answer is ‘lightweight’: In the third paragraph, the text says, ‘Warships were built to be lightweight and very speedy’. ‘Speedy’ is incorrect: The summary already says that warships were designed so that they moved quickly; ‘speedy’ has the same meaning as this. 7 The correct answer is ‘bronze’: In the third paragraph, the text says, ‘They had a bronze battering ram’. ‘Timber’ is incorrect: This refers to the hulls of enemy ships. 8 The correct answer is ‘levels’ : In the fourth paragraph, the text refers to the ‘trireme’ and then says, ‘It had rowers in the top, middle and lower levels’. 9 The correct answer is ‘hull’: In the fifth paragraph, the text says that merchant ships ‘had a wider hull, double planking and a solid interior for added stability’. The word broad has the same meaning as ‘wide’. ‘Interior’ is incorrect: the text says that the interior was ‘solid’, not that it was wide. 10 The correct answer is ‘triangular’: In the fifth paragraph, the text says that merchant ships had ‘one to three masts with large square sails and a small triangular sail at the bow’. ‘Large’ is incorrect: the gap requires a word describing the shape of the sails, contrasting with ‘square’ and referring to the other type of sail (‘small triangular’). 11 The correct answer is ‘music’: In the fifth paragraph, the text says that ‘coordinating the hundreds of rowers … was not an easy task’ and then says, ‘In order to assist them, music would be played on an instrument, and oars would keep time with this.’ 12 The correct answer is ‘grain’: In the sixth paragraph, the text says, ‘The cargo on merchant ships included raw materials, (e.g. iron bars, copper, marble and granite), and agricultural products, (e.g. grain from Egypt’s Nile valley).’ 13 The correct answer is ‘towboats’: In the sixth paragraph, the text says, ‘Large merchant ships would approach the destination port and, just like today, be intercepted by a number of towboats that would drag them to the quay.’ The phrase ‘drag them to the quay’ means that these small boats pulled the merchant ships to the shore. Reading Passage 2 Questions 14–26 14 The correct answer is D: The text says, ‘Hunters would have easily misplaced arrows and they often discarded broken bows rather than take them all the way home.’ This sentence gives two reasons why hunters left weapons in the mountains: it explains about arrows that were ‘misplaced’ – in other words, lost – and bows that hunters threw away because they were broken. A is incorrect: Section A refers to ancient arrows being found on mountains, but it does not explain why they were left there. 15 The correct answer is C: The text quotes Barrett saying, ‘Fieldwork is hard work – hiking with all our equipment, often camping on permafrost’. The term ‘fieldwork’ refers to the work of archaeologists when they go to excavate ancient sites looking for evidence. F is incorrect: Section F mentions the difficulty of travelling in the mountains, but this refers to travel in the ancient past: it does not refer to present-day archaeological expeditions. 16 The correct answer is F: The text quotes Barrett referring to ‘failing agricultural harvests in time of low temperatures’ and then says, ‘A colder turn in the Scandinavian climate would likely have meant widespread crop failures’. These are both explanations about the climate becoming too cold to grow food successfully. 17 The correct answer is H: The text says that ‘archaeologists could be extracting some of those artefacts from retreating ice in years to come’. The phrase ‘in years to come’ means in the future. 18 The correct answer is G: The text refers to ‘a booming demand for hides to fight off the cold, as well as antlers to make useful things like combs.’ Hides (animal skins) and antlers are examples of two animal products which people needed and which hunters would have traded. C and E are not correct: Sections C and E mention trade but do not give any examples of items. 19 The correct answer is B: The text says, ‘glacial archaeologists need to race the clock to find newly revealed artefacts, preserve them, and study them’. The idiom ‘race against the clock’ refers to the pressure to do something quickly before time runs out. The text then gives two examples explaining why they have to work quickly: ‘If something fragile dries and is windblown it might very soon be lost to science, or an arrow might be exposed and then covered again by the next snow’. C is incorrect: Section C refers to how hard archaeologists’ work can be, but makes no mention of the pressure to work quickly. 20 The correct answer is ‘microorganisms’ or ‘micro-organisms’: In Section B, the text says, ‘Organic materials like textiles and hides are relatively rare finds at archaeological sites. This is because unless they’re protected from the microorganisms that cause decay, they tend not to last long.’ The term ‘hides’ is another word for animal skins. 21 The correct answer is ‘reindeer’: In Section C, the text refers to ‘patches of ice in Oppland’ and then says, ‘Reindeer once congregated on these icy patches in the later summer months’. The word ‘congregated’ means came together in groups, so has a similar meaning to gathered. ‘Insects’ is incorrect: The text does not say that the insects were trying to avoid anything. ‘Hunters’ is incorrect: The text does not say that hunters gathered or that they were trying to avoid anything. 22 The correct answer is ‘insects’: In Section C, the text refers to reindeer congregating on the mountains of Oppland in summer ‘to escape biting insects’. This means that they went up to the mountains to avoid being attacked by the insects. ‘Reindeer’ is incorrect: The text says that the reindeer were trying to avoid the insects, not that the insects were trying to avoid the reindeer. ‘Hunters’ is incorrect: The text does not say that the reindeer were trying to avoid hunters. 23 and 24 The correct answers are B and C: In Section F, the text says, ‘But it turned out that hunters kept regularly venturing into the mountains even when the climate turned cold’: this has the same meaning as statement B. In Section E, the text refers to some periods which produced lots of artefacts, indicating that people were active at those times and then says, ‘But there were few or no signs of activity during other periods’: this means that there were few or no artefacts in these other periods. A is incorrect: In Section D, the text mentions tools and horse tack (horse equipment) as examples of artefacts other than skis which were found in high mountain passes. D is incorrect: Radiocarbon dating is mentioned in Section E, but the text does not say anything about results being inaccurate. E is incorrect: The text does not compare the number of artefacts found in Oppland with those found in other sites. 25 and 26 The correct answers are A and C : In Section G, the text refers to ‘a booming demand for hides to fight off the cold, as well as antlers to make useful things like combs. Business must have been good for hunters.’ The phrase ‘a booming demand’ has the same meaning as an increased demand. This section also says, ‘Although we usually think of ships when we think of Scandinavian expansion, these recent discoveries show that plenty of goods travelled on overland routes, like the mountain passes of Oppland.’ This means that not all Viking goods were transported by ship: some were transported by land. B is incorrect: The text does not say when the greatest growth in the wealth of the Vikings occurred. D is incorrect: The text does not say where traders of this time came from. E is incorrect: The text does not say which area the Vikings were interested in with regard to trading links. Reading Passage 3 Questions 27–40 27 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN: In Section A, the text refers to the Cambridge scientists’ discovery and the publication of their findings, but does not mention other scientists’ reaction to this. 28 The correct answer is TRUE: In Section D, Dr Philip Wigge refers to the target for 2050 and then says, ‘but climate change is a major threat to achieving this.’ If there is a major threat to achieving something, this means that it might not be achieved. 29 The correct answer is TRUE: In Section D, the text says, ‘Key crops such as wheat and rice are sensitive to high temperatures. Thermal stress reduces crop yields by around 10% for every one degree increase in temperature’. If crop yields are reduced, this means that the crops suffer when temperatures increase. 30 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN: There is no mention of the possibility of developing crops that require less water. 31 The correct answer is FALSE: In Section E, the text says, ‘During the day, sunlight activates the molecules, slowing down growth. If a plant finds itself in shade, phytochromes are quickly inactivated – enabling it to grow faster to find sunlight again.’ This means that plants grow more slowly in sunlight than in shade. 32 The correct answer is FALSE: In Section E, the text says, ‘At night, however, it’s a different story. Instead of a rapid deactivation following sundown, the molecules gradually change from their active to inactive state.’ This means that phytochromes change their state at different speeds day and night: in the daytime, they become active or deactivated quickly, depending on light levels; by night, they change slowly, depending on temperature. 33 The correct answer is H : The text quotes Wigge saying, ‘we have outstanding collaborators nearby who work on more applied aspects of plant biology, and can help us transfer this new knowledge into the field’. This means that the collaborators’ specialised knowledge of plant biology can help the researchers take their findings out of the lab, so that they can be used in ‘the field’ – a wider, real-world context. 34 The correct answer is D: The text quotes Wigge saying, ‘‘Discovering the molecules that allow plants to sense temperature has the potential to accelerate the breeding of crops resilient to thermal stress and climate change.’ If the researchers’ discovery can speed up the development of crops that don’t suffer in rising temperatures, this would be a potential benefit. 35 The correct answer is G: The text quotes the well-known rhyme, ‘oak before ash we’ll have a splash, ash before oak we’re in for a soak’, followed by Wigge’s explanation about why this traditional saying has a scientific basis. 36 The correct answer is C: The text says, ‘Farmers and gardeners have known for hundreds of years how responsive plants are to temperature: warm winters cause many trees and flowers to bud early, something humans have long used to predict weather and harvest times for the coming year.’ This sentence mentions trees and flowers budding early as an example of plant behaviour, and says that people have long used this as an indication of future conditions: for example, in helping farmers to plan when their crops will need to be harvested. If something has been known for hundreds of years or if people have ‘long’ done something, this means that it has been done ‘traditionally’. 37 The correct answer is A: The text refers to ‘The new findings, published in the journal Science’. If researchers publish their findings in a journal, this where their research is reported. 38 The correct answer is ‘warm (winter)’: In Section G, the text says that ‘species, such as daffodils, have considerable temperature sensitivity, and can flower months in advance during a warm winter’. 39 The correct answer is ‘summer’: In Section G, the text says, ‘A warmer spring, and consequently a higher likeliness of a hot summer, will result in oak leafing before ash. A cold spring will see the opposite. As the British know only too well, a colder summer is likely to be a rain-soaked one.’ The phrase ‘a cold spring will see the opposite’ means that a cold spring will result in ash trees coming into leaf before oak trees, and that there will also be a higher chance of a cold and ‘rain-soaked’ (wet) summer. 40 The correct answer is ‘mustard plant(s)’ or ‘mustard’: In Section H, the text says, ‘The work was done in a model system, using a mustard plant called Arabidopsis.",

      "content_clean": "Reading Passage 1 Questions 1–13 1 The correct answer is TRUE : The text says, ‘There are 56 hill figures scattered around England, with the vast majority on the chalk downlands of the country’s southern counties.’ The phrase ‘the vast majority of’ means the same as most, and ‘the country’s southern counties’ is one particular area of England. 2 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN : The text says, ‘The figures include giants, horses, crosses and regimental badges.’ It does not say whether there are more figures in the shape of a horse than figures with other shapes. 3 The correct answer is TRUE : The text says, ‘The White Horse has recently been re-dated and shown to be even older than its previously assigned ancient pre-Roman Iron Age date.’ As the recent dating shows that the White Horse is even older than its previously assigned date, this means that people’s previous estimate of the White Horse’s age was incorrect. 4 The correct answer is FALSE : The text refers to the date of the Long Man of Wilmington as ‘controversial’ and says, ‘While many historians are convinced the figure is prehistoric, others believe that it was the work of an artistic monk from a nearby priory and was created between the 11th and 15th centuries.’ The fact that there are two different views among historians about the figure’s origins means that they have not come to an agreement. 5 The correct answer is FALSE : The text says, ‘The method of cutting these huge figures was simply to remove the overlying grass to reveal the gleaming white chalk below.’ This means that people did not place the chalk on the hillside: the chalk was already on the hillside, and they uncovered it by cutting away the grass that was growing on top. 6 The correct answer is TRUE : The text refers to the fact that ‘the vast majority of hill figures have disappeared’. This means that that most of these are not visible any more. 7 The correct answer is TRUE : The text says, ‘over hundreds of years the outlines would sometimes change due to people not always cutting in exactly the same place, thus creating a different shape to the original geoglyph.’ If the shapes of some geoglyphs are now different from their original shapes, this means that they have altered over time. 8 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN: The text describes the Uffington White Horse, but does not say whether its fame is due to its size. 9 The correct answer is ‘Ridgeway’ : The text says, ‘The horse is situated 2.5 km from Uffington village … and below the Ridgeway, a long-distance Neolithic track.’ A track which dates from Neolithic times is several thousand years old: this means that the Ridgeway is an ancient road. The capital ‘R’ of ‘Ridgeway’ tells us that this is the name which the road is known by. 10 The correct answer is ‘documents’ : The text says, ‘The earliest evidence of a horse at Uffington is from the 1070s CE when “White Horse Hill” is mentioned in documents from the nearby Abbey of Abingdon’. The phrase ‘earliest evidence’ means that these documents contain the first reference to White Horse Hill in existence. 11 The correct answer is ‘soil’: The text says that ‘Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) testing was carried out by the Oxford Archaeological Unit on soil from two of the lower layers of the horse’s body, and from another cut near the base.’ ‘Testing’ of soil has the same meaning as analysis of soil. 12 The correct answer is ‘fertility’: The text says that the goddess Epona ‘was worshipped as a protector of horses, and for her associations with fertility’. 13 The correct answer is ‘Rhiannon’: The text says, ‘It is possible that the carving represents a goddess in native mythology, such as Rhiannon, described in later Welsh mythology as a beautiful woman dressed in gold and riding a white horse.’ The words ‘such as’ refer back to the word ‘goddess’, indicating that Rhiannon was an example of a goddess; the capital ‘R’ of ‘Rhiannon’ indicates that this was the name of the goddess. Reading Passage 2 Questions 14–26 14 The correct answer is D : The text says, ‘Microbes, most of them bacteria, have populated this planet since long before animal life developed and they will outlive us.’ The word ‘us’ refers to animal life, including humans. The idea that microbes ‘will outlive us’ means that they will live for longer than we will: there will still be microbes on this planet when the human race no longer exists. A is incorrect: This paragraph mentions the environments where microbes live, but it does not say anything about how quickly they adapt to these environments. B is incorrect: The writer says, ‘we mess with them at our peril’, meaning that it would be dangerous for humans to interfere with microbes. This implies that the risk which they could pose is very great, and not at all exaggerated. C is incorrect: The text gives examples of both animal and plant life where microbes are found, but it does not compare them in terms of the numbers present. 15 The correct answer is C : The text says, ‘What is amazing is that while the number of human cells in the average person is about 30 trillion, the number of microbial ones is higher – about 39 trillion.’ The phrase ‘What is amazing’ tells us that the writer is impressed by the fact which follows: the writer finds it impressive that the average person has a higher number of microbial cells than human cells. A is incorrect: The writer says that each species has different microbes but does not express any opinion about this fact: we do not know whether or not the writer is impressed by this. B is incorrect: The text says that microbes vary from one part of an individual to another; it refers to varying types of microbes and does not say anything about varying numbers of microbes. D is incorrect: The text refers to scientists, but it does not say that they have limited understanding of how microbial cells behave. 16 The correct answer is A : The text describes how Antony van Leeuwenhoek designed microscopes and ‘examined a drop of water from a nearby lake and found it teeming with tiny creatures’. B is incorrect: The text refers to two scientists but does not compare their theories. C is incorrect: The text refers to two scientists but does not mention any confusion. D is incorrect: The text refers to the fact that some microbes cause disease but does not give any details about this. 17 The correct answer is G: ‘Disease’ has a similar meaning to illness. In the sixth paragraph, the text says that ‘while fewer than one hundred species of bacteria bring disease, many thousands more play a vital role in maintaining our health’. This compares the number of bacteria which lead to illness with the number which help keep us healthy. The ‘fewer than one hundred’ bacteria species which cause disease is relatively small in comparison to the thousands which maintain our health. 18 The correct answer is B : The text says, ‘bacteria should not be viewed as either friends or foes, villains or heroes. Instead we should realise we have a symbiotic relationship, that can be mutually beneficial or mutually destructive.’ ‘Foes’ means enemies, so the text is saying that we should not think of bacteria as either our friends or our enemies. We should think of them as a species with which we have a ‘symbiotic’ relationship: this is when different species co-exist together in close association, similar to a partnership. 19 The correct answer is H : In the seventh paragraph, the text refers to ‘our unhealthy, low-fibre diets’ as one of several factors contributing to the increase in allergies and immune system problems. Our ‘diets’ are what we eat and drink, and this word has a similar meaning to nutrition. If our diet is ‘unhealthy’, this means that our nutrition is poor. E is incorrect: The word cleanliness does not fit in this part of the sentence because the text does not say that our standard of cleanliness is poor. 20 The correct answer is E : In the seventh paragraph, the text refers to ‘Our obsession with hygiene’ as one of several factors contributing to the increase in allergies and immune system problems. If people have an ‘obsession with hygiene’, this means that they focus far too much on keeping themselves clean. H is incorrect: The word ‘nutrition’ does not fit in this part of the sentence because the text does not say that we focus too much on nutrition. 21 The correct answer is YES : In the eighth paragraph, the writer says, ‘there are studies indicating that the excessive use of household detergents and antibacterial products actually destroys the microbes that normally keep the more dangerous germs at bay’. The writer suggests that using antibacterial products may not lead to the result that we want: we use the products to kill dangerous germs, but in fact they might be killing the microbes which keep us safe from these germs. If these products do not keep us safe from dangerous germs, they are failing to have the desired effect. 22 The correct answer is NO : In the eighth paragraph, the writer says, ‘Other studies show that keeping a dog as a pet gives children early exposure to a diverse range of bacteria, which may help protect them against allergies later.’ The phrase ‘exposure to a diverse range of bacteria’ means ‘contact with many different types of bacteria’. In other words, the writer thinks that children may get protection against allergies if they are exposed to as many bacteria as possible when they are young. It is therefore not a good idea to ensure they come into contact with as few bacteria as possible. 23 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN : In the ninth paragraph, the writer refers to several case studies in Yong’s book but does not give an opinion about whether there are too many or too few case studies included. 24 The correct answer is YES : In the ninth paragraph, the writer says that the study involving fungus and frogs is ‘Among the less appealing case studies’. The writer then goes on to say, ‘Another is about squid that carry luminescent bacteria that protect them against predators.’ The word ‘Another’ refers back to the phrase ‘Among the less appealing case studies’; this means that the writer thinks the case study about bacteria and squid is also one of the less appealing ones. In other words, this case study is somewhat dull, or even unpleasant, and may therefore have limited appeal for readers. 25 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN: In the ninth paragraph, the writer refers to an attempt to stop mosquitoes spreading dengue fever but does not say whether this has been successful. 26 The correct answer is NO : In the ninth paragraph, the writer says, ‘In the future, our ability to manipulate microbes means we could construct buildings with useful microbes built into their walls to fight off infections’, and then mentions a hospital ward as an example of a possible location where we could imagine this happening. This means that microbes which reduce the risk of infection have not yet been put in the walls of hospital wards. Reading Passage 3 Questions 27–40 27 The correct answer is B : The writer says that wisdom ‘isn’t an exceptional trait possessed by a small handful of bearded philosophers after all’. The phrase ‘isn’t … after all’ indicates that this idea was believed until recently, but now research suggests that it may be wrong. This point is then reinforced by the phrase ‘in fact’, which introduces the findings of the research. A is incorrect: The writer says that wisdom is ‘one of the most revered human qualities’ but does not suggest that it is unique to humans. C is incorrect: The writer refers to different concepts of wisdom but does not relate these to society. D is incorrect: The writer refers to recent findings about the nature of wisdom but does not say whether there is more to be discovered. 28 The correct answer is C : Igor Grossmann is quoted as saying, ‘It appears that experiential, situational, and cultural factors are even more powerful in shaping wisdom than previously imagined’. This means that people did not previously realise how powerful the influence of these factors was. In other words, their importance was underestimated. A is incorrect: Grossmann suggests that a person’s ability to make wise decisions ‘varies dramatically across experiential and situational contexts’; he does not suggest that this varies from one person to another. B is incorrect: Grossman does not say anything about earlier research. D is incorrect: Grossman refers to several branches of psychology but does not suggest that they have different definitions of wisdom. 29 The correct answer is B : Grossmann is quoted as saying, ‘wisdom … unfolds as a function of situations people happen to be in. Some situations are more likely to promote wisdom than others.’ This means that a person will show more wisdom in some circumstances than in others. A is incorrect: Grossman does not mention what people think about their own level of wisdom. C is incorrect: Grossman claims that an individual’s level of wisdom depends on ‘a variety of external factors’; he does not suggest that personality is a determining factor. D is incorrect: Grossman does not say anything about wisdom developing over time. 30 The correct answer is D : The fourth paragraph lists four characteristics identified as being associated with wise reasoning; the writer is implying that people can use these to help them reason wisely. A is incorrect: There is no mention of any difficulties. B is incorrect: There is no mention of any specific type of person. C is incorrect: There is no mention of any controversial view. 31 The correct answer is D : The fourth paragraph refers to the four characteristics in the framework of wise reasoning and says, ‘One is intellectual humility or recognition of the limits of our own knowledge’. ‘Humility’ has a similar meaning to modesty, and the ‘recognition of the limits’ of something has a similar meaning to modesty regarding the extent of it. 32 The correct answer is A : The fourth paragraph mentions ‘compromise or integration of different attitudes and beliefs’ as being a characteristic in the framework of wise reasoning. Someone who integrates different attitudes and beliefs into their decisions is taking into account opinions which may not be the same as their own. ‘View’ is incorrect: While view can have a similar meaning to opinions, this word does not fit grammatically. View is a singular countable noun; this gap requires a plural or uncountable noun. 33 The correct answer is C : The fourth paragraph mentions ‘appreciation of perspectives wider than the issue at hand’ as being a characteristic in the framework of wise reasoning. This has a similar meaning to taking a broad view. ‘Opinions’ is incorrect: While opinions can have a similar meaning to ‘view’, this word does not fit grammatically. Opinions is a plural noun; this gap requires a singular countable noun. 34 The correct answer is F : The fifth paragraph suggests that ‘one of the most reliable ways to support wisdom in our own day-to-day decisions is to look at scenarios from a third-party perspective, as though giving advice to a friend’. This is a recommendation to regard scenarios in a detached way, as if from another person’s viewpoint: in other words, to look at them with objectivity. 35 The correct answer is G: The fifth paragraph suggests that taking a third-person perspective helps people ‘focus more on interpersonal and moral ideals such as justice and impartiality’. The concepts of ‘justice and impartiality’ have a similar meaning to fairness. 36 The correct answer is FALSE : The text says, ‘The students were instructed to imagine their career either “as if you were a distant observer” or “before your own eyes as if you were right there”.’ It then refers to participants being ‘assigned’ to particular groups. Both of these statements indicate that the students were given no choice about the perspective to take. 37 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN : The text describes how the couples experiment was conducted but does not mention whether the participants were aware that the study was about wise reasoning. 38 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN : The text says that the ‘perspectives’ taken by the participants had an impact on the results; it does not say whether the length of the couples’ relationships had any impact on these. 39 The correct answer is TRUE : The text says of the job prospects experiment that ‘Participants in the group assigned to the “distant observer” role displayed more wisdomrelated reasoning (intellectual humility and recognition of change) than did participants in the control group’; it says of the couples experiment that ‘Couples in the “other’s eyes” condition were significantly more likely to rely on wise reasoning – recognizing others’ perspectives and searching for a compromise – compared to the couples in the egocentric condition.’ This means that the two experiments produced the same results: in both cases, the participants who took the wiser decisions were those who looked at the situation from a detached viewpoint. 40 The correct answer is TRUE : The final paragraph says, ‘We might associate wisdom with intelligence or particular personality traits, but research shows only a small positive relationship between wise thinking and crystallized intelligence’. If there is ‘only a small positive relationship’ between wisdom and intelligence, this means that the former is determined by the latter to only a very limited extent. The text then quotes Grossmann expanding on this point, saying, ‘It is remarkable how much people can vary in their wisdom from one situation to the next, and how much stronger such contextual effects are for understanding the relationship between wise judgment and its social and affective outcomes as compared to the generalized “traits”.’ This indicates that Grossman agrees with this view.",

      "content_clean": "Reading Passage 1 Questions 1–13 1 The correct answer is FALSE : The text refers to the layer of fat under polar bears’ skin and the fact that ‘Humans with comparative levels of adipose tissue would be considered obese and would be likely to suffer from diabetes and heart disease.’ It then contrasts humans and polar bears, saying ‘Yet the polar bear experiences no such consequences.’ The phrase ‘no such consequences’ refers back to obesity, diabetes and heart disease in humans: this means that polar bears do not suffer these health problems as a result of their fat. 2 The correct answer is FALSE : The text says that the study by Liu and colleagues ‘compared the genetic structure of polar bears with that of their closest relatives from a warmer climate, the brown bears.’ In other words, they compared two different species of bear; they did not compare two different groups of polar bears. 3 The correct answer is NOT GIVEN : The text says that Liu and colleagues compared polar bears and brown bears genetically, but it does not say whether they were the first researchers to do this. 4 The correct answer is TRUE : The text says, ‘Liu and his colleagues found the polar bears had a gene known as APoB, which reduces levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) – a form of “bad” cholesterol.’ Having a gene which reduces the levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol has the same meaning as controlling this by genetic means. 5 The correct answer is TRUE : The text describes how female polar bears remain in dens in the snow throughout the winter and then says, ‘This process results in six months of fasting, where the female bears have to keep themselves and their cubs alive’. The word ‘fasting’ means living without food for a period. 6 The correct answer is FALSE : The text refers to the period which female polar bears spend in their den over the winter and then says, ‘Despite this, their bones remain strong and dense’. It also refers to Lennox and Goodship’s findings that ‘six months later, when they finally emerged from the den with their cubs, there was no evidence of significant loss of bone density’. 7 The correct answer is TRUE : The text says, ‘If the mechanism of bone remodelling in polar bears can be understood, many bedridden humans, and even astronauts, could potentially benefit.’ These are two examples of groups of people who could benefit from scientific developments based on the polar bear’s mechanism for increasing bone density. 8 The correct answer is ‘violent’ : The text says, ‘Bears … seem to be perceived as stupid and in many cases violent.’ 9 The correct answer is ‘tool’ : The text says, ‘A male bear called GoGo in Tennoji Zoo, Osaka, has even been observed making use of a tool to manipulate his environment. The bear used a tree branch on multiple occasions to dislodge a piece of meat hung out of his reach.’ The second sentence adds information to the first, specifying what the tool was and how the bear manipulated his environment; it explains that that the ‘tool’ mentioned in the first sentence was a ‘tree branch’. 10 The correct answer is ‘meat’: The text says, ‘A male bear called GoGo in Tennoji Zoo, Osaka, has even been observed making use of a tool to manipulate his environment. The bear used a tree branch on multiple occasions to dislodge a piece of meat hung out of his reach.’ The word ‘dislodge’ has a similar meaning to ‘knock down’ in this context: the bear used the branch to reach upwards and knock the piece of meat out of the tree. 11 The correct answer is ‘photographer’: The text says, ‘A calculated move by a male bear involved running and jumping onto barrels in an attempt to get to a photographer standing on a platform four metres high.’ 12 The correct answer is ‘game’: The text refers to Ames’s study and says that she ‘observed bears putting objects in piles and then knocking them over in what appeared to be a game’. 13 The correct answer is ‘frustration’: The text says, ‘many bears have been seen to hit out at ice and snow – seemingly out of frustration – when they have just missed out on a kill’. Reading Passage 2 Questions 14–26 14 The correct answer is iv, ‘A single certainty among other less definite facts’: The text mentions that ‘The evolution of the pyramid form has been written and argued about for centuries.’ This means that people do not agree about the evolution of the pyramid form. It then says, ‘However, there is no question that, as far as Egypt is concerned, it began with one monument to one king designed by one brilliant architect: the Step Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara.’ The phrase ‘there is no question’ means that although there is a lack of certainty about other subjects, this one fact is certain. ix is incorrect: This paragraph refers to questions, but there is no mention of unexpected questions. 15 The correct answer is vii, ‘An idea for changing the design of burial structures’: The text describes the design of tombs before the reign of Djoser, then says that Djoser’s main official, Imhotep, ‘conceived of building a taller, more impressive tomb for his king by stacking stone slabs on top of one another, progressively making them smaller, to form the shape now known as the Step Pyramid’. A burial structure is a synonym for ‘tomb’, and if someone conceives of something, this means that they had an idea or invented something new. iii is incorrect: This paragraph tells us about a king, but it does not say that he saved his people. 16 The correct answer is ii, ‘A difficult task for those involved’: The text mentions that ‘Much experimentation was involved’, which suggests that the construction of the pyramid was not a simple task. It then says, ‘The weight of the enormous mass was a challenge for the builders’. If something is a challenge, it means that it is not easy to do. 17 The correct answer is v, ‘An overview of the external buildings and areas’: The text refers to the size of the Step Pyramid and the area it occupied, as well as the purpose of certain buildings, such as the temple. It also describes the outer wall and trench surrounding the complex. This paragraph is therefore an overview – a general description – of the outside of the pyramid site. i is incorrect: This paragraph does not refer to anything inside the pyramid. 18 The correct answer is i, ‘The areas and artefacts within the pyramid itself’: This paragraph begins by describing how different sections inside the pyramid – the burial chamber, tunnels and rooms – were arranged. It then describes some artefacts: the stone vessels which were found inside the pyramid. v is incorrect: This paragraph describes the areas inside the pyramid, not the external areas. 19 The correct answer is viii, ‘An incredible experience despite the few remains’: The text refers to ancient robbers, saying that ‘all archaeologists found were a small number of [Djoser’s] valuables overlooked by the thieves’. This means that there were few objects left in the pyramid. But it then goes on to say, ‘There was enough left throughout the pyramid and its complex, however, to astonish and amaze the archaeologists who excavated it.’ This tells us that even though there were few remains, the archaeologists still thought the discovery of them was amazing. 20 The correct answer is vi, ‘A pyramid design that others copied’: The text says that the Step Pyramid ‘became the archetype which all the other great pyramid builders of Egypt would follow’. This means that all the other great pyramid builders copied the design of the Step Pyramid. 21 The correct answer is ‘city’: In Paragraph D, the text refers to the Step Pyramid and then says, ‘The complex in which it was built was the size of a city in ancient Egypt’. 22 The correct answer is ‘priests’: In Paragraph D, the text says that the complex ‘included a temple, courtyards, shrines and living quarters for the priests’. The phrase ‘living quarters’ has the same meaning as accommodation. 23 The correct answer is ‘trench’: In Paragraph D, the text says, ‘the entire wall was then ringed by a trench 750 meters long and 40 meters wide’. If something rings another thing, it means that it goes all around it or encircles it. 24 The correct answer is ‘location’: In Paragraph D, the text refers to the false doors and then says, ‘If someone wished to enter, he or she would have needed to know in advance how to find the location of the true opening in the wall.’ This means that if visitors did not know the location of the real door, they would not have been able to enter. 25 and 26 The correct answers are B and D (in either order): B is correct because in Paragraph B, the text says, ‘Djoser is thought to have reigned for 19 years, but some historians and scholars attribute a much longer time for his rule, owing to the number and size of the monuments he built.’ This means that not everyone agrees about how long Djoser’s reign was: some people think it was 20 years, while others think that it was much longer. D is correct because in Paragraph F, the text says, ‘Djoser’s grave goods, and even his body, were stolen at some point in the past and all archaeologists found were a small number of his valuables overlooked by the thieves.’ If the archaeologists found ‘a small number of his valuables’, this means that they found a few of his possessions in his tomb. A is incorrect: In Paragraph B, the text says that the Step Pyramid was built in stone rather than clay, but it does not say whether King Djoser had to be persuaded to use stone. B is incorrect: In Paragraph D, the text says that Djoser was very proud of Imhotep’s accomplishment. E is incorrect: The text does not say anything about Djoser’s attitude towards other pyramids. Reading Passage 3 Questions 27–40 27 The correct answer is B: The text says, ‘3–14% of the global workforce will need to switch to a different occupation within the next 10–15 years, and all workers will need to adapt as their occupations evolve alongside increasingly capable machines’. This sentence tells us how many people will have to change the job that they do or the way that they work. The text then refers to AI as ‘one aspect of the disruptive effects of technology on the labour market’, meaning that AI is one of the causes of this change. A is incorrect: This paragraph tells us about the proportion of the labour force who will have to change their jobs because of AI; it does not specify what kinds of jobs these will be. C is incorrect: This paragraph tells us about the proportion of the labour force who will have to change their jobs because of AI; it does not say how many will have jobs in AI. D is incorrect: This paragraph explains the distinction between embodied and disembodied AI but does not say anything about their different impacts on workers. 28 The correct answer is D: The text says that Stella Pachidi ‘believes that some of the most fundamental changes are happening as a result of the “algorithmication” of jobs that are dependent on data rather than on production – the so-called knowledge economy’. If something results in fundamental changes in a particular area, this means that it is a key factor in current developments there. A is incorrect: This paragraph gives examples of the tasks previously needing human judgement which algorithms can now do, but it doesn’t say whether Pachidi believes this is having an influence the number of jobs available. B is incorrect: This paragraph does not say anything about people’s attitudes towards their occupations. C is incorrect: The text makes no reference to a decline in the production sector. 29 The correct answer is C: The text says, ‘Pachidi and colleagues even observed people developing strategies to make the algorithm work to their own advantage,’ and then quotes Pachidi saying, ‘We are seeing cases where workers feed the algorithm with false data to reach their targets’. If workers are giving the algorithm false data in order to reach their targets, this is a way of making sure that it produces the results that they want. A is incorrect: The text does not say that staff disagreed with the recommendations of AI. B is incorrect: The text does not say what the staff’s attitude towards AI was. D is incorrect: The text does not say that staff allowed AI to carry out tasks that they ought to do themselves. 30 The correct answer is D: The text refers to Ewan McGaughey’s research and then quotes him saying, ‘History is clear that change can mean redundancies. But social policies can tackle this through retraining and redeployment.’ The word ‘tackle’ has a similar meaning to handle. McGaughey gives the examples of retraining and redeploying workers as illustrations of ways that social policies can successfully handle changes in the job market. A is incorrect: What McGaughey challenges is the idea that new technologies are entirely to blame for unemployment: he acknowledges that redundancy is a negative thing and gives his views on how to deal with it. B is incorrect: The text refers to unemployment but does not say anything about the effect of mass unemployment on society. C is incorrect: The text refers to past and future job losses but does not compare them. 31 The correct answer is G: In the second paragraph, the text quotes Stella Pachidi talking about ‘the “algorithmication” of jobs that are dependent on data rather than on production’. Saying that jobs are ‘dependent on data’ is the same as saying that they rely on information. 32 The correct answer is E: In the sixth paragraph, the text refers to Pachidi’s observations that workers sometimes begin to ‘learn through the “algorithm’s eyes” and become dependent on its instructions’. Becoming ‘dependent’ on AI’s instructions means the same as having a growing reliance on its recommendations. 33 The correct answer is C: In the sixth paragraph, the text says, ‘Alternative explorations – where experimentation and human instinct lead to progress and new ideas – are effectively discouraged.’ ‘Instinct’ has a similar meaning to intuition, ‘progress and new ideas’ has a similar meaning to innovation, and ‘discouraged’ has a similar meaning to prevented. The text is therefore saying that using experimentation and human instinct is discouraged in the workplace. 34 The correct answer is F: In the eighth paragraph, the text refers to the researchers and says, ‘Their objective is to make AI technologies more trustworthy and transparent, so that organisations and individuals understand how AI decisions are made.’ Having trust in something is a synonym for having confidence in something, so trying to make AI technology ‘more trustworthy’ has the same meaning as trying to increase people’s confidence in it. 35 The correct answer is B: In the tenth paragraph, Hamish Low refers to the effect of automation in the future and says, ‘The number of jobs will increase’. 36 The correct answer is A: In the third paragraph, Stella Pachidi says, ‘Organisations are attracted to using algorithms because they want to make choices based on what they consider is “perfect information”, as well as to reduce costs and enhance productivity.’ The phrase ‘Organisations are attracted to using algorithms’ has the same meaning as AI is appealing to businesses. Pachidi then goes on to give three reasons for this. 37 The correct answer is C: In the final paragraph, Ewan McGaughey says, ‘Just as the industrial revolution brought people past subsistence agriculture, and the corporate revolution enabled mass production, a third revolution has been pronounced.’ The industrial revolution and the corporate revolution are two major cultural shifts that occurred in previous centuries, and McGaughey highlights the parallels between the impact of these events and that of the current AI-driven changes by using the phrase ‘Just as’. 38 The correct answer is A: In the fourth paragraph, Stella Pachidi says, ‘But these enhancements are not without consequences’. The word ‘enhancements’ refers back to the advantages of algorithms mentioned in the previous paragraph. Pachidi then goes on to mention several negative consequences of AI in the workplace. 39 The correct answer is B: In the ninth paragraph, Hamish Low says, ‘The traditional trajectory of full-time education followed by full-time work followed by a pensioned retirement is a thing of the past.’ A ‘traditional trajectory’ has a similar meaning to a conventional path, and the phrase ‘a thing of the past’ means that this no longer exists. Low is therefore saying that career paths are now different from the conventional ones that people used to follow. 40 The correct answer is C: In the 13th paragraph, the text says, ‘McGaughey’s findings are a call to arms to leaders of organisations, governments and banks to pre-empt the coming changes with bold new policies that guarantee full employment, fair incomes and a thriving economic democracy.’ If something is ‘a call to arms’, it is calling on people to take action or measures. McGaughey’s findings are therefore encouraging authorities such as governments to make sure that there will be full employment and fair incomes: in other words, adequately paid work for everyone",

The answer-finding process is similar to other questions – find the keywords in the text and look around it. This question doesn’t necessarily maintain any sequence.] Which THREE of the following statements are true of Johnson’s Dictionary? A. It avoided all scholarly words. B. It was the only English dictionary in general use for 200 years. C. It was famous because of the large number of people involved. D. It focused mainly on language from contemporary texts. E. There was a time limit for its completion. F. It ignored work done by previous dictionary writers. G. It took into account subtleties of meaning. H. Its definitions were famous for their originality. Keywords for the question: THREE, true, Johnson’s Dictionary, Answers to questions 1-3 can all be found in paragraph no. 6. Let’s have a look there. In the first few lines of paragraph no. 6, the writer says, “The work was immense; filling about .. . … . Johnson wrote the definitions of over 40,000 words, and illustrated their many meanings with some 114.000 quotations drawn from English writing on every subject, from the Elizabethans to his own time.” Here, his own time = contemporary, This line matches with – D. It focused mainly on language from contemporary texts. Also, in the same paragraph, look at lines 8-9, “ . .. He did not expect to achieve complete originality. Working to a deadline, he had to draw . .. . .. .” Here, Working to a deadline = There was a time limit, This line matches with – E. There was a time limit for its completion. Once again, in paragraph no. 6, take a look at these lines (13-16), “ . .. . Unlike his predecessors, Johnson treated English very practically, as a living language, with many different shades of meaning. Here, many different shades of meaning = subtleties of meaning, This line matches with – G. It took into account subtleties of meaning. So, the answers are: (in any order) D, E, G Questions 4-7: Summary completion [In this kind of question candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers to fill in the gaps.] Question no. 4: In 1764 Dr Johnson accepted the contract to produce a dictionary. Having rented a garret, he took on a number of __________ who stood at a long central desk. Keywords for the question: 1764, Dr Johnson, accepted, contract, to produce, dictionary, rented, garret, took on, a number of, who, stood, long central desk, At the end of paragraph no. 4, the author writes, “ . . .. Johnson signed the contract for the Dictionary with the bookseller Robert Dosley at a breakfast held at the Golden Anchor Inn near Holbom Bar on 18 June 1764. He was to be paid £ 1.575 in instalments, and from this he took money to rent 17 Gough Square, in which he set up his ‘dictionary workshop’.” Here, Johnson signed the contract for the Dictionary = Dr Johnson accepted the contract to produce a dictionary, Then, at the beginning of paragraph no. 5, the author says, “James Boswell, his biographer described the garret where Johnson worked as ‘fitted up like a counting house’ with a long desk running down the middle at which the copying clerks would work standing up. . .. . .” Here, work standing up = stood at, So, the answer is: (copying) clerks Question no. 5: Johnson did not have a _________ available to him, but eventually produced definitions of in excess of 40,000 words written down in 80 large notebooks. Keywords for the question: did not have, eventually, produced, definitions, in excess of, 40000 words, written down, 80 large notebooks, The answer can be found in paragraph no.6. At the beginning of the paragraph, the author mentions, “The work was immense; filling about eighty large notebooks (and without a library to hand). Johnson wrote the definitions of over 40,000 words, . .. .. .” Here, without = did not have, to hand = available, So, the answer is: library Question no. 6: On publication, the Dictionary was immediately hailed in many European countries as a landmark. According to his biographer, James Boswell, Johnson’s principal achievement was to bring ___________ to the English language. Keywords for the question: immediately hailed, European countries, landmark, biographer, James Boswell, principal achievement, bring, to the English language, In paragraph no. 7, the writer says, “After many vicissitudes the Dictionary was finally published on 15 April 1775. It was instantly recognised as a landmark throughout Europe. . . .. .” Here, instantly recognised = immediately hailed, throughout Europe = in many European countries, Then, at the end of paragraph no. 8, we find the comment of James Boswell, “ . .. .. It is the corner-stone of Standard English, an achievement which, in James Boswell’s words, ‘conferred stability on the language of his country’.” Here, in James Boswell’s words = According to his biographer James Boswell, conferred = was to bring, on the language of his country = to the English language, So, the answer is: stability Question no. 7: As a reward for his hard work, he was granted a _________ by the king. Keywords for the question: reward, for, hard work, granted, by the King, In the last paragraph (paragraph no. 9), the author says, “The Dictionary, together with his other writing, made Johnson famous and so well esteemed that his friends were able to prevail upon King George III to offer him a pension. .. .” Here, offer him = he was granted, King George III = the King, So, the answer is: pension Questions 8-13: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 8: The growing importance of the middle classes led to an increased demand for dictionaries. Keywords for the question: growing importance, middle classes, led to, increased demand, dictionaries, In paragraph no. 3, the first few lines say, “Beyond the practical need to make order out of chaos, the rise of dictionaries is associated with the rise of the English middle class, who were anxious to define and circumscribe the various worlds to conquer – lexical as well as social and commercial. .. .. .” Here, rise of the English middle class = growing importance of the middle classes, associated with = led to, the rise of dictionaries = increased demand for dictionaries, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 9: Johnson has become more well known since his death. Keywords for the question: Johnson, become, more well known, since, death, In paragraph no. 3, lines 8-13 say, “ . .. . It is highly appropriate that Dr Samuel Johnson, the very model of an eighteenth-century literary man, as famous in his own time as in ours, should have published his dictionary at the very beginning of the heyday of the middle class.” Here, as famous in his own time as in ours = Johnson was as well known in his time as after his death, not more, not less, So, the question contradicts the information in the text. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 10: Johnson had been planning to write a dictionary for several years. Keywords for the question: Johnson, planning to write, dictionary, several years, Paragraph no. 4 talks about Johnson’s decision about writing a dictionary. However, it doesn’t mention anywhere whether he had been planning to write it for several years or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 11: Johnson set up an academy to help with the writing of his Dictionary. Keywords for the question: Johnson, set up, academy, to help, writing of his Dictionary, At the end of paragraph no. 4, the writer says, “… .. . He was to be paid £ 1,575 in instalments, and from this he took money to rent 17 Gough Square, in which he set up his ‘dictionary workshop’.” Here, dictionary workshop = not an academy, So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 12: Johnson only received payment for his Dictionary on its completion. Keywords for the question: Johnson, only received, payment, for, Dictionary, on its completion, Again, in the same lines, the author says, “ . .. . He was to be paid £ 1,575 in instalments, and from this he took money to rent 17 Gough Square, in which he set up his ‘dictionary workshop’.” This means Dr Johnson had already taken money from the amount he was to be paid. So, he already received money before the completion of the Dictionary project. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 13: Not all of the assistants survived to see the publication of the Dictionary. Keywords for the question: not, all, assistants, survived, to see, publication, Dictionary, At the end of paragraph no. 5, the author says, “ . .. . He was also helped by six assistants, two of whom died whilst the Dictionary was still in preparation.” Here, two of whom died whilst the Dictionary was still in preparation = two of the assistants died before the publication of the Dictionary, means two of them did not survive, So, the answer is: TRUE Reading Passage 2: Questions 14-26 The headline of the passage: Nature or Nurture? Questions 14-19: Identifying information [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question no. 14: a biological explanation of the teacher-subjects’ behaviour Keywords for the question: biological explanation, teacher-subjects’ behaviour, At the beginning of paragraph F, the writer provides a biological explanation of the behaviour displayed by the teacher-subjects, “One’s first inclination might be to argue that there must be some sort of built-in animal aggression instinct that was activated by the experiment, and that Milgram’s teacher- subjects were just following a genetic need to discharge this pent-up primal urge onto the pupil by administering the electrical shock. .. ..” Here, some sort of built-in animal aggression instinct teacher- subjects were just following a genetic need = biological explanation about the teacher-subjects’ behaviour, So, the answer is: F Question no. 15: the explanation Milgram gave the teacher-subjects for the experiment Keywords for the question: explanation, Milgram gave, teacher-subjects, for, experiment, The last half of paragraph A gives us the answer, “. .. .. . Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer ‘teacher-subject’ that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils’ ability to learn.” Here, Milgram told each volunteer ‘teacher-subject’ = the explanation Milgram gave the teacher-subjects, So, the answer is: A Question no. 16: the identity of the pupils Keywords for the question: identity, pupils, In paragraph B, we can find the identity of the pupils in line no. 6, “ . .. . The supposed ‘pupil‘ was in reality an actor hired by Milgram . . .. .” Here, an actor = the identity of the pupils, So, the answer is: B Question no. 17: the expected statistical outcome Keywords for the question: expected, statistical outcome, The answer can be found in paragraph D. Take a close look at the last half of the paragraph, “ . .. . . The overwhelming consensus was that virtually all the teacher-subjects would refuse to obey the experimenter. The psychiatrists felt that ‘most subjects would not go beyond 150 volts’ and they further anticipated that only four per cent would go up to 300 volts. Furthermore, they thought that only a lunatic fringe of about one in 1.000 would give the highest shock of 450 volts.” Here, consensus = expected statistical outcome, Then the writer provides some figures about what people would do regarding providing electric shocks to test subjects. So, the answer is: D Question no. 18: the general aim of sociobiological study Keywords for the question: general aim, sociobiological study, The last few lines of paragraph I provides the answer, “ . .. Put another way, sociobiology is concerned with elucidating the biological basis of all behaviour.” Here, is concerned with = general aim, So, the answer is: I Question no. 19: the way Milgram persuaded the teacher-subjects to continue Keywords for the question: way, Milgram, persuaded, teacher-subjects, continue, The answer lies in paragraph C. The writer says in lines 3-7, “ . .. .. . Many of the teacher-subjects balked at administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram with questioning locks and/or complaints about continuing the experiment. In these situations, Milgram calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to ignore the pupil’s cries for mercy and carry on with the experiment. .. .. .” Here, Milgram calmly explained = Milgram persuaded the teacher-subjects calmly, So, the answer is: C Questions 20-22: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers for previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question no. 20: The teacher-subjects were told that they were testing whether – Keywords for the question: teacher-subjects, were told, testing whether, We can find the answer in lines 5-7 of paragraph A, “ . .. .. Milgram told each volunteer ‘teacher-subject’ that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils’ ability to learn.” Here, punishing pupils for their mistakes = punishment, positive effect = helps, ability to learn = learning, So, the answer is: B (punishment helps learning.) Question no. 21: The teacher-subjects were instructed to – Keywords for the question: teacher-subjects, were instructed, The answer can be found in the last lines of paragraph B, “ . .. . Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was called for, as per the rule governing the experimental situation of the moment.” Here, to administer whatever level of shock was called for = give punishment, as per the rule = according to a rule, So, the answer is: D (give punishment according to a rule.) Question no. 22: Before the experiment took place the psychiatrists – Keywords for the question: before, experiment took place, psychiatrists, To find the answer to this question we have to look at two paragraphs. First, take a look at paragraph D where we find the mention of psychiatrists, “Prior to carrying out the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of 39 psychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people in an ordinary population who would be willing to administer the highest shock level of 450 volts. The overwhelming consensus was that virtually all the teacher-subjects would refuse to obey the experimenter. . .. . .” These lines suggest that the psychiatrists predicted that no teacher-subjects were willing to obey the experimenter. However, in the following paragraph (paragraph E), the writer says at the beginning, “What were the actual results? Well, over 60 per cent of the teacher-subjects continued to obey Milgram up to the 450-volt limit! . .. .” These lines suggest that a big number of the teacher-subjects actually continued to obey the experimenter (Milgram). This means the psychiatrists underestimated the teacher-subjects’ willingness to comply with experimental procedure. So, the answer is: C (underestimated the teacher-subjects’ willingness to comply with experimental procedure.) Questions 23-26: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 23: Several of the subjects were psychology students at Yale University. Keywords for the question: several, subjects, psychology students, Yale University, In paragraph A, the writer talks about the teacher-subjects in lines 5-6, “ . .. Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer ‘teacher-subject’ that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, . .. . .” Here, we have no clue about the identity of the teacher-subjects. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 24: Some people may believe that the teacher-subjects’ behaviour could be explained as a positive survival mechanism. Keywords for the question: some people, may believe, teacher-subjects’ behaviour, could be explained, as, positive, survival mechanism, To find the answer to this question, we have to travel all the way to paragraph F where we find about a claim made by someone, “ . .. . A modern hard-core sociobiologist might even go so far as to claim that this aggressive instinct evolved as an advantageous trait, having been of survival value to our ancestors in their struggle against the hardships of life on the plains and in the caves, ultimately finding its way into our genetic make-up as a remnant of our ancient animal ways.” Here, aggressive instinct = teacher-subjects’ behaviour, an advantageous trait = a positive survival mechanism, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 25: In a sociological explanation, personal values are more powerful than authority. Keywords for the question: sociological explanation, personal values, more powerful, than authority, Have a close look at these lines from paragraph H, “Thus, in this explanation the subject merges his unique personality and personal and moral code with that of larger institutional structures, surrendering individual properties like loyalty, self-sacrifice and discipline to the service of malevolent systems of authority.” Here, merges = as equal as, unique personality and personal and moral code = personal values, So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 26: Milgram’s experiment solves an important question in sociobiology. Keywords for the question: Milgram’s experiment, solves, important question, sociobiology, The answer can be found in paragraph I in the first few lines, “Here we have two radically different explanations for why so many teacher-subjects were willing to forgo their sense of personal responsibility for the sake of an institutional authority figure. The problem for biologists, psychologists and anthropologists is to sort out which of these two polar explanations is more plausible. . .. ..” This means biologists, psychologists and anthropologists are not sure about which explanation is more plausible or reasonable. So, Milgram’s experiment did not solve the question in sociobiology. So, the answer is: FALSE Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40 The headline of the passage: The Truth about the Environment Questions 27-32: YES, NO, NOT GIVEN: [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 27: Environmentalists take a pessimistic view of the world for a number of reasons. Keywords for the question: Environmentalists, pessimistic view, world, for, a number of reasons, The answer can be found in the first paragraph, “For many environmentalists, the world seems to be getting worse. They have developed a hit-list of our main fears: that natural resources are running out; that the population is ever growing, leaving less and less to eat; that species are becoming extinct in vast numbers, and that the planet’s air and water are becoming ever more polluted.” Here, the world seems to be getting worse = pessimistic view, main fears = a number of reasons, So, the answer is: YES Question no. 28: Data on the Earth’s natural resources has only been collected since 1972. Keywords for the question: data, Earth’s natural resources, only, been collected, since 1972, In the second paragraph, the writer says in the beginning, “But a quick look at the facts shows a different picture. First, energy and other natural resources have become more abundant, not less so, since the book The Limits to Growth’ was published in 1972 by a group of scientists. … .” The lines suggest that a book was published in 1972. However, there is no information about when the data on the Earth’s natural resources were collected. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 29: The number of starving people in the world has increased in recent years. Keywords for the question: number of starving people, world, increased, recent years, In the second paragraph, the writer says in lines 3-5, “ … . Second, more food is now produced per head of the world’s population than at any time in history. Fewer people are starving. . .. . .” Here, Fewer people are starving = the number of starving people …. has decreased in recent years, So, the answer is: NO Question no. 30: Extinct species are being replaced by new species. Keywords for the question: extinct species, being replaced, new species, Lines 4-6 in paragraph no. 2 says, “ .. . Third, although species are indeed becoming extinct, only about 0.7% of them are expected to disappear in the next 50 years, not 25-50%, as has so often been predicted.. . .. .” Here, the writer confesses that species are becoming extinct. However, we find no information about their replacement with new species. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 31: Some pollution problems have been correctly linked to industrialisation. Keywords for the question: some pollution problems, correctly linked, industrialisation, Lines 4-6 in paragraph no. 2 says, 7-9, “ . .. . And finally, most forms of environmental pollution either appear to have been exaggerated, or are transient – associated with the early phases of industrialisation and therefore best cured not by restricting economic growth, but by accelerating it. .. .. .” Here, most forms of environmental pollution = Some pollution problems, correctly linked = transient – associated, the early phases of industrialisation = industrialisation, So, the answer is: YES Question no. 32: It would be best to attempt to slow down economic growth. Keywords for the question: best to attempt, slow down, economic growth, In paragraph no. 5, take a look at the first few lines, “. .. . . Secondly, environmental groups need to be noticed by the mass media. They also need to keep the money rolling in. .. .. .” Here, keep the money rolling in = continue economic growth as it is, So, the answer is: NO Questions 33-37: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question no. 33: What aspect of scientific research does the writer express concern about in paragraph 4? Keywords for the question: aspect, scientific research, concern about, paragraph 4, The answer can be found in paragraph 4, “One is the lopsidedness built into scientific research. Scientific funding goes mainly to areas with many problems. That may be wise policy, but it will also create an impression that many more potential problems exist than is the case.” Here, lopsidedness = leaning on one side (selection of areas of research) So, the answer is: C (the selection of areas to research) Question no. 34: The writer quotes from the Worldwide Fund for Nature to illustrate how – Keywords for the question: writer, quotes, Worldwide Fund for Nature, illustrate, how, The writer says in paragraph no. 5, “ . .. . In 1997, for example, the World Wide Fund for Nature issued a press release entitled: ‘Two thirds of the world’s forests lost forever’. The truth turns out to be nearer 20%.” Here, Two thirds of the world’s forests = 66.66% of the world’s forests, This means the World Wide Fund for Nature exaggerates or overstresses their claims. So, the answer is: D (environmental groups can exaggerate their claims.) Question no. 35: What is the writer’s main point about lobby groups in paragraph 6? Keywords for the question: writer’s main point, lobby groups, paragraph 6, The writer says in paragraph no. 6, “. .. .. A trade organisation arguing for, say, weaker pollution controls is instantly seen as self-interested. Yet a green organisation opposing such a weakening is seen as altruistic, even if an impartial view of the controls in question might suggest they are doing more harm than good.” Here, the writer points out that some organisations get more criticism compared to some other. So, the answer is: C (Some receive more criticism than others.) Question no. 36: The writer suggests that newspapers print items that are intended to – Keywords for the question: newspapers, print, items, intended to, The answer can be found at the beginning of paragraph no. 7. The writer says here, “A third source of confusion is the attitude of the media. People are clearly more curious about bad news than good. Newspapers and broadcasters are there to provide what the public wants. .. ..” Here, to provide = to print items, what the public wants = meet their readers’ expectations, So, the answer is: B (meet their readers’ expectations.) Question no. 37: What does the writer say about America’s waste problem? Keywords for the question: America’s waste problem, The answer is found in paragraph no. 8 where the writer says, “ .. . People worry that the endless rise in the amount of stuff everyone throws away will cause the world to run out of places to dispose of waste. Yet, even if America’s trash output continues to rise as it has done in the past, and even if the American population doubles by 2100, all the rubbish America produces through the entire 21st century will still take up only one-12,000th of the area of the entire United States.” Here, the writer suggests that the trash problem in America is not as serious as it has been told. So, the answer is: B (It is not as important as we have been led to believe.) Questions 38-40: Completing summary with list of words [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete a summary with a list of words taken from the passage.

Keywords for the question: recent years, have been obliged to give up, lifestyle, but, continue to, depend mainly on, for food and clothes, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 2 in lines 10-13. The writer says here, “. . .. One form of pollution – the release of greenhouse gases that causes global warming – does appear to be a phenomenon that is going to extend well into our future, but its total impact is unlikely to pose a devastating problem. A bigger problem may well turn out to be an inappropriate response to it.” Here, a phenomenon that is going to extend well into our future = long-term phenomenon, A bigger problem may well turn out to be an inappropriate response to it = it will not have a catastrophic impact on our future, if we deal with it in the right way. So, the answers are: E (long-term) D (right) Question no. 40: If we try to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases, he believes that it would only have a minimal impact on rising temperatures. He feels it would be better to spend money on the more ___________ health problem of providing the world’s population with clean drinking water. Keywords for the question: produce, particularly expensive, In paragraph no. 11 the author says, “ . .. . Yet the cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, for the United States alone, will be higher than the cost of solving the world’s single, most pressing health problem: providing universal access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Such measures would avoid 2 million deaths every year, and prevent half a billion people from becoming seriously ill.” Here, reducing carbon dioxide emissions = reduce the levels of greenhouse gases, single most pressing health problem = urgent health problem, universal access to clean drinking water and sanitation = providing the world’s population with clean drinking water, So, the answer is: I (urgent)",

Keywords for the question: some plastics, behave, similar way, melt, under heat, can be moulded, new forms, The answer can be found in lines 4-5 paragraph no. 2, “ . .. . Some are ‘thermoplastic’, which means that, like candlewax, they melt when heated and can then be reshaped. … . .” Here, like = in a similar way, they melt when heated = they melt under heat, reshaped = moulded into new forms, So, the answer is: candlewax Question no. 2: Bakelite was unique because it was the first material to be both entirely ________ in origin, and thermosetting. Keywords for the question: Bakelite, unique, first material, both, entirely, in origin, thermosetting, The answer can be found in lines 5-7 in paragraph no. 2. The author says here, “Others are ‘thermosetting’: like eggs, they cannot revert to their original viscous state, and their shape is thus fixed for ever Bakelite had the distinction of being the first totally synthetic thermosetting plastic..” Here, distinction = unique, totally = entirely, So, the answer is: synthetic Question no. 3: There were several reasons for the research into plastics in the nineteenth century, among them the great advances that had been made in the field of _________ and the search for alternatives to natural resources like ivory. Keywords for the question: several reasons, research into plastics, nineteenth century, great advances, in the field of, search for alternatives, natural resources, ivory, Paragraph no. 3 gives us the answer to this question. The writer says here, “The history of today’s plastics begins with the discovery of a series of semi-synthetic thermoplastic materials in the mid-nineteenth century. The impetus behind the development of these early plastics was generated by a number of factors – immense technological progress in the domain of chemistry, coupled with wider cultural changes, and the pragmatic need to find acceptable substitutes for dwindling supplies of ‘luxury’ materials such as tortoiseshell and ivory.” Here, mid-nineteenth century = nineteenth century, immense technological progress = great advances, the domain of = the field of, acceptable substitutes = alternatives, So, the answer is: chemistry Questions 4-8: Completing FLOW-CHART with ONE WORD ONLY In this type of question, candidates are asked to write ONE WORD ONLY to complete some notes on the given flow-chart. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word.

Remember to focus on Proper nouns, random Capital letters, numbers, special characters of text etc.] N.B.: All the answers for this flow-chart can be found in paragraph no. 5 as this paragraph describes the ‘production of bakelite’. Question no. 4: stage one resin, called _________ Keywords for the question: phenol, formaldehyde, combine, vaccum, stage one resin, called, The answer can be found in lines 1-3 of paragraph no. 5. The writer says here, “The original patent outlined a three-stage process, in which phenol and formaldehyde (from wood or coal) were initially combined under vacuum inside a large egg-shaped kettle. The result was a resin known as Novalak, which became soluble and malleable when heated. .. ..” Here, The result was a resin = stage one resin, known as = called, So, the answer is: Novalak Question no. 5: __________ (e.g. cotton, asbestos) Keywords for the question: e.g. cotton, asbestos, catalysts, The answer can be found in lines 5-6 of paragraph no. 5. The author says here, “. . .. . Other substances were then introduced: including fillers, such as woodflour, asbestos or cotton, which increase strength and moisture resistance, catalysts .. .. .. ” Here, such as woodflour, asbestos or cotton = e.g. cotton, asbestos, So, the answer is: fillers Question no. 6: ___________ Keywords for the question: ammonia, formaldehyde, The answer can be found in line no. 8 of paragraph no. 5. The author states here, “. . .. . hexa, a compound of ammonia and formaldehyde which supplied the additional .. … .. ” So, the answer is: hexa Question no. 7: ________ Bakelite Keywords for the question: stage two resin, cool until hardened, break up, grind, powder, The answer can be found in lines 8-10 of paragraph no. 5. The author says here, “. . .. . supplied the additional formaldehyde necessary to form a thermosetting resin. This resin was then left to cool and harden, and ground up a second time. The resulting granular powder was raw Bakelite, … . .” Here, form a thermosetting resin = stage two resin, left to cool and harden = cool until hardened, ground up a second time = grind, resulting granular powder = powder, So, the answer is: raw Question no. 8: apply intense heat and _________ Keywords for the question: heat, pour into mould, apply, intense heat, The answer can be found in lines 11-13 of paragraph no. 5. The author says here, “. . .. . In the last stage, the heated Bakelite was poured into a hollow mould of the required shape and subjected to extreme heat and pressure, thereby ‘setting’ its form for life. .. .. .” Here, heated Bakelite was poured into a hollow mould = heat, pour into mould, subjected to = apply, extreme = intense, So, the answer is: pressure Question 9-10: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers for previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question no. 9 10: Which TWO of the following factors influencing the design of Bakelite objects are mentioned in the text? Keywords for the question: TWO, factors, influencing, design, Bakelite objects, If we look at paragraph no. 6, we can see that the writer says in lines 5-8, “. .. .. . Moulds had to be carefully designed so that the molten Bakelite would flow evenly and completely into the mould. Sharp corners proved impractical and were thus avoided, giving rise to the smooth, ‘streamlined’ style popular in the 1930s. … . .” Here, flow evenly and completely into the mould . .. . . giving rise to the smooth, ‘streamlined’ style = ease with which the resin could fill the mould, So, one of the answers is B (the ease with which the resin could fill the mould) Again, in lines 2-5 of the same paragraph, the writer says, “. . .. The object could not be designed so that it was locked into the mould and therefore difficult to extract. A common general rule was that objects should taper towards the deepest part of the mould, and if necessary the product was moulded in separate pieces. . .” Here, could not be designed so that it was locked into the mould and therefore difficult to extract = problem about removing the object, objects should taper towards the deepest part of the mould = facility with which the object could be removed from the mould, Therefore, another answer is C (the facility with which the object could be removed from the mould) So, the answers are: (in any order) B (the ease with which the resin could fill the mould) C (the facility with which the object could be removed from the mould) Questions 11-13: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 11: Modern-day plastic preparation is based on the same principles as that patented in 1907. Keywords for the question: modern-day plastic preparation, based on, same principles, patented, 1907, Take a look at the last lines of paragraph no. 4 where the author of the text writes, “ . .. On 13 July 1907, Baekeland took out his famous patent describing this preparation, the essential features of which are still in use today.” Here, essential features = principles, still in use today = modern-day plastic preparation, On 13 July 1907, Baekeland took out his famous patent = patented in 1907, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 12: Bakelite was immediately welcomed as a practical and versatile material. Keywords for the question: Bakelite, immediately welcomed, practical, versatile material, In paragraph no. 7, the writer says in the first line, “Baekeland’s invention, although treated with disdain in its early years, .. .. .” Here, treated with disdain = was not welcomed, its early years = immediately, So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 13: Bakelite was only available in a limited range of colours. Keywords for the question: Bakelite, only available, limited range of colours, Line no. 6 in paragraph no. 7 says, “. … and consumers everywhere relished its dazzling array of shades, . .. .” Here, dazzling array of shades = unlimited range of colours, So, the answer is: FALSE Reading Passage 2: Questions 14-27 The headline of the passage: What’s so funny? Questions 14-20: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 14: Arthur Koestler considered laughter biologically important in several ways. Keywords for the question: Arthur Koestler, laughter, biologically important, several ways, In paragraph no. 1 the author states in the last lines, “.. .. . The writer Arthur Koestler dubbed it the luxury reflex: ‘unique in that it serves no apparent biological purpose’.” Here, serves no apparent biological purpose = biologically not important at all, This means the question directly contradicts the text. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 15: Plato believed humour to be a sign of above-average intelligence. Keywords for the question: Plato, believed, humour, sign, above-average intelligence, In paragraph no. 2 the author states in lines 1-2, “ . .. . Plato expressed the idea that humour is simply a delighted feeling of superiority over others. .. .. .” Here, we do not find any comment made by Plato in relation to intelligence. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 16: Kant believed that a successful joke involves the controlled release of nervous energy. Keywords for the question: Kant, believed, successful joke, controlled release, nervous energy, The answer to this question can be found in lines 2-4 in paragraph no. 2, “ . .. Kant and Freud felt that joke-telling relies on building up a psychic tension which is safely punctured by the ludicrousness of the punch line. . .. .” Here, psychic tension = nervous energy, safely punctured = controlled release, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 17: Current thinking on humour has largely ignored Aristotle’s view on the subject. Keywords for the question: current thinking, humour, largely ignored, Aristotle’s view, Lines 4-6 in paragraph no. 2 gives us the answer to this question, “ .. . . But most modern humour theorists have settled on some version of Aristotle’s belief that jokes are based on a reaction to or resolution of incongruity, when the punchline is either a nonsense or, though appearing silly, has a clever second meaning.” Here, most modern humour theorists = current thinkers, have settled on = have agreed on, some version of Aristotle’s belief = some of Aristotle’s view, The lines suggest that current thinking on humour has agreed on some of Aristotle’s view on the subject. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 18: Graeme Ritchie’s work links jokes to artificial intelligence. Keywords for the question: Graeme Ritchie’s work, links, jokes, artificial intelligence, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 3. The author says here in lines 1-3, “Graeme Ritchie, a computational linguist in Edinburgh, studies the linguistic structure of jokes in order to understand not only humour but language understanding and reasoning in machines.. . .. .” Here, studies the linguistic structure of jokes = Graeme Ritchie’s work, in order to understand = links, language understanding and reasoning in machines = artificial intelligence, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 19: Most comedians use personal situations as a source of humour. Keywords for the question: most comedians, use, personal situations, as, source of humour, The last lines of paragraph no. 3 talks about what a comedian does when delivering a joke, “ .. .. . A comedian will present a situation followed by an unexpected interpretation that is also apt.” However, it doesn’t say anything about using personal situation as a source of humour. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 20: Chimpanzees make particular noises when they are playing. Keywords for the question: chimpanzees, particular noises, when, playing, In paragraph no.5 the author mentions the sound chimpanzees make in lines 4-5, “ . .. .. Chimpanzees have a ‘play-face’ – a gaping expression accompanied by a panting ‘ah, ah’ noise… .. .” Here, play-face = when they are playing, a panting ‘ah, ah’ noise = particular noises, So, the answer is: TRUE Questions 21-23: Labeling a diagram: [In this type of question, candidates are asked to label a diagram with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS from the passage. Keywords are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. However, we should not be surprised if the sequence is not maintained.

His scans showed that at the beginning of a joke the listener’s prefrontal cortex lit up, particularly the right prefrontal believed to be critical for problem solving.” Here, lit up = lights up, right prefrontal = right prefrontal cortex, believed to be critical for = linked to, So, the answer is: problem solving Question no. 22: _________ become active too Keywords for the question: become, active, too, Again, in paragraph no. 8, the writer says in lines 4-5, “ . .. But there was also activity in the temporal lobes at the side of the head .. .. .” Here, activity = become active, also = too, So, the answer is: temporal lobes Question no. 23: Orbital prefrontal cortex is activated – involved with ___________ Keywords for the question: Orbital prefrontal cortex, activated, involved with, Once again, in paragraph no. 8, the writer says in lines 6-8, “.. .. . Then when the punchline arrived, a new area sprang to life – the orbital prefrontal cortex. This patch of brain tucked behind the orbits of the eyes is associated with evaluating information.” Here, sprang to life = activated, associated with = involved with, So, the answer is: evaluating information Questions 24-27: Completing/Matching sentences with correct endings [For this type of question, candidates need to match the beginning and end of sentences. Candidates need to look for keywords in the sentence-beginnings and find the relative paragraphs and then sentences in the passage. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question no. 24: One of the brain’s most difficult tasks is to – Keywords for the question: one of, brain’s, most difficult tasks, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 9. In this paragraph, the writer says in lines 1-2, “Making a rapid emotional assessment of the events of the moment is an extremely demanding job for the brain, animal or human. .. .. .” Here, Making a rapid emotional assessment of the events of the moment = respond instantly to whatever in happening, extremely demanding job = one of the most difficult tasks, So, the answer is: C (respond instantly to whatever is happening.) Question no. 25: Because of the language they have developed, humans – Keywords for the question: because of, language, they, developed, humans, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 10. In this paragraph the author writes in lines 1-4, “ . .. All warm-blooded animals make constant tiny adjustments in arousal in response to external events, but humans, who have developed a much more complicated internal life as a result of language, respond emotionally not only to their surroundings, but to their own thoughts. .. .. .” Here, who have developed a much more complicated internal life as a result of language = because of the language they have developed, respond emotionally = react to, So, the answer is: A (react to their own thoughts.) Question no. 26: Individual responses to humour Keywords for the question: individual responses, humour, The last lines of paragraph no. 10 gives us the answer, “ . ..

Question no. 27: Peter Derks believes that humour – Keywords for the question: Peter Derks, believes, humour, The last paragraph says, “ .. . As Peter Derks, a psychologist at William and Mary College in Virginia, says: ‘I like to think of humour as the distorted mirror of the mind. It’s creative, perceptual, analytical and lingual. If we can figure out how the mind processes humour, then we’ll have a pretty good handle on how it works in general.” Here, the mind = the brain, we’ll have a pretty good handle on how it works in general = we may get valuable information about the operation of the brain, So, the answer is: D (may provide valuable information about the operation of the brain.) Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40 The headline of the passage: The Birth of Scientific English Questions 28-34: Summary completion [In this kind of questions candidates are given a summary for one, two, or three paragraphs with some fill-in-the-blanks questions. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords from the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers to fill in the gaps.] Question no. 28: In Europe, modem science emerged at the same time as the nation state. At first, the scientific language of choice remained _________. Keywords for the question: Europe, modern science, emerged, same time, nation state, at first, scientific language of choice, remained, The final lines of the first paragraph have the answer to this question. Here, the writer of the passage says in lines 12-18, “ . . .. .. Given the prominence of scientific English today, it may seem surprising that no one really knew how to write science in English before the 17th century. Before that, Latin was regarded as the lingua franca1 for European intellectuals.” Here, no one really knew how to write science in English before the 17th century = modem science emerged at the same time as the nation state, Before that = At first, lingua franca1= scientific language of choice, (here, the number 1 with lingua franca means there’s a footnote at the end of the page to explain the phrase) So, the answer is: Latin Question no. 29: It allowed scientists to communicate with other socially privileged thinkers while protecting their work from unwanted exploitation. Sometimes the desire to protect ideas seems to have been stronger than the desire to communicate them, particularly in the case of mathematicians and __________. Keywords for the question: allowed scientists, communicate, other socially privileged thinkers, protecting, work, unwanted exploitation, desire, protect ideas, seems to have been stronger, than, desire to communicate them, particularly, mathematicians, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 6 where the author says, “A second reason for writing in Latin may, perversely, have been a concern for secrecy. Open publication had dangers in putting into the public domain preliminary ideas which had not yet been fully exploited by their ‘author’. This growing concern about intellectual property rights was a feature of the period – it reflected both the humanist notion of the individual, rational scientist who invents and discovers through private intellectual labour, and the growing connection between original science and commercial exploitation. There was something of a social distinction between ‘scholars and gentlemen’ who understood Latin, and men of trade who lacked a classical education. And in the mid-17th century it was common practice for mathematicians to keep their discoveries and proofs secret, by writing them in cipher, in obscure languages, or in private messages deposited in a sealed box with the Royal Society. Some scientists might have felt more comfortable with Latin precisely because its audience, though in national, was socially restricted. Doctors clung the most keenly to Latin as an ‘insider language’.” Here, keep their discoveries and proofs secret = the desire to protect ideas, So, the answer is: doctors Questions no. 30 31: In Britain, moreover, scientists worried that English had neither the 30. ____________ nor the 31. ____________ to express their ideas. Keywords for the question: thinking, numbers, concepts, separate from, physical objects, The answers to these questions are in paragraph no.7. Let’s have a look, “A third reason why the writing of original science in English was delayed may have been to do with the linguistic inadequacy of English in the early modern period. English was not well equipped to deal with the scientific argument. First, it lacked the necessary technical vocabulary. Second, it lacked the grammatical resources required to represent the world in an objective and impersonal way, and to discuss the relations, such as cause and effect, that might hold between complex and hypothetical entities.” Here, First, it lacked Second, it lacked = English had neither . .. .. nor . ….. , So, the answers are: (in any order) technical vocabulary grammatical resources Question no. 32: This situation only changed after 1660 when scientists associated with the _____________ set about developing English. Keywords for the question: earliest tribes, sufficiency, more important, than, quantity, Let’s have a look at paragraph no. 8. Here, the writer says in the first few lines, “Fortunately, several members of the Royal Society possessed an interest in language and became engaged in various linguistic projects. Although a proposal in 1664 to establish a committee for improving the English language came to little, the society’s members did a great deal to foster the publication of science in English and to encourage the development of a suitable writing style. Many members of the Royal Society also published monographs in English. . . .. .” Here, in 1664 = after 1600, improving the English language = developing English, So, the answer is: Royal Society Questions no. 33 34: An early scientific journal fostered a new kind of writing based on short descriptions of specific experiments. Although English was then overtaken by 33. ___________, it developed again in the 19th century as a direct result of the 34. ____________. Keywords for the question: Indigenous Tasmanians, used, only four terms, indicate, numbers of objects, The answer can be traced in the final paragraph as the writer explains here, “The 17th century was thus a formative period in the establishment of scientific English. In the following century, much of this momentum was lost as German established itself as the leading European language of science. It is estimated that by the end of the 18th century 401 German scientific journals had been established as opposed to 96 in France and 50 in England. However, in the 19th century, scientific English again enjoyed substantial lexical growth as the industrial revolution created the need for new technical vocabulary, and new, specialised, professional societies were instituted to promote and publish in the new disciplines.” Here, much of this momentum was lost .. . .. . German established itself as the leading European language of science = English was overtaken by German, scientific English again enjoyed substantial lexical growth = it developed again, So, the answers are: German industrial revolution Questions 35-37: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 35: There was strong competition between scientists in Renaissance Europe. Keywords for the question: strong competition, scientists, Renaissance Europe, In the second paragraph, we find information about Renaissance in Europe and competition, “The European Renaissance (c. 14th-16th century) is sometimes called the ‘revival of learning’, a time of renewed interest in the ‘lost knowledge’ of classical times. At the same time, however, scholars also began to test and extend this knowledge. The emergent nation states of Europe developed competitive interests in world exploration and the development of trade. . .. .. “ Here, we find information about competitive interest in world exploration. However, there is NO INFORMATION about strong competition between scientists. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 36: The most important scientific development of the Renaissance period was the discovery of magnetism. Keywords for the question: most important scientific development, Renaissance period, discovery of magnetism, The answer can be found at the later part of paragraph no. 2 where the writer says, “ . .. .. . Such expansion, which was to take the English language west to America and east to India, was supported by scientific developments such as the discovery of magnetism (and hence the invention of the compass), improvements in cartography and – perhaps the most important scientific revolution of them all – the new theories of astronomy and the movement of the Earth in relation to the planets and stars, developed by Copernicus (1473-1543).” Here, perhaps the most important scientific revolution of them all = The most important scientific development of the Renaissance period, So, the most important scientific development of the Renaissance period was the new theories of astronomy and the movement of the Earth in relation to the planets and stars; NOT the discovery of magnetism. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 37: In 17th-century Britain, leading thinkers combined their interest in science with an interest in how to express ideas. Keywords for the question: 17th century Britain, leading thinkers, combined, interest, science, an interest, how to express ideas, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 10 and at the beginning of the final paragraph. So, our answer should be here. Let’s have a look. “In 1665 a new scientific journal, Philosophical Transactions, was inaugurated. Perhaps the first international English-language scientific journal, it encouraged a new genre of scientific writing, that of short, focused accounts of particular experiments. The 17th century was thus a formative period in the establishment of scientific English. ….. …” Here, it encouraged a new genre of scientific writing, that of short, focused accounts of particular experiments = leading thinkers combined their interests in science by writing in the new scientific journal (an interest in how to express ideas). So, the answer is: TRUE Questions 38-40: Completing table: with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS [In this type of questions candidates need to fill in the gaps in a table with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Science written in the first half of the 17th century Language used Latin English Type of science Original 38 _____________ Examples 39 _____________ Encyclopaedias Target audience International scholars 40 ____________, but socially wider Question no. 38: Keywords for the question: English, type of science, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 4. The writer says here, “Across Europe similar academies and societies arose, creating new national traditions of science. In the initial stages of the scientific revolution, most publications in the national languages were popular works, encyclopaedias, educational textbooks and translations. Original science was not done in English until the second half of the 17th century. Here, national languages = English, These lines suggest that although Original science used Latin in the first half of the 17th Century, popular science works were published in English. Original science used English in the second half of the 17th Century. So, the answer is: popular Question no. 39: Keywords for the question: Latin, original, examples, At the end of paragraph no. 4, the writer says, “ . ……. .. For example, Newton published his mathematical treatise, known as the Principia, in Latin, but published his later work on the properties of light – Opticks – in English.” Here, For example = examples, his mathematical treatise = original work, So, the answer is: Principia/ the Principia/ Newton’s Principia/ mathematical treatise Question no. 40: Keywords for the question: English, Encyclopedias, target audience, socially wider, In paragraph no. 5, the author mentions, “ . .. . Latin was suitable for an international audience of scholars, whereas English reached a socially wider, but more local, audience. Hence, popular science was written in English.” So, the answer is: local/ more local/ local audience",

Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question no. 1: details of the range of family types involved in an education programme Keywords for the question: range of family types, involved in, education programme, In section D, we find two paragraphs. At the end of the first paragraph, in lines 11-17, the author says, “ .. . . The four-year pilot study included 380 families who were about to have their first child and who represented a cross-section of socio-economic status, age and family configurations. They included single-parent and two-parent families, families in which both parents worked, and families with either the mother or father at home.” Here, single-parent and two-parent families, families in which both parents worked, and families with either the mother or father at home = details of the range of family types, So, the answer is: D Question no. 2: reasons why a child’s early years are so important Keywords for the question: reason, why, child’s early years, so important, Both the paragraphs in section B provide details about the importance of the early years of a child. In the first paragraph, the writer says, “ … .. by the age of three, most children have the potential to understand about 1000 words .. .. .” Then, in the second paragraph, the writer says again, “. .. . research has shown that while every child is born with a natural curiosity, it can be suppressed dramatically during the second and third years of life. Researchers claim that the human personality is formed during the first two years of life, and during the first three years children learn the basic skills they will use in all their later learning both at home and at school.” So, the answer is: B Question no. 3: reasons why an education programme failed Keywords for the question: reasons, why, education programme, failed, Section C contains two paragraphs. In the first paragraph, the writer talks about the ‘Headstart’ education programme. Then, in the second paragraph, the writer says at the beginning, “Despite substantial funding, results have been disappointing.” Here, results have been disappointing = the education programme failed, So, the answer is: C Question no. 4: a description of the positive outcomes of an education programme Keywords for the question: description, positive outcomes, education programme, In section E, the author of the passage says in the beginning, in lines 1-7, “At the age of three, the children who had been involved in the ‘Missouri’ programme were evaluated alongside a cross-section of children selected from the same range of socio-economic backgrounds and family situations, and also a random sample of children that age. The results were phenomenal.” Here, the results were phenomenal = positive outcomes, Then, in the following lines, the writer provides a detailed description of the positive outcomes. So, the answer is: E Question 6-9: Classifying groups [This type of question asks candidates to classify information from the given reading text. Candidates are given some groups from the text, and a list of options, which are listed as A, B, C etc. They must match the correct groups with the correct options. N.B.: This question doesn’t follow any sequence. So, they should be answered after all other questions in the passage.] Question no. 5: was administered to a variety of poor and wealthy families Keywords for the question: administered to, variety of, poor and wealthy families, In section E, the author says about the ‘Missouri’ programme in lines 4-5 of the first paragraph, “ .. .. a cross-section of children selected from the same range of socio-economic backgrounds and family situations .. .” Then, in the second paragraph, the writer says in the last lines, “ .. . . That interaction was not necessarily bad in poorer families.” Moreover, in section D, take a look at these lines in the first paragraph, “ . .. . The ‘Missouri’ programme was predicated on research showing that .. … . The four-year pilot study included 380 families who were about to have their first child and who represented a cross-section of socio-economic status, age and family configurations. . .. . ” Here, a cross-section of socio-economic status = both poor and wealthy families, This means the ‘Missouri’ programme was administered to a variety of poor and wealthy families. So, the answer is: B (the ‘Missouri’ programme) Question no. 6: continued with follow-up assistance in elementary schools Keywords for the question: continued with, follow-up assistance, elementary schools, We can learn from the passage that both the ‘Headstart’ and ‘Missouri’ programmes aimed at children’s early education before the age of three. So, logically, neither the ‘Headstart’ nor the ‘Missouri’ programme continued with further assistance in elementary schools. So, the answer is: D (neither the ‘Missouri’ nor the ‘Headstart’ programme) Question no. 7: did not succeed in its aim Keywords for the question: did not succeed, its aim, Section C contains two paragraphs. In the first paragraph, the writer talks about the ‘Headstart’ programme. Then, in the second paragraph, the writer says at the beginning, “Despite substantial funding, results have been disappointing.” Here, results have been disappointing = the education programme failed or did not succeed in its aim, So, the answer is: A (the ‘Headstart’ programme) Question no. 8: supplied many forms of support and training to parents Keywords for the question: supplied, many forms of, support and training, parents, The writer gives details about the ‘Missouri’ programme in section D, “ . . . a pilot programme was launched in Missouri in the US that focused on parents as the child’s first teachers… .. The programme involved trained parent-educators visiting the parent’s home and working with the parent, or parents, and the child. Information on child development, and guidance on things to look for and expect as the child grows were provided, plus guidance in fostering the child’s intellectual, language, social and motor-skill development.” Here, Information on child development, and guidance on things to look for and expect as the child grows were provided, plus guidance in fostering the child’s intellectual, language, social and motor-skill development = the many forms of support and training supplied to parents, So, the answer is: B (the ‘Missouri’ programme) Question no. 9: received insufficient funding Keywords for the question: received, insufficient funding, In section C, we find about the sufficient funding for the ‘Headstart’ programme, “Despite substantial funding, results have been disappointing. . ..” So, the ‘Headstart’ programme received substantial or sufficient funding. Then, in section D, in the second paragraph, the writer provides a detailed description of guidance and support provided to parents and children by the ‘Missouri’ programme. This means the programme received more than sufficient funding. So, the answer is: D (neither the ‘Missouri’ nor the ‘Headstart’ programme) Question no. 10: was designed to improve pre-schoolers’ educational development Keywords for the question: was designed, improve, pre-schoolers’ educational development, In section D, the author of the passage says that the ‘Missouri’ programme “ .. . . included 380 families who were about to have their first child . .. .”. Moreover, this programme lasted in 4 years. In these 4 years, the programme provided training and support to the parents and medical check-ups for the children. So, this is understood that this programme was designed to improve the pre-schooler’s (first child) educational development. Moreover, in section C, the writer says that ‘Headstart’ programme “ . .. . took children into pre-school institutions at the age of three and was supposed to help the children of poorer families succeed in school.” Therefore, we can realize that both the programmes were designed to improve pre-scholers’ educational development. So, the answer is: C (both the ‘Missouri’ and the ‘Headstart’ programme) Questions 11-13: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 11: Most ‘Missouri’ programme three-year-olds scored highly in areas such as listening, speaking, reasoning and interacting with others. Keywords for the question: most ‘Missouri’ programme, three-year-old, scored, highly, areas, such as, listening, speaking, reasoning, interacting with others, The first paragraph in section E provides us with the answer to this question. The writer presents the phenomenal results of the ‘Missouri’ programme here, “ . . . The results were phenomenal. By the age of three, the children in the programme were significantly more advanced in language development than their peers, had made greater strides in problem solving and other intellectual skills, and were further along in social development, in fact, the average child on the programme was performing at the level of the top 15 to 20 per cent of their peers in such things as auditory comprehension, verbal ability and language ability.” Here, auditory comprehension = listening, verbal ability = speaking, problem solving = reasoning, social development = interacting with others, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 12: ‘Missouri’ programme children of young, uneducated, single parents scored less highly on the tests. Keywords for the question: ‘Missouri’ programme children, young, uneducated, single parents, scored, less highly, tests, In the second paragraph of section E, the writer says, “ . . .. Most important of all, the traditional measures of ‘risk’, such as parents’ age and education, or whether they were a single parent, bore little or no relationship to the measures of achievement and language development. Children in the programme performed equally well regardless of socio-economic disadvantages. . ..” Here, performed equally well regardless of socio-economic disadvantages = scored equal, not less highly, So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 13: The richer families in the ‘Missouri’ programme had higher stress levels. Keywords for the question: richer families, ‘Missouri’ programme, had, higher stress levels, The explanation regarding the ‘Missouri’ programme was given in section D and E. However, there was no mention of stress levels in the richer families here. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Reading Passage 2: Questions 14-26 The headline of the passage: Disappearing Delta Questions 14-17: List of headings [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph that will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question no. 14: Paragraph B The first part of paragraph B guides us to the answer to this question. The writer says here, “Up to now, people have blamed this loss of delta land on the two large dams at Aswan in the south of Egypt, which hold back virtually all of the sediment that used to flow down the river. Before the dams were built, the Nile flowed freely, . .. . .” Here, the highlighted points suggest that the two large dams built in Aswan have interrupted the natural flow of sediment in the river Nile. So, the answer is: iv (Interrupting a natural process) Question no. 15: Paragraph D Paragraph D explains the effects of irrigation in the river Nile on sedimentation as the writer says here, “Once north of Cairo, most of the Nile water is diverted into more than 10,000 kilometres of irrigation canals . . .. . The water in the irrigation canals is still or very slow-moving and thus cannot carry sediment’, Stanley explains. The sediment sinks to the bottom of the canals and then is added to fields by farmers or pumped with the water into the four large freshwater lagoons that are located near the outer edges of the delta. .. ..” So, the answer is: i (Effects of irrigation on sedimentation) Question no. 16: Paragraph E Paragraph E explains how pollutants found in the river water are becoming a threat to food production. The writer says here, “ .. . . by the time the sediment has come to rest in the fields and lagoons, it is laden with municipal, industrial and agricultural waste from the Cairo region, which is home to more than 40 million people. ‘Pollutants are building up faster and faster,’ says Stanley.” Again, take a look at these lines from the same paragraph, “ . .. . Since that time the concentration of mercury has increased significantly. Lead from engines that use leaded fuels and from other industrial sources has also increased dramatically. These poisons can easily enter the food chain, affecting the productivity of fishing and farming. .. .” Here, productivity of fishing and farming = food production, So, the answer is: v (The threat of food production) Question no. 17: Paragraph F The last few lines of paragraph F indicate the answer. The writer says here, “ .. . .. He says, however, that in the long term an alternative process such as desalination may have to be used to increase the amount of water available. ‘In my view, Egypt must devise a way to have more water running through the river and the delta,’ says Stanley. Easier said than done in a desert region with a rapidly growing population.” Here, Easier said than done = the solutions may take quite a long time and efforts, So, the answer is: viii (Looking at the long-term impact) Questions 19-24: YES, NO, NOT GIVEN: [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 18: Coastal erosion occurred along Egypt’s Mediterranean coast before the building of the Aswan dams. Keywords for the question: coastal erosion, occurred, Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, before, building, Aswan dams, The answer can is found in the last few lines of paragraph A, “ . .. In the past, land scoured away from the coastline by the currents of the Mediterranean Sea used to be replaced by sediment brought down to the delta by the River Nile, but this is no longer happening.” Here, land scoured away from the coastline = coastal erosion occurred, So, the answer is: YES Question no. 19: Some people predicted that the Aswan dams would cause land loss before they were built. Keywords for the question: some people, predicted, Aswan dams, would cause, land loss, before, built, The first lines of paragraph B may confuse you here, as the writer says here, “Up to now, people have blamed this loss of delta land on the two large dams at Aswan in the south of Egypt, .. ..” We should understand here, the lines suggest that people now blame the Aswan dams for the land loss. However, the question asks us whether people predicted it before the construction of Aswan dams. We don’t find any such information here. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 20: The Aswan dams were built to increase the fertility of the Nile delta. Keywords for the question: Aswan dams, built, to increase, fertility, Nile delta, The reasons for building Aswan dams are provided in lines 15-19 of paragraph B, “ . .. . . the Aswan dams were constructed in the 20th century to provide electricity and irrigation, and to protect the huge population centre of Cairo and its surrounding areas from annual flooding and drought, . .. .” These lines suggest that the Aswan dams were not built to improve the fertility of the Nile delta. So, the answer is: NO Question no. 21: Stanley found that the levels of sediment in the river water in Cairo were relatively high. Keywords for the question: Stanley, found, levels of sediments, river water, Cairo, relatively high, Take a close look at the last few lines of paragraph C where Stanley compares the level of sediment in the Nile delta in Cairo and the Mediterranean, “ . .. ‘There is still a lot of sediment coming into the delta, but virtually no sediment comes out into the Mediterranean to replenish the coastline. So this sediment must be trapped on the delta itself.” Here, the delta = the Nile delta in Cairo, a lot of sediment = relatively high level of sediment, So, the answer is: YES Question no. 22: Sediment in the irrigation canals on the Nile delta causes flooding. Keywords for the question: sediment, irrigation canals, Nile delta, causes, flooding, Paragraph D talks about the impact of irrigation on sedimentation in the delta and paragraph E deals with the threats of pollutants in food production. No cause of flooding is found here. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 23: Water is pumped from the irrigation canals into the lagoons. Keywords for the question: water, pumped, irrigation canals, into, lagoons, The answer can be found in paragraph D, in lines 7-11, “ . .. . The sediment sinks to the bottom of the canals and then is added to fields by farmers or pumped with the water into the four large freshwater lagoons that are located near the outer edges of the delta. .. .. .” The lines suggest that water is pumped from the irrigation canals into the four lagoons. So, the answer is: YES Questions 24-26: Completing summary with a list of words [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete a summary with a list of words taken from the passage. Candidates must write the correct letter (not the words) as the answers. Keywords and synonyms are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Question no. 24: In addition to the problem of coastal erosion, there has been a marked increase in the level of _________ contained in the silt deposited in the Nile delta. Keywords for the question: in addition to, problem, coastal erosion, marked increase, level of, silt, deposited, Nile delta, The point of coastal erosion is discussed in paragraph A and B. Then, paragraph C and D mainly discusses the point of sedimentation process. After that, in paragraph E, the writer talks in details about the problem created by waste and pollutants, “ . . . But by the time the sediment has come to rest in the fields and lagoons it is laden with municipal, industrial and agricultural waste from the Cairo region, which is home to more than 40 million people. ‘Pollutants are building up faster and faster,’ says Stanley. Here, building up faster and faster = marked increase, So, the answer is: F (pollutants) Questions no. 25 26: To deal with this, Stanley suggests the use of 25. _________ in the short term, and increasing the amount of water available through 26. ________ in the longer term. Keywords for the question: deal with, Stanley suggests, use of, short term, increasing, amount of water, available through, longer term, In paragraph F, we find the short-term and long-term solutions to the problem. In lines 9-11, the writer states, “ . .. . In the immediate future, Stanley believes that one solution would be to make artificial floods to flush out the delta waterways, in the same way that natural floods did before the construction of the dams. .. ..” Here, In the immediate future = short-term solution, Then, right after that, the writer says again, “ . .. He says, however, that in the long term an alternative process such as desalination may have to be used to increase the amount of water available. .. ..” Here, in the long term = long-term solution, So, the answers are: A (artificial floods) B (desalination) Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40 The headline of the passage: The Return of Artificial Intelligence Questions 27-31: Identifying information: [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here. Please, do not read the questions first.] Question no. 27: how AI might have a military impact Keywords for the question: AI, military impact, The answer lies in the middle of paragraph E, in lines 3-4, “ . .. HNC claim that their system, based on a cluster of 30 processors, could be used to spot camouflaged vehicles on a battlefield . . ..” Here, spot camouflaged vehicles on a battlefield = might have a military impact, So, the answer is: E Question no. 28: the fact that AI brings together a range of separate research areas Keywords for the question: AI, brings together, a range of, separate, research areas, Lines 3-5 in paragraph B gives us the answer to this question, “ . .. . The expression provided an attractive but informative name for a research programme that encompassed such previously disparate fields as operations research, cybernetics, logic and computer science. …” Here, encompassed = linked/included, operations research, cybernetics, logic and computer science = a range of separate research areas, So, the answer is: B Question no. 29: the reason why AI has become a common topic of conversation again Keywords for the question: reason, why, AI, become, common topic of conversation, again, In paragraph a, take a look at the first few lines, “After years in the wilderness, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ (AI) seems poised to make a comeback. AI was big in the 1980s but vanished in the 1990s. It re-entered public consciousness with the release of AI, a movie about a robot boy. This has ignited public debate about AI, . .. .” Here, make a comeback = has become . .. . . again, re-entered public consciousness = has become a common topic of conversation again, So, the answer is: A Question no. 30: how AI could help deal with difficulties related to the amount of information available electronically Keywords for the question: how, AI, could help, deal with, difficulties, amount of information, available, electronically, Paragraph F talks about new companies who may deal with humongous amount of information using AI in the coming future, “Another factor that may boost the prospects for AI in the near future is that investors are now looking for firms using clever technology, rather than just a clever business model, to differentiate themselves. In particular, the problem of information overload, exacerbated by the growth of e-mail and the explosion in the number of web pages, means there are plenty of opportunities for new technologies to help filter and categorise information – classic AI problems. . .. .” Here, the problem of information overload = difficulties related to the amount of information available electronically, So, the answer is: F Question no. 31: where the expression AI was first used Keywords for the question: where, expression AI, first used, Take a close look at the first lines of paragraph B, “The field was launched, and the term ‘artificial intelligence’ coined at a conference in 1956 by a group of researchers that included Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, Herbert Simon and Alan Newell, all of whom went on to become leading figures in the field.. . .” Here, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ coined = expression AI was first used, So, the answer is: B Questions 32-37: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 32: The researchers who launched the field of AI had worked together on other projects in the past. Keywords for the question: researchers, launched, field of AI, worked together, other projects, in the past, In paragraph B, the first lines talk about the researchers who launched the field of AI, “The field was launched, and the term ‘artificial intelligence’ coined at a conference in 1956 by a group of researchers that included Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, Herbert Simon and Alan Newell, all of whom went on to become leading figures in the field. . .. .” However, whether they worked together in any other projects in the past was not mentioned. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 33: In 1985, AI was at its lowest point. Keywords for the question: 1985, AI, lowest point, In paragraph C, the first line says, “ . .. . Most researchers agree that AI peaked around 1985. ..” Here, peaked around 1985 = was at its highest point, So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 34: Research into agent technology was more costly than research into neural networks. Keywords for the question: research, agent technology, more costly, research, neural networks, We find the mention of agent technology and neural networks in the last lines of paragraph C, “ . .. By the late 1980s, the term AI was being avoided by many researchers, who opted instead to align themselves with specific sub-disciplines such as neural networks, agent technology, case-based reasoning, and so on.” However, no comparison has been made here between neural networks and agent technology. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 35: Applications of AI have already had a degree of success. Keywords for the question: applications of AI, already had, a degree of success, In paragraph D, the first indicates the answer, “Ironically, in some ways AI was a victim of its own success. .. ..” The sentence suggests that AI has been successful in some cases and its own success led to some problems. Here, in some ways = a degree of, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 36: The problems waiting to be solved by AI have not changed since 1967. Keywords for the question: the problems, waiting to be solved, AI, not changed, since 1967, For this question, we have to look at both paragraphs C and D. First, in paragraph C, the author of the passage says in lines 3-5, “ .. .. Marvin Minsky said in 1967 that within a generation the problem of creating ‘artificial intelligence’ would be substantially solved. . .. .” Then, in line no. 6, the author says, “ . .. It proved to be a false dawn. .. .” This means AI could not solve the problem and as a result, “ . .. . By the late 1980, the term AI was being avoided by many researchers, who opted instead to align themselves with specific sub-disciplines such as neural networks, agent technology, case-based reasoning, and so on.” After that, in paragraph D, the author says in lines 6-8, “ . .. Meanwhile, the technologies that made it onto the market, such as speech recognition, language translation and decision-support software, were no longer regarded as AI. Yet all three once fell well within the umbrella of AI research.” So, the problems (that AI was meant to solve) were no longer considered as AI problems. Therefore, the problems waiting to be solved by AI have changed since 1967. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 37: The film 2001: A Space Odyssey reflected contemporary ideas about the potential of AI computers. Keywords for the question: film 2001: A Space Odyssey, reflected, contemporary ideas, potential of AI computers, To find the answer to this question, let’s go to paragraph G, where the author mentions the name of the movie, “The 1969 film, 2001: A space Odyssey, featured an intelligent computer called HAL 9000. As well as understanding and speaking English, HAL could play chess and even learned to lipread. HAL thus encapsulated the optimism of the 1960s that intelligent computers would be widespread by 2001. . .. ” Here, encapsulated the optimism of the 1960s = reflected contemporary ideas, So, the answer is: TRUE Questions 38-40: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question no. 38: According to researchers, in the late 1980s there was a feeling that – Keywords for the question: according to researchers, late 1980s, a feeling, The answer can be found in paragraph C in lines 7-11. The author says here, “. . .. ‘There was undue optimism in the early 1980s.’ says David Leake, a researcher at Indiana University. ‘Then when people realised there were hard problems, there was retrenchment. By the late 1980s, the term AI was being avoided by many researchers, who opted instead to align themselves with specific sub-disciplines such as neural networks, agent technology, case-based reasoning, and so on.’” Here, undue = overstressed/ too much (so the expectation was too much), people realised there were hard problems, there was retrenchment = original expectations of AI may not have been justified, (and so, the funding for AI research became poor), So, the answer is: B (original expectations of AI may not have been justified) Question no. 39: In Dr Leake’s opinion, the reputation of AI suffered as a result of – Keywords for the question: Dr. Leake’s opinion, reputation, suffered, as a result of, Again, take a look at lines 8-11 in paragraph C, where we find the opinion of Dr. Leake, “‘Then when people realised there were hard problems, there was retrenchment. By the late 1980s, the term AI was being avoided by many researchers, who opted instead to align themselves with specific sub-disciplines such as neural networks, agent technology, case-based reasoning, and so on.’” Here, people realised there were hard problems, = people’s perception about AI changed, retrenchment / AI was being avoided= the reputation of AI suffered, So, the answer is: A (changing perceptions) Question no. 40: The prospects for AI may benefit from– Keywords for the question: prospects for AI, may, benefit from, The answer can be found in paragraph F, in lines 1-3, “Another factor that may boost prospects for AI in the near future is that investors are looking for firms using clever technology, rather than just a clever business model, to differentiate thems",

A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph that will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question no. 1: Section A Section A contains two paragraphs. In the first paragraph, take a look at line no. 7, “ . .. these regions are fragile (i.e. highly vulnerable to abnormal pressures). . .” Then, in the second paragraph, the author of the passage says, “Tourists are drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the unique cultures of their indigenous people. And poor governments in these isolated areas have welcomed the new breed of ‘adventure tourist’, grateful for the hard currency they bring. For several years now, tourism has been the prime source of foreign exchange in Nepal and Bhutan. Tourism is also a key element in the economies of Arctic zones such as Lapland and Alaska and in desert areas such as Ayers Rock in Australia and Arizona’s Monument Valley.” Here, Tourists are drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the unique cultures of their indigenous people, poor governments in these isolated areas have welcomed the new breed of ‘adventure tourist’, grateful for the hard currency they bring = the reason for the expansion of tourism there, So, the answer is: iii (Fragile regions and the reasons for the expansion of tourism there) Question no. 2: Section B Section B explains how wilderness tourism has negatively affected areas such as mountains, deserts and arctic regions. Look at these lines from the first paragraph, “ .. .. When hill-farmers, for example, can make more money in a few weeks working as porters for foreign trekkers than they can in a year working in their fields, . .. .. .. . In some hill-regions, this has led to a serious decline in farm output and a change in the local diet, because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and irrigation systems and tend to crops. The result has been that many people in these regions have turned to outside supplies of rice and other foods.” Then, in the second paragraph, the writer talks about the effects in the Arctic region, “ .. . However, as some inhabitants become involved in tourism, they no longer have time to collect wild food; this has led to increasing dependence on bought food and stores. … . .” So, the answer is: v (Some of the disruptive effects of wilderness tourism) Question no. 3: Section C In section C, the first few lines of the second paragraph indicate the answer to this question, “In the Swiss Alps, communities have decided that their future depends on integrating tourism more effectively with the local economy. .. ..” Here, integrating tourism more effectively with the local economy = How local communities can balance their own needs with the demands of wilderness tourism, Also, in the third paragraph, in lines 3-4, the writer talks more about the integration, “ . . . But some Arctic communities are now operating tour businesses themselves, thereby ensuring that the benefits accrue locally. … ..” Here, Arctic communities are now operating tour businesses themselves = How local communities can balance their own needs with the demands of wilderness tourism, So, the answer is: ii (How local communities can balance their own needs with the demands of wilderness tourism) Question 4-9: YES, NO, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 4: The low financial cost of selling up wilderness tourism makes it attractive to many countries. Keywords for the question: low financial cost, selling up, wilderness tourism, makes, attractive, many countries, The answer lies in section A, in beginning of the first paragraph, “ .. . . Countries all across the world are actively promoting their ‘wilderness’ regions – such as mountains. Arctic lands, deserts, small islands and wetlands – to high-spending tourists. The attraction of these areas is obvious: by definition, wilderness tourism requires little or no initial investment. . …” Here, wilderness tourism requires little or no initial investment = low financial cost of selling up wilderness tourism, So, the answer is: YES Question no. 5: Deserts, mountains and Arctic regions are examples of environments that are both ecologically and culturally fragile. Keywords for the question: Deserts, mountains and Arctic regions, examples of environments, The answer is in the first paragraph of section A in lines 7-8, “ .. .. these regions are fragile (i.e. highly vulnerable to abnormal pressures) not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms of the culture of their inhabitants. . ..” Here, not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms of the culture of their inhabitants = both ecologically and culturally, So, the answer is: YES Question no. 6: Wilderness tourism operates throughout the year in fragile areas. Keywords for the question: wilderness tourism, operates, throughout the year, fragile areas, The last lines of paragraph no. 1 in section A gives us the answer, “ . .. . Consequently, most human activities, including tourism, are limited to quite clearly defined parts of the year.” Here, limited to quite clearly defined parts of the year = tourism does not operate throughout the year in fragile areas, So, the answer is: NO Question no. 7: The spread of tourism in certain hill-regions has resulted in a fall in the amount of food produced locally. Keywords for the question: spread of tourism, certain hill-regions, resulted, fall in the amount of food, produced locally, In section B, lines 2-8 of the first paragraph says, “. . .. When hill-farmers, for example, can make more money in a few weeks working as porters for foreign trekkers than they can in a year working in their fields, it is not surprising that many of them give up their farm-work, which is thus left to other members of the family. In some hill-regions, this has led to a serious decline in farm output and a change in the local diet, because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and irrigation systems and tend to crops. .. ..” Here, the lines suggest that many farming communities have left their jobs of farming as they can earn more money by selling pottery to the travellers due to the spread of tourism. This has resulted in a serious decline in farm output (resulted in a fall in the amount of food produced locally). So, the answer is: YES Question no. 8: Traditional food-gathering in desert societies was distributed evenly over the year. Keywords for the question: traditional food-gathering, desert societies, distributed evenly, over the year, In section B, in the second paragraph, take a look at the first few lines, “In Arctic and desert societies, year-round survival has traditionally depended on hunting animals and fish and collecting fruit over a relatively short season. . .. .” Here, hunting animals and fish and collecting fruit = traditional food-gathering, over a relatively short season = NOT distributed evenly over the year, So, the answer is: NO Question no. 9: Government handouts do more damage than tourism does to traditional patterns of food-gathering. Keywords for the question: government handouts, do more damage, than, tourism does, traditional patterns, food-gathering, We find the mention of ‘government handouts’ in line no. 6 in the second paragraph of section B. However, we find NO COMPARISON on whether ‘government handouts’ do more damage to traditional patterns of food-gathering than tourism does. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 10-13: Completing table: ONE WORD ONLY [In this type of question, candidates need to fill in the gaps in a table with ONE WORD ONLY. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Title of the table: The positive ways in which some local communities have responded to tourism Question no. 10: People/Location: Swiss Pays d’Enhaut Activity: Revived production of ___________. Keywords for the question: Swiss Pays d’Enhaut, revived, production, Take a look at section C. In paragraph no. 2, the writer says, “ . .. .. Local concern about the rising number of second home developments In the Swiss Pays d’Enhaut resulted in limits being imposed on their growth. There has also been a renaissance in communal cheese production in the area, providing the locals with a reliable source of income that does not depend on outside visitors.” Here, renaissance in communal cheese production = revived production of cheese, So, the answer is: cheese Question no. 11: People/Location: Arctic communities Activity: Operate ___________ businesses. Keywords for the question: Arctic communities, operate, businesses, Again, in section C, take a look at paragraph no. 3. In lines 3-4, the writer says, “ . .. But some Arctic communities are now operating tour businesses themselves, thereby ensuring that the benefits accrue locally. … .” So, the answer is: tourism/tourist/tour Question no. 12: People/Location: Acoma and San Ildefonso Activity: Produce and sell ___________. Keywords for the question: Acoma and San Ildefonso, produce, sell, In paragraph no. 4 of section C, the author says in lines 3-4, “ .. . The Acoma and San Ildefonso pueblos have established highly profitable pottery businesses, ….” Here, businesses = produce and sell, So, the answer is: pottery Question no. 13: People/Location: Navajo and Hopi Activity: Produce and sell ___________. Keywords for the question: Navajo and Hopi, produce, sell, In paragraph no. 4 of section C, the author says in lines 4-5, “ .. . while the Navajo and Hopi groups have been similarly successful with Jewellery.” Here, similarly successful = successful in producing and selling, So, the answer is: jewelry/ jewellery Reading Passage 2: Questions 14-26 The headline of the passage: Flawed Beauty: the problem with toughened glass Questions 14-17: Matching statements with a list of people [In this type of question, candidates need to relate statements that are given by or link to people in the passage. The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the name of the person and read around it carefully. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same person in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions may not follow any sequential order.] Question no. 14: Brian Waldron Keywords for the question: Brian Waldron At the very first paragraph, the nickel sulphide failure of a glass pane in the town of Cirencester in the UK is mentioned. Then, in the next paragraph (paragraph no. 2) we can see a comment made by Brian Waldron. “The glass industry is aware of the issue,’ says Brian Waldron, .. .. .. .. But he insists that cases are few and far between. ‘It’s a very rare phenomenon.’ he says.” Here, very rare phenomenon = very unusual, So, the answer is: G (claims that nickel sulphide failure is very unusual) Question no. 15: Trevor Ford Keywords for the question: Trevor Ford The answer can be found in paragraph no. 3, in lines 10-14, “ .. . . ‘What you hear is only the tip of the iceberg,’ says Trevor Ford, a glass expert at Resolve Engineering in Brisbane. Queensland. He believes the reason is simple: ‘No-one wants bad press.’” Here, No-one wants bad press = publicity about nickel sulphide has been suppressed, So, the answer is: A (suggests that publicity about nickel sulphide failure has been suppressed) Question no. 16: Graham Dodd Keywords for the question: Graham Dodd The answer to this question can be found in paragraph no. 8, in lines 6-15, “ .. . . It could happen just months after manufacture, or decades later, although if the glass is heated – by sunlight, for example – the process is speeded up. Ironically, says Graham Dodd, of consulting engineers Arup in London, the oldest pane of toughened glass known to have failed due to nickel sulphide inclusions was in Pilkington’s glass research building in Lathom, Lancashire. The pane was 27 years old.” Here, decades later 27 years old = most extreme case of delayed failure, So, the answer is: H (refers to the most extreme case of delayed failure) Questions no. 17: John Barry Keywords for the question: John Barry In the final paragraph (paragraph no. 10), the writer mentions the work of John Berry in lines 7-12, “ .. .. . John Barry, an expert in nickel sulphide contamination at the University of Queensland, analysed every glass pane in the building. Using a studio camera, a photographer went up in a cradle to take photos of every pane. … .” Here, analysed every glass pane in the building = closely examined all the glass in one building, So, the answer is: C (closely examined all the glass in one building) Questions 18-24: Completing summary with list of words [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete a summary with a list of words taken from the passage. Candidates must write the correct letter (not the words) as the answers. Keywords and synonyms are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] The title of the summary: Toughened Glass Question no. 18: Toughened glass is favoured by architects because it is much stronger than ordinary glass, and the fragments are not as ________ when it breaks. Keywords for the question: toughened glass, favoured by architects, because, much stronger than, ordinary glass, fragments, not, when it breaks, In paragraph no. 4, the writer mentions the reason why architects favour toughened glass in lines 4-11, “ .. . .. This glass has five times the strength of standard glass, and when it does break it shatters into tiny cubes rather than large, razor-sharp shards. Architects love it because large panels can be bolted together to make transparent walls, and turning it into ceilings and floors is almost as easy.” Here, five times the strength of standard glass = much stronger than ordinary glass, Architects love it = Toughened glass is favoured by architects, rather than large, razor-sharp shards = the fragments are not as sharp when it breaks, So, the answer is: F (sharp) Question no. 19: However, it has one disadvantage: it can shatter _________. Keywords for the question: however, one disadvantage, can shatter, In paragraph no. 8 the writer says in lines 4-5, “ . .. . the stresses this unleashes can shatter the whole sheet. The time that elapses before failure occurs is unpredictable. Here, The time that elapses before failure occurs is unpredictable = it can shatter unexpectedly, So, the answer is: I (unexpectedly) Question no. 20: This fault is a result of the manufacturing process. Ordinary glass is first heated, then cooled very ________. Keywords for the question: this fault, result, manufacturing process, ordinary glass, first heated, then cooled, very, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 5. At the beginning, the writer says, “It is made by heating a sheet of ordinary glass to about 620°C to soften it slightly, allowing its structure to expand, and then cooling it rapidly with jets of cold air. . . . .” Here, rapidly = quickly, So, the answer is: C (quickly) Question no. 21: The outer layer ________ before the inner layer, and the tension between the two layers which is created because of this makes the glass stronger. Keywords for the question: outer layer, before, inner layer, tension between the two layers, created, because of this, makes, glass, stronger, In paragraph no. 5, look closely at lines 5-11, “ .. . . This causes the outer layer of the pane to contract and solidify before the interior. When the interior finally solidifies and shrinks, it exerts a pull on the outer layer that leaves it in permanent compression and produces a tensile force inside the glass. .. .” Here, before the interior = before the inner layer, So, the answer is: K (contracts) Question no. 22: However, if the glass contains nickel sulphide impurities, crystals of nickel sulphide are formed. These are unstable and can expand suddenly, particularly if the weather is ________. If this happens, the pane of glass may break. Keywords for the question: however, if, glass contains, nickel sulphide impurities, crystals of nickel sulphide, formed, unstable, can expand, suddenly, particularly, if, weather, if this happens, pane of glass, may break, The answer can be found in two places. First, in paragraph no. 6, the writer provides a hint of heat that can cause damage to glass, “ .. . As the glass is heated, these atoms react to form tiny crystals of nickel sulphide. Just a tenth of a gram of nickel in the furnace can create up to 50,000 crystals.” Then, in paragraph no. 8, in lines 5-10, the writer says, “ . .. . The time that elapses before failure occurs is unpredictable. It could happen just months after manufacture, or decades later, although if the glass is heated – by sunlight, for example – the process is speeded up. .. ..” Here, sunlight, for example = warm weather, the process is speeded up = can expand suddenly, So, the answer is: E (warm) Question no. 23: The frequency with which such problems occur is _________ by glass experts. Furthermore, the crystals cannot be detected without sophisticated equipment. Keywords for the question: frequency, such problems occur, by glass experts, furthermore, crystals, cannot be, detected, without, sophisticated equipment, The last part of paragraph no. 8 and the complete paragraph no. 9 indicates that there is a big dispute over the issue of the frequency with which such problems occur. The writer says in paragraph no. 8, “ .. … Ironically, says Graham Dodd, of consulting engineers Arup in London, the oldest pane of toughened glass known to have failed due to nickel sulphide inclusions was in Pilkington’s glass research building in Lathom, Lancashire. The pane was 27 years old.” So, here, one expert (Graham Dodd) is saying that such problems happen after a long time. Now, in the next paragraph (paragraph no. 9), the writer also says, “Data showing the scale of the nickel sulphide problem is almost impossible to find. The picture is made more complicated by the fact that these crystals occur in batches. So even if on average, there is only one inclusion in 7 tonnes of glass, if you experience one nickel sulphide failure in your building, that probably means you’ve got a problem in more than one pane. Josie says that in the last decade he has worked on over 15 buildings with the number of failures into double figures.” Here, another expert (Barrie Josie) is saying that over the last 10 years he found such problems 2 times more than previous times. This suggests that the frequency with which such problems (failure due to nickel sulphide inclusions) occur is disputed among glass experts. So, the answer is: L (disputed) Questions 25-26: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 24: Little doubt was expressed about the reason for the Bishops Walk accident. Keywords for the question: little doubt, expressed about, reason, the Bishops Walk accident, In the last line of paragraph no.1, the writer comments on the Bishops Walk accident. “ .. . . they found that minute crystals of nickel sulphide trapped inside the glass had almost certainly caused the failure.” Here, almost certainly caused the failure = little doubt about the reason, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 25: Toughened glass has the same appearance as ordinary glass. Keywords for the question: toughened glass, same appearance, as, ordinary glass, In this passage, we find how ordinary glass is processed into toughened glass. However, there is no comparison of the appearance between toughened glass and ordinary glass. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 26: There is plenty of documented evidence available about the incidence of nickel sulphide failure. Keywords for the question: plenty of documented evidence, available, about, incidence of nickel sulphide failure, In the first lines of paragraph no. 9 the writer states, “Data showing the scale of the nickel sulphide problem is almost impossible to find. … .” Here, almost impossible to find = there is not enough documented evidence about the incidence of nickel sulphide failure, So, the answer is: FALSE Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40 The title of the passage: The effects of light on plant and animal species Questions 27-33: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 27: There is plenty of scientific evidence to support photoperiodism. Keywords for the question: plenty of, scientific evidence, support, photoperiodism, Take a look at lines 5-6 in paragraph no. 2, “ . .. . The seasonal impact of day length on physiological responses is called photoperiodism, and the amount of experimental evidence for this phenomenon is considerable. .. .. .” Here, experimental evidence = scientific evidence, considerable = plenty of, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 28: Some types of bird can be encouraged to breed out of season. Keywords for the question: some types, bird, can be encouraged, breed, out of season, In paragraph no. 2, lines 7-8 say, “ . .. For example, some species of birds’ breeding can be induced even in midwinter simply by increasing day length artificially (Wolfson 1964). .. .” Here, some species of birds = some types of bird, induced = encouraged, even in midwinter = out of season, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 29: Photoperiodism is restricted to certain geographic areas. Keywords for the question: Photoperiodism, restricted, certain geographic areas, In paragraphs no. 2, 3 and 4 the writer mentions ‘temperate zones’ – areas of the world that have a temperate climate. However, no mention of any geographical restriction of photoperiodism can be found in this passage. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 30: Desert annuals are examples of 1ong-day plants. Keywords for the question: desert annuals, examples, long-day plants, In paragraph no. 4 the writer says at the end, “. .. . . For example, desert annuals germinate, flower and seed whenever suitable rainfall occurs, regardless of the day length.” Here, regardless of the day length = day-neutral, This means desert annuals are examples of day-neutral plants, NOT long-day plants. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 31: Bamboos flower several times during their life cycle. Keywords for the question: bamboos, flower, several times, during, life cycle, At the beginning of paragraph no. 5, the author writes, “Bamboos are perennial grasses that remain in a vegetative state for many years and then suddenly flower, fruit and die (Evans 1976). … ..” Here, suddenly flower, fruit and die = flower one time during life cycle, Then, the writer provides some statistics to support the sentence. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 32: Scientists have yet to determine the cue of Chusquea abietifolia’s seasonal rhythm. Keywords for the question: scientists, yet to determine, cue, Chusquea abietifolia’s seasonal rhythm Again, in paragraph no. 5, the writer says in lines 3-6, “. .. Every bamboo of the species Chusquea abietifolia on the island of Jamaica flowered, set seed and died during 1884. The next generation of bamboo flowered and died between 1916 and 1918, which suggests a vegetative cycle of about 31 years. The climatic trigger for this flowering cycle is not yet known, but the adaptive significance is clear.” Here, The climatic trigger for this flowering cycle = Chusquea abietifolia’s seasonal rhythm, not known yet = Scientists have yet to determine, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 33: Eastern hemlock is a fast-growing plant. Keywords for the question: Eastern hemlock, fast-growing plant, For this question, we need to go to the final paragraph. In the beginning of the paragraph, the writer says in lines 2-3, “ .. . .. Shade-tolerant plants have lower photosynthetic rates and hence have lower growth rates than those of shade-intolerant species. .. .” Then, in line no. 7, the writer says, “ . .. . For example, eastern hemlock seedlings are shade-tolerant.” As eastern hemlock is shade-tolerant plant, it has lower growth rate (slow-growing plant). So, the answer is: FALSE Questions 34-40: Completing sentences with NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS In this type of question, candidates are asked to write a maximum of three words to complete sentences on the given topic. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. [TIPS: Here scanning technique will come in handy. Target the keywords of the questions to find the answers. Remember to focus on Proper nouns, random Capital letters, numbers, special characters of text etc.] Question no. 34: Day length is a useful cue for breeding in areas where ________ are unpredictable. Keywords for the question: day length, useful cue, breeding, areas, unpredictable, The writer says in paragraph no. 2 in lines 2-5, “ .. . .. Day length is an excellent cue, because it provides a perfectly predictable pattern of change within the year. In the temperate zone in spring, temperatures fluctuate greatly from day to day, but day length increases steadily by a predictable amount. . .. ” Here, excellent cue = useful cue, fluctuate greatly from day to day = unpredictable, So, the answer is: temperatures Question no. 35: Plants which do not respond to light levels are referred to as _________. Keywords for the question: plants, do not respond, light levels, referred to, as, First, in lines 5-7, the writer explains the term that deals with response to light levels, “ .. . The seasonal impact of day length on physiological responses is called photoperiodism, and the amount or experimental evidence for this phenomenon is considerable. .. . ” Then, in lines 11-12 of the same paragraph, the writer says, “ . .. . Plants which flower after a period of vegetative growth, regardless of photoperiod, are known as day-neutral plants.” Here, regardless of photoperiod = do not respond to light levels, known as = referred to as, So, the answer is: day-neutral (plants) Question no. 36: Birds in temperate climates associate longer days with nesting and the availability of __________. Keywords for the question: birds, temperature climates, associate, longer days, nesting, availability of, Let’s have a close look at paragraph no. 3. Here, the author of the passage says in lines 4-6, “ . .. . Thus many temperate-zone birds use the increasing day lengths in spring as a cue to begin the nesting cycle, because this is a point when adequate food resources will be assured.” Here, temperate-zone birds = Birds in temperate climates, increasing day lengths = longer days, will be assured = availability, So, the answer is: (adequate) food (resources) Question no. 37: Plants that flower when days are long often depend on _________ to help them reproduce. Keywords for the question: plants, flower, days are long, often, depend on, help them reproduce, The answer to this question can be traced in paragraph no. 4, in lines 3-4, “ . .. Long-day plants are adapted for situations that require fertilization by insects, or a long period of seed ripening. .. .” Here, Long-day plants = Plants that flower when days are long, require = depend on, So, the answer is: (fertilization/fertilisation by) insects Question no. 38: Desert annuals respond to ________ as a signal for reproduction. Keywords for the question: desert annuals, respond, as a signal, reproduction, The answer can be found in the last lines paragraph no. 4, “ .. . Day-neutral plants have an evolutionary advantage when the connection between the favourable period for reproduction and day length is much less certain. For example, desert annuals germinate, flower and seed whenever suitable rainfall occurs, regardless of the day length.” Here, germinate, flower and seed = respond, So, the answer is: (suitable) rainfall Question no. 39: There is no limit to the photosynthetic rate in plants such as___________. Keywords for the question: no limit, photosynthetic rate, plants, such as, In paragraph no. 6, the last few lines say, “ . .. Some plants reach maximal photosynthesis at one-quarter full sunlight, and others, like sugarcane, never reach a maximum, but continue to increase photosynthesis rate as light intensity rises.” Here, never reach a maximum = no limit to the photosynthetic rate, So, the answer is: sugarcane Question no. 40: Tolerance to shade is one criterion for the ________ of plants in forestry and horticulture. Keywords for the question: tolerance to shade, one criterion, plants in forestry and horticulture, The first two lines of the final paragraph give us the answer to this question. The author says here, “ . .. . Plants in general can be divided into two groups: shade-tolerant species and shade-intolerant species. This classification is commonly used in forestry and horticulture. Here, shade-tolerant species and shade-intolerant species = tolerance to shade, So, the answer is: classification",

      "content_clean": "Reading Passage 1: Questions 1-13 The headline of the passage: AUSTRALIA’S SPORTING SUCCESS Questions 1-7: Identifying information [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question no. 1: A reference to the exchange of expertise between different sports Keywords for the question: exchange, expertise, between different sports, The answer can be found in paragraph B. At the beginning the writer says in lines 1-3, “. . .. .The AIS employs more than 100 sports scientists and doctors, and collaborates with scores of others in universities and research centres. AIS scientists work across a number of sports, .. .. .” Here, collaborates = work together, scientists and doctors = experts, a number of sports = different sports, work across = exchange, This sentence suggests that Australian sports scientists and doctors share their expertise across different sports. So, the answer is: B Question no. 2: An explanation of how visual imaging is employed in investigation Keywords for the question: how, visual imaging, employed, investigation, In the middle of paragraph C the writer explains how the visual imaging works to help in the investigation. Read carefully lines 6-10, “ . .. . To demonstrate how the system works, Bruce Mason at AIS shows off the prototype of a 3D analysis tool for studying swimmers. A wire-frame model of a champion swimmer slices through the water, her arms moving in slow motion. Looking side-on, Mason measures the distance between strokes. From above, he analyses how her spine swivels. When fully developed, this system will enable him to build a biomechanical profile for coaches to use to help budding swimmers.” Here, prototype of a 3D analysis tool = visual imaging tool, So, the answer is: C Question no. 3: A reason for narrowing the scope of research activity Keywords for the question: reason, narrowing, scope, research activity, At the end of paragraph B, Peter Fricker, chief of science at AIS explains why the scope of research activity needs to be narrowed. Read lines 5-7, “ .. .. . They all focus on one aim: winning.‘ We can’t waste our time looking at ethereal scientific questions that don’t help the coach work with an athlete and improve performance,’. … .” Here, We can’t waste our time = we must narrow the scope of research activity, So, the answer is: B Question no. 4: How some AIS ideas have been reproduced Keywords for the question: how, some AIS ideas, reproduced, Paragraph F details about some AIS ideas that had been copied in different times, “ .. . . Some years ago, the AIS unveiled coolant-lined jackets for endurance athletes. At the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, these sliced as much as two per cent off cyclists’ and rowers’ times. Now everyone uses them. The same has happened to the ‘altitude tent’, developed by AIS to replicate the effect of altitude training at sea level.” Here, Now everyone uses them = all other countries have copied them, replicate = copy / reproduced, So, the answer is: F Question no. 5: How obstacles to optimum achievement can be investigated Keywords for the question: how, obstacles, optimum achievement, can be investigated, The answer can be found in paragraph D where Bruce Mason at AIS explains how obstacles to highest achievement can be investigated. First, take a look at lines 1-4, “. .. . He points out the data on the swimmers in second and third place, which shows that the one who finished third actually swam faster. So why did he finish 35 hundredths of a second down? ‘His turn times were 44 hundredths of a second behind the other guy,’ says Mason. ‘If he can improve on his turns, he can do much better.’ . .. .” Then take a look at lines 6-9, “ . .. . With the Cooperative Research Centre for Micro Technology in Melbourne, they are developing unobtrusive sensors that will be embedded in an athlete’s clothes or running shoes to monitor heart rate, sweating, heat production or any other factor that might have an impact on an athlete’s ability to run.” These lines suggest the way of investigating the obstacles / obstructions to optimum / best achievement / result. So, the answer is: D Question no. 6: An overview of the funded support of athletes Keywords for the question: overview, funded support, athletes, The answer is found in lines 5-7 of paragraph A, “ . .. . Another body, the Australian Sports Commission (ASC), finances programmes of excellence in a total of 96 sports for thousands of sportsmen and women.” Here, finances = funded support, So, the answer is: A Question no. 7: How performance requirements are calculated before an event Keywords for the question: how, performance requirements, calculated, before, event, The first few lines of paragraph E give us the answer, “ . .. .. Well before a championship, sports scientists and coaches start to prepare the athlete by developing a ‘competition model’, based on what they expect will be the winning times.” Here, Well before a championship = before an event, prepare the athlete by developing a ‘competition model’ = performance requirements are calculated, So, the answer is: E Questions 8-11: Classifying groups [This type of question asks candidates to classify information from the given reading text. Candidates are given some groups from the text, and a list of options, which are listed as A, B, C etc. They must match the correct groups with the correct options. N.B.: This question doesn’t follow any sequence. So, they should be answered after all other questions in the passage.] Question no. 8: cameras Keywords for the question: cameras, In paragraph C lines 11-14 say, “. .. . . Mason’s contribution to sport also includes the development of the SWAN (SWimming ANalysis) system now used in Australian national competitions. It collects images from digital cameras running at 50 frames a second and breaks down each part of a swimmer’s performance into factors that can be analysed individually – . …. .” Here, It collects images from digital cameras means cameras are currently exclusively used by Australians. So, the answer is: A (are currently exclusively used by Australians) Question no. 9: sensors Keywords for the question: sensors, In paragraph D lines 6-9 talk about the use of sensors in the future, “. .. . With the Cooperative Research Centre for Micro Technology in Melbourne, they are developing unobtrusive sensors that will be embedded in an athlete’s clothes or running shoes to monitor heart rate, sweating, heat production or any other factor that might have an impact on an athlete’s ability to run.” So, the answer is: B (will be used in the future by Australians) Question no. 10: protein tests Keywords for the question: protein tests, The answer to this question can also be found in paragraph D, “ … . . After years of experimentation, AIS and the University of Newcastle in New South Wales developed a test that measures how much of the immune-system protein immunoglobulin A is present in athletes’ saliva. If IgA levels suddenly fall below a certain level, training is eased or dropped altogether. Soon, IgA levels start rising again, and the danger passes. Since the tests were introduced, AIS athletes in all sports have been remarkably successful at staying healthy.” This means protein tests are currently used by AIS athletes (Australians). So, the answer is: A (are currently exclusively used by Australians) Question no. 11: altitude tents Keywords for the question: altitude tents, Take a look at these lines paragraph F, “. . .. Some years ago, the AIS unveiled coolant-lined jackets for endurance athletes. At the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, these sliced as much as two per cent off cyclists’ and rowers’ times. Now everyone uses them. The same has happened to the ‘altitude tent’, developed by AIS to replicate the effect of altitude training at sea level..” Here, everyone uses them The same has happened to mean that altitude tents are used by both Australians and their rivals. So, the answer is: C (are currently used by both Australians and their rivals) Questions 12-13: Short answer to open questions (NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER) [In this kind of questions candidates have to answer some questions, only with some conditions like NO MORE THAN THREE/TWO WORDS and/or A NUMBER or, ONE WORD ONLY. Each question has keywords which will lead to the answer. This question type generally follows a sequence.] Question no. 12: What is produced to help an athlete plan their performance in an event? Keywords for the question: produced, help, athlete, plan, performance, event, The answer can be found at the beginning of paragraph E, “.. .. Well before a championship, sports scientists and coaches start to prepare the athlete by developing a ‘competition model’, based on what they expect will be the winning times.” Here, prepare = start to produced, Well before a championship what they expect will be the winning times = plan their performance in an event, So, the answer is: (a) competition model Question no. 13: By how much did some cyclists’ performance improve at the 1996 Olympic Games? Keywords for the question: how much, some cyclists’ performance, improve, 1996 Olympic Games, The KEYPHRASE ‘how much’ indicates that the answer has to be a number. Take a look at paragraph F in lines 2-3, “ .. .. At the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, these sliced as much as two per cent off cyclists’ and rowers’ times.” Here, sliced . . .. . off = performance improve by, So, the answer is: (by) 2 per cent/ percent/ % Reading Passage 2: Questions 14-26 The headline of the passage: DELIVERING THE GOODS Questions 14-17: Identifying information [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question no. 14: a suggestion for improving trade in the future Keywords for the question: suggestion, improving trade, in the future, A special TIP: questions like this one where you have to find ‘a solution for the coming days / future’, you should take a look at the last two paragraphs. You will always find your answers there. For this question, we have to go to the last paragraph and search for solutions or suggestions to improve trade in the future. Take a look at the last lines of paragraph I, “ .. . .. Bringing these barriers down would help the world’s economies grow even closer.” Here, Bringing these barriers down = a suggestion, would help = indicates the future, the world’s economies grow even closer = improving trade, So, the answer is: I Question no. 15: the effects of the introduction of electronic delivery Keywords for the question: effects, introduction of electronic delivery, The answer can be found in paragraph F. Here, lines 2-5 say, “. . .. . Computer software can be ‘exported’ without ever loading it onto a ship, simply by transmitting it over telephone lines from one country to another, so freight rates and cargo-handling schedules become insignificant factors in deciding where to make the product. .. .. .” Here, simply by transmitting it over telephone lines = electronic delivery, so freight rates and cargo-handling schedules become insignificant factors in deciding where to make the product = the effects, So, the answer is: F Question no. 16: the similar cost involved in transporting a product from abroad or from a local supplier Keywords for the question: similar cost, transporting, product, from abroad, from a local supplier, The answer can be found in paragraph E. Take a look at these lines, “. . .. . Computer manufacturers in Japan or Texas will not face hugely bigger freight bills if they import drives from Singapore rather than purchasing them on the domestic market. , .. .. .” Here, import drives from Singapore = transporting a product from abroad, domestic market = local supplier, Also, Computer manufacturers in Japan or Texas will not face hugely bigger freight bills means that companies do not want to spend more money on products that are priced the same in a local or foreign market. So, the answer is: E Question no. 17: the weakening relationship between the value of goods and the cost of their delivery Keywords for the question: weakening relationship, between, value of goods, the cost of their delivery, The answer can be found in paragraph D. At the beginning the writer says in lines 1-2, “. . .. . Over time, however, world output has shifted into goods whose worth is unrelated to their size and weight., .. .. .” Then the writer says again in the end, “. .. thanks to technological advances such as lightweight components, manufactured goods themselves have tended to become lighter and less bulky. As a result, less transportation is required for every dollar’s worth of imports or exports.” Here, goods whose worth is unrelated to their size and weight = the price of some goods does not match with their size and weight, Also, less transportation is required for every dollar’s worth of imports or exports = the relationship between value of goods and their transportation cost is becoming weak, So, the answer is: D Questions 18-22: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 18: International trade is increasing at a greater rate than the world economy. Keywords for the question: international trade, increasing, greater rate, than, world economy, The answer can be found in the first lines of paragraph A. The writer says, “International trade is growing at a startling pace. While the global economy has been expanding at a bit over 3% a year, the volume of trade has been rising at a compound annual rate of about twice that.” Here, is growing = is increasing, global economy = world economy, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 19: Cheap labour guarantees effective trade conditions. Keywords for the question: cheap labour, guarantees, effective trade conditions, The answer can be found in paragraph B. At the end of the paragraph the writer says, “. . .. . Cheap labour may make Chinese clothing competitive in America, but if delays in shipment lie up working capital and cause winter coats to arrive in spring, trade may lose its advantages.” Here, the writer means that cheap labour may work as a contributory factor but it cannot guarantee an effective trade condition; delivery in proper time guarantees that. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 20: Japan imports more meat and steel than France. Keywords for the question: Japan, imports, more meat and steel, than France, We can find the words Japan, France, meat and steel, in paragraph C. However, we can’t find any comparison on the import of meat and steel between Japan and France. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 21: Most countries continue to prefer to trade with nearby nations. Keywords for the question: most countries, continue to prefer, trade, nearby nations, The answer can be found at the very beginning of paragraph D. The author says in line no. 1, Countries still trade disproportionately with their geographic neighbours.” Here, still trade = continue to prefer to trade, geographical neighbours = nearby nations, The line is a clear match to the question. So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 22: Small computer components are manufactured in Germany. Keywords for the question: small computer components, manufactured, Germany, Information about computer components is included in paragraph E. However, Germany is not mentioned in this paragraph. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Questions 23-26: Completing summary with list of words: [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete a summary with a list of words taken from the passage. Candidates must write the correct letter (not the words) as the answers. Keywords and synonyms are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Title of the summary: THE TRANSPORT REVOLUTION Question no. 23: Modern cargo-handling methods have had a significant effect on ___________ as the business of moving freight around the world becomes increasingly streamlined. Keywords for the question: modern cargo-handling methods, significant effect, moving freight, around the world, increasingly streamlined, The answer can be found in paragraph D. The writer says here, “. . .. Over time, however, world output has shifted into goods whose worth is unrelated to their size and weight. Today, it is finished manufactured products that dominate the flow of trade, and, thanks to technological advances such as lightweight components, manufactured goods themselves have tended to become lighter and less bulky. .” Here, dominate = significant effect, streamlined = manufactured goods themselves have tended to become lighter and less bulky, technological advances = modern cargo-handling methods, So, the answer is: G (trade) Question no. 24: Manufacturers of computers, for instance, are able to import ___________ from overseas, rather than having to rely on a local supplier. Keywords for the question: manufactures, computers, able to import, from overseas, than, rely on, local supplier, The answer can be found in paragraphs D and E. In paragraph D, the writer talks about ‘lightweight components’ as manufactured goods. Then in paragraph E, the writer says, “ . . . Computer manufacturers in Japan or Texas will not face hugely bigger freight bills if they import drives from Singapore rather than purchasing them on the domestic market.” Here, Computer manufacturers in Japan = manufacturers of computers, drives = components, Singapore = overseas, domestic market = local supplier, So, the answer is: B (components) Question no. 25: The introduction of __________ has meant that bulk cargo can be safely and efficiently moved over long distances. Keywords for the question: introduction, meant, bulk cargo, safely, efficiently, moved, long distances, Here, bulk cargo means heavy or large goods transported from one place to other. The author says in paragraph G, “ . .. . Forty years ago, the process of exporting or importing involved a great many stages of handling, which risked portions of the shipment being damaged or stolen along the way. The invention of the container crane made it possible to load and unload containers without capsizing the ship and the adoption of standard container sizes allowed almost any box to be transported on any ship.” Here, the invention of the container crane = the introduction of container ships with crane, without capsizing = safely and efficiently, So, the answer is: C (container ships) Question no. 26: While international shipping is now efficient, there is still a need for governments to reduce __________ in order to free up the domestic cargo sector. Keywords for the question: international shipping, efficient, still a need, governments, reduce, in order to, free up, domestic cargo sector, The answer can be found in paragraph H where the writer talks about tariffs. The writer says here, “ . .. . The shipping container transformed ocean shipping into a highly efficient, intensely competitive business. But getting the cargo to and from the dock was a different story. National governments, by and large, kept a much firmer hand on truck and railroad tariffs than on charges for ocean freight. This started changing, however, in the mid-1970s, when America began to deregulate its transportation industry. First airlines, then road haulers and railways, were freed from restrictions on what they could carry, where they could haul it and what price they could charge. Big productivity gains resulted.” Here, the writer explains how lowering truck and railroad tariffs can increase productivity and suggests that government should reduce tariffs. So, the answer is: A (tariffs) Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40 The headline of the passage: Climate change and the Inuit Questions 27-32: List of headings: [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph which will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question no. 27: Paragraph B In paragraph B the writer mentions the reaction of the Inuit community to climate change. In lines 3-4 the writer says, “.. .. Nobody knows the Arctic as well as the locals, which is why they are not content simply to stand back and let outside experts tell them what’s happening.” Here, they are not content means the Inuit people are not happy. Again, in the last few lines, the writer mentions, “ .. . . they believe their best hope of survival in this changing environment lies in combining their ancestral knowledge with the best of modern science. This is a challenge in itself.” So, the answer is: i (The reaction of the Inuit community to climate change) Question no. 28: Paragraph C Paragraph C highlights the harsh and challenging landscape of the polar desert known as the North Pole. Take a look at phrases and sentences like ‘vast, treeless polar desert’, ‘some idea of the hardships’, ‘Farming is out of the question and nature offers meagre pickings’, ‘The environment tested them to the limits’ etc. So, the answer is: vi (A difficult landscape) Question no. 29: Paragraph D For this question, we have to go to the last part of Paragraph D. The writer explains here about the alternative sources of necessary supplies, “ . .. . Provisions available in local shops have to be flown into Nunavut on one of the most costly air networks in the world, or brought by supply ship during the few ice-free weeks of summer. It would cost a family around £7,000 a year to replace meat they obtained themselves through hunting with imported meat. ….. .” Here, Provisions = essential supplies, imported meat = alternative sources of supplies, So, the answer is: iii (Alternative sources of essential supplies) Question no. 30: Paragraph E The first lines of paragraph E says, “While the Inuit may not actually starve if hunting and trapping are curtailed by climate change, there has certainly been an impact on people’s health. . .. .” Here, impact = negative effects, people’s health = well-being, So, the answer is: vii (Negative effects on well-being) Question no. 31: Paragraph F The first few lines of paragraph F gives us the answer to this question, “With so much at stake, the Inuit are determined to play a key role in teasing out the mysteries of climate change in the Arctic. Having survived there for centuries, they believe their wealth of traditional knowledge is vital to the task. And Western scientists are starting to draw on this wisdom,. .. ..” Here, Western scientists are starting to draw on this wisdom = respect for limit opinion grows, So, the answer is: iv (Respect for limit opinion grows) Question no. 32: Paragraph G In paragraph G, take a look at lines 2-5, “. .. . . Others, however, point out that the first weather stations in the far north date back just 50 years. There are still huge gaps in our environmental knowledge, and despite the scientific onslaught, many predictions are no more than best guesses. .. .. .” Here, date back just 50 years, There are still huge gaps, many predictions are no more than best guesses all mean that the knowledge or understanding of climate change is limited. So, the answer is: ii (Understanding of climate change remains limited) Questions 33-40: Summary completion (with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS): [In this kind of question candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps.] Question no. 33: If you visit the Canadian Arctic, you immediately appreciate the problems faced by people for whom this is home. It would clearly be impossible for the people to engage in __________as a means of supporting themselves. Keywords for the question: visit the Canadian Arctic, immediately appreciate, problems, would be clearly impossible, to engage in, means of supporting themselves, The answer can be found at the beginning of paragraph C. The writer says here, The Canadian Arctic is a vast, treeless polar desert that’s covered with snow for most of the year. Venture into this terrain and you get some idea of the hardships facing anyone who calls this home. Farming is out of the question and nature offers meagre pickings. . .. .” Here, Venture into this terrain = if you visit the Canadian Arctic, get some idea of the hardships = you immediately appreciate the problems, out of the question = clearly be impossible for the people to engage, So, the answer is: farming Question no. 34 35: For thousands of years they have had to rely on catching 34. _________ and 35. _________ as a means of sustenance. Keywords for the question: thousands of years, rely on, catching, as a means of sustenance, The writer says in paragraph C in lines 4-5, “. .. .. Humans first settled in the Arctic a mere 4,500 years ago, surviving by exploiting sea mammals and fish. .. .. .” Here, 4,500 years ago = thousands of years ago, surviving by exploiting = have had to rely on catching . .. . as a means of sustenance, So, the answers are: (in any order) sea mammals fish Question no. 36: The harsh surroundings saw many who tried to settle there pushed to their limits, although some were successful. The _________ people were an example of the latter and for them the environment did not prove unmanageable. Keywords for the question: harsh surroundings, tried to settle, pushed to their limits, although, some, successful, example, latter, environment, did not prove unmanageable, The answer can be found at the end of paragraph C. The writer says here, “. . .. The environment tested them to the limits: sometimes the colonists were successful, sometimes they failed and vanished. But around a thousand years ago, one group emerged that was uniquely well adapted to cope with the Arctic environment. These Thule people moved in from Alaska, . .” Here, tested them to the limits = many who tried to settle there pushed to their limits, one group emerged that was uniquely well adapted to cope with = some were successful, an example = these, So, the answer is: Thule Question no. 37: For the present inhabitants, life continues to be a struggle. The territory of Nunavut consists of little more than ice, rock and a few __________ . Keywords for the question: present inhabitants, life, struggle, territory of Nunavut, consists of, little more than ice, rock, few, In the beginning of paragraph D, the author mentions, “. . .. Life for the descendants of the Thule people is still harsh. Nunavut is 1.9 million square kilometres of rock and ice, and a handful of islands around the North Pole.. .” Here, the descendants of the Thule people = the present inhabitants, harsh = struggle, a handful of = a few, So, the answer is: islands Question no. 38 39: In recent years, many of them have been obliged to give up their 38. _________ lifestyle, but they continue to depend mainly on 39. _________ for their food and clothes. Keywords for the question: recent years, have been obliged to give up, lifestyle, but, continue to, depend mainly on, for food and clothes, The answer can be found in paragraph D. The writer says here in lines 3-5, “. . .. Over the past 40 years, most have abandoned their nomadic ways and settled in the territory’s 28 isolated communities, but they still rely heavily on nature to provide food and clothing.. . .” Here, Over the past 40 years = in recent years, most have abandoned = many of them have been obliged to give up, ways = lifestyle, still rely heavily on = but they continue to depend on, So, the answers are: nomadic nature Question no. 40: _________ produce is particularly expensive. Keywords for the question: produce, particularly expensive, Again, the answer can be found in paragraph D. The author says here in lines 6-9, “. . .. Provisions available in local shops have to be flown into Nunavut on one of the most costly air networks in the world, or brought by supply ship during the few ice-free weeks of summer. It would cost a family around £7,000 a year to replace meat they obtained themselves through hunting with imported meat.. .” Here, Provisions available in local shops have to be flown = supplies are imported, £7,000 a year = particularly expensive, So, the answer is: Imported (must use capital letter)",

Candidates must write the correct letter (not the words) as the answers. Keywords and synonyms are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Question no. 14 15: Research carried out by scientists in the United States has shown that the proportion of people over 65 suffering from the most common age-related medical problems is 14. _________ and that the speed of this change is 15. ________. Keywords for the question: research, United States, proportion, people over 65, suffering from, most common age-related medical problems, speed, change, In paragraph no. 2 the author states in lines 1-6, “In the last 14 years, the National Long-term Health Care Survey has gathered data on the health and lifestyles of more than 20,000 men and women over 65. Researchers, now analysing the results of data gathered in 1994, say arthritis, high blood pressure and circulation problems – the major medical complaints in this age group – are troubling a smaller proportion every year. And the data confirms that the rate at which these diseases are declining continues to accelerate… . . .” Here, men and women over 65 = people over 65, the major medical complaints in this age group = the most common age-related medical problems, the rate = the proportion, are declining = falling (B), to accelerate = the speed is increasing (I) So, the answers are: B (falling) I (increasing) Question no. 16: It also seems that these diseases are affecting people _________ in life than they did in the past. Keywords for the question: seems, these diseases, affecting people, in life, than, in the past, For this question’s answer, we have to look at paragraph no. 3. Here, in lines 2-3, the writer says, “ . . .. He says the problems doctors accepted as normal in a 65-year-old in 1982 are often not appearing until people are 70 or 75.” Here, the problems = these diseases, often not appearing until people are 70 or 75 = often affecting people later in life (70 or 75). So, the answer is: F (later) Question no. 17 18: This is largely due to developments in 17. ________ but other factors such as improved 18. _________ may also be playing a part. Keywords for the question: largely, due to, developments, but, other factors such as, improved, may be, playing a part, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 4. Here, the writer says in lines 1-4, “Clearly, certain diseases are beating a retreat in the face of medical advances. But there may be other contributing factors. Improvements in childhood nutrition in the first quarter of the twentieth century, for example, gave today’s elderly people a better start in life than their predecessors.” Here, in the face of medical advances = developments in medicine, other contributing factors = other factors, Improvements in childhood nutrition = improved nutrition, So, the answers are: M (medicine) J (nutrition) Question no. 19: Increases in some other illnesses may be due to changes in personal habits and to ________. Keywords for the question: increases, some other illnesses, may be, due to, changes, personal habits, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 5. The author says here in lines 1-3, “On the downside, the data also reveals failures in public health that have caused surges in some illnesses. An increase in some cancers and bronchitis may reflect changing smoking habits and poorer air quality, say the researchers. . .. .” Here, An increase in some cancers and bronchitis = Increases in some other illnesses, smoking habits = personal habits, poorer air quality = pollution, So, the answer is: N (pollution) Question no. 20: The research establishes a link between levels of _________ and life expectancy. Keywords for the question: research, establishes, link between, levels of, life expectancy, In paragraph no. 6 the author writes in the beginning, “One interesting correlation Manton uncovered is that better-educated people are likely to live longer. .. .. .” Here, correlation = link, likely to live longer = life expectancy, better-educated people = education, So, the answer is: K (education) Question no. 21 22: It also shows that there has been a considerable reduction in the number of elderly people who are 21. _________ which means that the 22. _________ involved in supporting this section of the population may be less than previously predicted. Keywords for the question: considerable reduction, number of elderly people, who are, means, involved in, supporting, this section of population, may be, less than, previously predicted, In paragraph no. 7, the writer says in lines 4-9, “.. .. . That represents a significant drop in the number of disabled old people in the population. If the trends apparent in the United States 14 years ago had continued, researchers calculate there would be an additional one million disabled elderly people in today’s population. According to Manton, slowing the trend has saved the United States government’s Medicare system more than $200 billion, suggesting that the greying of America’s population may prove less of a financial burden than expected.” Here, significant drop = considerable reduction, disabled old people = elderly people who are disabled (G), may prove less = may be less, financial burden = cost (A), So, the answers are: G (disabled) A (cost) Questions 23-26: Completing/Matching sentences with correct endings: [For this type of question, candidates need to match the beginning and ending of sentences. Candidates need to look for keywords in the sentence-beginnings and find the relative paragraphs and then sentences in the passage. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question no. 23: Home medical aids Keywords for the question: home medical aids, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 8. The writer says here, “The increasing self-reliance of many elderly people is probably linked to a massive increase in the use of simple home medical aids. .. . . .” Here, increasing self-reliance of many elderly people = old people to be more independent, So, the answer is: G (allow old people to be more independent.) Question no. 24: Regular amounts of exercise Keywords for the question: regular amounts of exercise, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 9. In this paragraph, the writer says, “Maintaining a level of daily physical activity may help mental functioning, says Carl Cotman, a neuroscientist at the University of California at Irvine. He found that rats that exercise on a treadmill have raised levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor coursing through their brains. Cotman believes this hormone, which keeps neurons functioning, may prevent the brains of active humans from deteriorating.” Here, Maintaining a level of daily physical activity = Regular amounts of exercise, may prevent the brains of active humans from deteriorating = help prevent mental decline, So, the answer is: E (may help prevent mental decline.) Question no. 25: Feelings of control over life Keywords for the question: feelings, control over life, Here, bulk cargo means heavy or large goods transported from one place to other. The author says in paragraph no. 10, “ . .. . found a connection between self-esteem and stress in people over 70. In laboratory simulations of challenging activities such as driving, those who felt in control of their lives pumped out lower levels of stress hormones such as cortisol.” Here, felt in control of their lives = feelings of control over life, lower levels of stress hormones = reduce stress in difficult situations, So, the answer is: H (can reduce stress in difficult situations.) Question no. 26: Feelings of loneliness Keywords for the question: feelings of loneliness, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 11 in lines 1-2, “ . .. . Seeman found that elderly people who felt emotionally isolated maintained higher levels of stress hormones even when asleep. … . .” Here, felt emotionally isolated = feelings of loneliness, maintained higher levels of stress hormones = cause rise in levels of stress hormones, So, the answer is: C (may cause rises in levels of stress hormones.) Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40 The headline of the passage: Numeration Questions 27-31: Completing/Matching sentences with correct endings [For this type of question, candidates need to match the beginning and end of sentences. Candidates need to look for keywords in the sentence-beginnings and find the relative paragraphs and then sentences in the passage. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question no. 27: A developed system of numbering – Keywords for the question: developed system, numbering, In paragraph no. 2, the writer mentions the reason for the need of a developed system of numbering. In line no. 3 take a look at the phrase ‘our ancestors’. Then in lines 7-8, the writer says, “. . . . As they began to settle, grow plants and herd animals, the need for a sophisticated number system became paramount. … .” Here, they (our ancestors) = people, to settle, grow plants and herd animals = began farming, sophisticated number system = developed system of numbering, So, the answer is: B (was necessary when people began farming.) Question no. 28: An additional hand signal – Keywords for the question: additional, hand signal, Paragraph no. 3 highlights the use of hand signals and discusses some types of hand signals first. Then, in lines 5-8 the writer explains, “ . .. For example, when using the one, two, many type of system, the word many would mean, ‘Look at my hands and see how many fingers I am showing you’. This basic approach is limited in the range of numbers that it can express, but this range will generally suffice when dealing with the simpler aspects of human existence. Here, the one, two, many type of system = additional hand signal, limited in the range of numbers = range of number word was restricted, So, the answer is: E (was used when the range of number words was restricted.) Question no. 29: In seventh-century Europe, the ability to count to a certain number – Keywords for the question: seventh-century, Europe, ability, count, certain number, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 4 where the keywords ‘seventh-century’ and ‘Europe’ can be found.

In fact, to qualify as a witness in a court of law a man had to be able to count to nine!” Here, to qualify as a witness in a court of law = to fulfill a civic role, had to be able to = was necessary, So, the answer is: A (was necessary in order to fulfill a civic role.) Question no. 30: Thinking about numbers as concepts separate from physical objects – Keywords for the question: thinking, numbers, concepts, separate from, physical objects, The answer is in paragraph no.5. First, the writer says at the beginning of the paragraph, “Perhaps the most fundamental step in developing a sense of number is not the ability to count, but rather to see that a number is really an abstract idea instead of a simple attachment to a group of particular objects.” Here, an abstract idea = concepts, group of particular objects = physical objects, Then, in the final lines of paragraph no. 5, the writer says, “… .. . When the number 4 can be registered in the mind as a specific word, independent of the object being referenced, the individual is ready to take the first step toward the development of a notational system for numbers and, from there, to arithmetic.” Here, the first step toward the development of a notational system for numbers and, from there, to arithmetic = development of arithmetic, So, the answer is: C (was necessary for the development of arithmetic.) Question no. 31: Expressing number differently according to class of item – Keywords for the question: expressing number, differently, according to, class of item, The writer says in paragraph no. 6, “ .. . . Traces of the very first stages in the development of numeration can be seen in several living languages today. The numeration system of the Tsimshian language in British Columbia contains seven distinct sets of words for numbers according to the class of the item being counted: for counting flat objects and animals, for round objects and time, for people, for long objects and trees, for canoes, for measures, and for counting when no particular object is being numerated. .. . ..” Here, Traces of the very first stages in the development of numeration = characteristics of early numeration systems, So, the answer is: G (was a characteristic of early numeration systems.) Questions 32-40: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 32: For the earliest tribes, the concept of sufficiency was more important than the concept of quantity. Keywords for the question: earliest tribes, sufficiency, more important, than, quantity, Let’s read the second paragraph. The author mentions here in lines 2-4, “ . .. Even the earliest of tribes had a system of numeration that, if not advanced, was sufficient for the tasks that they had to perform. Our ancestors had little use for actual numbers; . . . .” Here, was sufficient for the tasks that they had to perform = the concept of sufficiency was more important, Our ancestors had little use for actual numbers = the concept of quantity was less important, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 33: Indigenous Tasmanians used only four terms to indicate numbers of objects. Keywords for the question: Indigenous Tasmanians, used, only four terms, indicate, numbers of objects, The answer can be traced in lines 1-2 of paragraph no. 3, “ . .. The indigenous peoples of Tasmania were only able to count one, two, many; . .. .” Here, The indigenous peoples of Tasmania = Indigenous Tasmanians, able to count = used, one, two, many = three terms, So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 34: Some peoples with simple number systems use body language to prevent misunderstanding of expressions of number. Keywords for the question: some people, simple number systems, use, body language, to prevent, misunderstanding, expressions of number, Again, in the third paragraph, lines 3-4 say, “ . . . But in real situations the number and words are often accompanied by gestures to help resolve any confusion. . .. .” Here, often accompanied by gestures = use body languages, resolve any confusion = prevent misunderstanding of expressions, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 35: All cultures have been able to express large numbers clearly. Keywords for the question: all cultures, have been able, to express, large numbers, clearly, The writer says in paragraph no. 4 in line no. 1, “The lack of ability of some cultures to deal with large numbers is not really surprising. .. . …” Here, lack of ability of some cultures to deal with large numbers = Not all cultures have been able to express large numbers clearly, So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 36: The word ‘thousand’ has Anglo-Saxon origins. Keywords for the question: word ‘thousand’, Anglo-Saxon origins, The author talks about the Anglo-Saxon language in paragraph no. 4 providing a list of words and their origins. We can find only the numbers 10 and 100, but there is no discussion about the origin of the number ‘thousand’. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 37: In general, people in seventh-century Europe had poor counting ability. Keywords for the question: in general, people, seventh-century, Europe, poor counting ability, At the end of paragraph no. 4 the writer says, “ . .. The average person in the seventh century in Europe was not as familiar with numbers as we are today. .. ..” Here, The average person in the seventh century = In general, people in seventh-century Europe, not as familiar with numbers = poor counting ability, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 38: In the Tsimshian language, the number for long objects and canoes is expressed with the same word. Keywords for the question: Tsimshian language, number for long objects, canoes, expressed, same word, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 6. The writer says here in lines 2-5, “. . .. The numeration system of the Tsimshian language in British Columbia contains seven distinct sets of words for numbers according to the class of the item being counted: for counting flat objects and animals, for round objects and time, for people, for long objects and trees, for canoes, for measures, and for counting when no particular object is being numerated.… .. ..” Here, seven distinct sets of words = not same words, So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 39: The Tsimshian language contains both older and newer systems of counting. Keywords for the question: Tsimshian language, contains, both older and newer systems, counting, After the information about listing seven distinct sets of words for numbers according to the class of item in the Tsimshian language, the author says in lines 6-7, “It seems that the last is a later development while the first six groups show the relics of an older system.” This means the Tsimshian language has both old and new systems for counting. So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 40: Early peoples found it easier to count by using their fingers rather than a group of pebbles. Keywords for the question: early peoples, found, easier, to count, using, fingers, rather than, group of pebbles, In the final paragraph, the author mentions in lines 2-3, “ . .. . it is possible to count by matching the items being counted against a group of pebbles, grains of corn, or the counter’s fingers. .. ..” However, there is no mention regarding whether early people found it easier to count by using their fingers or a group of pebbles.",

Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question no. 1: the location of the first cinema Keywords for the question: location, first cinema, In paragraph A, read these lines carefully, “The Lumière Brothers opened their Cinematographe, at 14 Boulevard des Capucines in Paris, to 100 paying customers over 100 years ago, on December 8, 1985.

So, the answer is: I Question no. 3: the speed with which cinema has changed Keywords for the question: speed, cinema, changed, Skim paragraph J to find how fast cinema has changed, “And it has all happened so quickly. Almost unbelievably, it is a mere 100 years since that train arrived and the audience screamed and fled, convinced by the dangerous reality of what they saw, and, perhaps, suddenly aware that the world could never be the same again -that, maybe, it could be better, brighter, more astonishing, more real than reality.” Here, it is a mere 100 years mean that cinema has progressed very fast during 100 years. So, the answer is: J Question no. 4: how cinema teaches us about other cultures Keywords for the question: how, cinema, teaches, other cultures, The answer can be found in lines 1-6 of paragraph E. The writer says here, “One effect of this realism was to educate the world about itself. For cinema makes the world smaller. Long before people travelled to America or anywhere else, they knew what other places looked like; they knew how other people worked and lived. . .. .. .” Here, they knew what other places looked like; they knew how other people worked and lived = cinema teaches us about other cultures, So, the answer is: E Question no. 5: the attraction of actors in films Keywords for the question: attraction, actors, films, The first lines of paragraph G give us the answer, “The ‘star’ was another natural consequence of cinema.

Keywords for the question: important, understand, how, first audiences, reacted to, cinema, The answer is found in lines 4-9 of paragraph B, “ . .. . But it is worth trying, for to understand the initial shock of those images is to understand the extraordinary power and magic of cinema, the unique, hypnotic quality that has made films the most dynamic, effective art form of the 20th century.” Here, it is worth trying = it is important, the initial shock of those images = how the first audiences reacted to the cinema, So, the answer is: YES Question no. 7: The Lumiere Brothers’ film about the train was one of the greatest films ever made. Keywords for the question: Lumiere Brothers’ film, train, one of, greatest films ever made, Paragraph C gives a detailed explanation of The Lumiere Brothers’ film about the train. Here, these lines may confuse you, “ . .. Yet the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, one of the greatest of all film artists, described the film as a ‘work of genius’.” You need to read the question again; it asks about the film, not the film artists. In this passage, there is no information about whether this film is one of the greatest films ever made or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 8: Cinema presents a biased view of other countries. Keywords for the question: cinema, presents, biased view, other countries, In paragraph E we find the information that cinema can make us aware about other countries.

A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph that will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question no. 14: Key Point Two Take a close look at the first lines of Key Point Two, “The literature on goal-setting theory suggests that managers should ensure that all employees have specific goals and receive comments on how well they are doing in those goals.” Here, all employees have specific goals = establish targets, receive comments on how well they are doing in those goals = give feedbacks, So, the answer is: vii (Establish targets and give feedback) Question no. 15: Key Point Three The answer can be found in lines 1-4 of Key Point Three. Here, the writer says, “Regardless of whether goals are achievable or well within management’s perceptions of the employee’s ability, if employees see them as unachievable they will reduce their effort. Managers must be sure, therefore, that employees feel confident that their efforts can lead to performance goals. .. .. .” Here, if employees see them as unachievable they will reduce their effort = targets should not be unrealistic, So, the answer is: iii (Ensure targets are realistic) Question no. 16: Key Point Four The answer can be found in lines 1-3 of Key Point Four. Take a look at these lines, “Since employees have different needs, what acts as a reinforcement for one may not for another. Managers could use their knowledge of each employee to personalise the rewards over which they have control. .. .. .” Here, personalise the rewards over which they have control = match rewards to individuals, So, the answer is: ii (Match rewards to individuals) Question no. 17: Key Point Five The answer can be found in the very first sentence of Key Point Five. The writer says here, “Managers need to make rewards contingent on performance. . .. .. ” Here, performance = achievement, contingent = reliant/linked, So, the answer is: iv (Link rewards to achievement) Question no. 18: Key Point Six The answer can be found in the first lines of Key Point Six. The author says here, “The way rewards are distributed should be transparent so that employees perceive that rewards or outcomes are equitable and equal to the inputs given. .. ..” Here, The way rewards are distributed = reward system, transparent = fair, So, the answer is: i (Ensure the reward system is fair) Questions 19-24: YES, NO, NOT GIVEN: [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 19: A shrinking organisation tends to lose its less skilled employees rather than its more skilled employees. Keywords for the question: shrinking organisation, tends to lose, less skilled employees, than, more skilled employees, The answer can be found in the ‘THE CHALLENGE’ section in the first paragraph. The writer says here, “. . .. . When an organization is shrinking, the best and most mobile workers are prone to leave voluntarily. …they are the ones….with the highest skills and experience.” Here, the lines clearly suggest that the less skilled workers have a lower chance to lose their jobs than the highly skilled ones. Here, most mobile workers = more skilled workers, So, the answer is: NO Question no. 20: It is easier to manage a small business than a large business. Keywords for the question: easier to manage, small business, than, large business, In ‘KEY POINT ONE’, small and large businesses are mentioned but we do not find any comparison on managing them.

Keywords for the question: staff appraisal process, should be, designed, by employees, ‘KEY POINT THREE’ mentions about ‘staff appraisal process’. Take a look at the last lines, “. .. . For managers, this means that employees must have the capability of doing the job and must regard the appraisal process as valid.” However, it’s not mentioned whether the process should be designed by employees or managers. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 24: Employees’ earnings should be disclosed to everyone within the organisation. Keywords for the question: employees’ earnings, should be disclosed, to everyone, within, organisation, In ‘KEY POINT FIVE’ the writer mentions employees’ earnings. Here, in lines 5-6, the writer says, “ . .. . Eliminating the secrecy surrounding pay by openly communicating everyone’s remuneration, publicising performance bonuses and allocating annual salary increases in a lump sum … .. . . . make rewards more visible and potentially more motivating.” Here, make rewards more visible = should be disclosed to everyone, So, the answer is: YES Questions 25-27: Matching places/names/groups from list of descriptions: [The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the name of the person/places/groups, read around it carefully and try to match with the given list of descriptions. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same person in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions will not follow any sequential order. Do the reverse method when the statements are in questions] Question no. 25: high achievers Keywords for the question: high achievers, We find points made about high achievers in ‘KEY POINT ONE’ where the writer mentions where and why we should select high achievers. Then, in ‘KEY POINT TWO’ in lines 3-4, the writer says, “ . .. . For those with high achievement needs, typically a minority in any organisation, the existence of external goals is less important because high achievers are already internally motivated. .. . .” Here, For those with high achievement needs = high achievers, the existence of external goals is less important = they have less need of external goals. So, the answer is: B (They have less need of external goals.) Question no. 26: clerical workers Keywords for the question: clerical workers, The answer can be found in ‘KEY POINT SIX’ in lines 7-8, “ . . .. the clerical workers considered factors such as quality of work performed and job knowledge near the top of their list, . .. .” Here, quality of work performed = quality of their work, the top of their list = important, So, the answer is: C (They think that the quality of their work is important.) Question no. 27: production workers Keywords for the question: production workers, In ‘KEY POINT SIX’, take a look at line no. 13, “.. .. . For example, production workers rated advancement very highly, . .. ..” Here, advancement = promotion, very highly = to be important, So, the answer is: A (They judge promotion to be important.) Reading Passage 3: Questions 28-40 The headline of the passage: The Search for the Anti-aging Pill Questions 27-32: YES, NO, NOT GIVEN: [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 28: Studies show drugs available today can delay the process of growing old. Keywords for the question: studies show, drugs available today, delay, process, growing old, Take a look at the first sentence of the first paragraph where the writer says, “As researchers on aging noted recently, no treatment on the market today has been proved to slow human aging . .. . .” Here, no treatment = drugs available, slow human aging = delay to process of growing old, So, the answer is: NO Question no. 29: There is scientific evidence that eating fewer calories may extend human life. Keywords for the question: scientific evidence, eating fewer calories, may extend, human life, In the first paragraph, the writer says in lines 3-5, “ . .. . But one intervention, consumption of a low-calorie* yet nutritionally balanced diet, works incredibly well in a broad range of animals, increasing longevity and prolonging good health. … .. .” Here, consumption of a low-calorie .. .. .. balanced diet = eating fewer calories, prolonging good health = may extend human life, So, the answer is: YES Question no. 30: Not many people are likely to find a caloric-restricted diet attractive. Keywords for the question: not many people, likely, find, caloric-restricted diet, attractive, Lines 2-3 of paragraph no. 2 says, “ . .. . . Few mortals could stick to that harsh a regimen, especially for years on end.. . .. .” Here, Few mortals = not many people, that harsh a regimen = calorie-restricted diet, could stick = likely to find . .. attractive, So, the answer is: YES Question no. 31: Diet-related diseases are common in older people. Keywords for the question: diet-related diseases, common, older people, Lines 6-7 talks about some common diet-related diseases, “ . .. . . age-related disorders (such as diabetes, arteriosclerosis, heart disease and cancer) …. . .” However, we don’t find any comment on whether diet-related diseases are common in older people. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 32: In experiments, rats who ate what they wanted, led shorter lives than rats on a low-calorie diet. Keywords for the question: experiments, rats, ate, what they wanted, led, shorter lives, than, low-calorie-diet, Have a look at paragraph no. 3 (in the The benefits of caloric restriction section) where the author talks about the results of the experiment done on rats, “ . .. . they found that rats fed a low-calorie diet lived longer on average than free-feeding rats and also had a reduced incidence of conditions that become increasingly common in old age. .. .. .” Here, rats fed a low-calorie diet lived longer = rats which ate what they wanted did not live longer compared to rats which ate a low-calorie diet, So, the answer is: YES Questions 33-37: Classifying groups [This type of question asks candidates to classify information from the given reading text. Candidates are given some groups from the text, and a list of options, which are listed as A, B, C etc. They must match the correct groups with the correct options.

Keywords for the question: monkeys, less likely, become diabetic, Paragraphs no. 5 and 6 talk about experiments on monkeys. Here, in paragraph no. 6, the writer says in lines 3-4, “The calorie-restricted animals . .. . .. .. .. .. they have more normal blood glucose levels (pointing to a reduced risk for diabetes, which is marked by unusually high blood glucose levels). .. .. ..” Here, pointing to a reduced risk for diabetes = less likely to become diabetic, So, the answer is: A (caloric-restricted monkeys) Question no. 34: Monkeys experienced more chronic disease. Keywords for the question: monkeys, more, chronic disease, The writer says in paragraph no. 6 in lines 4-6, “.. .. … . it has recently been shown that rhesus monkeys kept on caloric-restricted diets for an extended time (nearly 15 years) have less chronic disease. … .. .” The lines suggest that monkeys kept on calorie-restricted diet experienced less chronic disease compared to control monkeys. So, the answer is: B (control monkeys) Question no. 35: Monkeys have been shown to experience a longer than average life span. Keywords for the question: monkeys, shown to experience, longer, than average life span, The writer says in paragraph no. in lines 6-8, “. .. .. They and the other monkeys must be followed still longer, however, to know whether low-calorie intake can increase both average and maximum life spans in monkeys.. .. .. .” Here, must be followed still longer = result is pending, maximum life spans = longer than average life span, So, the answer is: C (neither caloric-restricted monkeys nor control monkeys) Question no. 36: Monkeys enjoyed a reduced chance of heart disease. Keywords for the question: monkeys, enjoyed, reduced chance, heart disease, The answer can be found at the beginning of paragraph no. 6. The writer says here, “The caloric-restricted animals also look better on indicators of risk for age-related diseases. For example, they have lower blood pressure and triglyceride levels (signifying a decreased likelihood of heart disease) . .” Here, a decreased likelihood of heart disease = a reduced chance of heart disease, So, the answer is: A (caloric-restricted monkeys) Question no. 37: Monkeys produced greater quantities of insulin. Keywords for the question: monkeys, produced, greater quantities, insulin, In paragraph no. 5, the author mentions, “. . .. calorie-restricted monkeys have lower body temperatures and levels of the pancreatic hormone insulin. … … .” This means the level of insulin is greater in control monkeys. So, the answer is: B (control monkeys) Questions 38-40: Completing FLOW-CHART with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS: In this type of question, candidates are asked to write NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS to complete some notes on the given flow-chart. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. [TIPS: Here, scanning technique will come in handy. Target the keywords of the questions to find the answers. Remember to focus on Proper nouns, random Capital letters, numbers, special characters of text etc.] Title of the flow-chart: How a calorie-restriction mimetic works All the answers are found in the last section (How a prototype caloric-restriction mimetic works). Question no. 38: CR mimetic ↓ less __________ is processed Keywords for the question: CR mimetic, less, processed, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 8 in lines 2-3. The writer says here, “. . .. calorie restriction minimizes the amount of glucose entering cells and decreases ATP generation. .. . .” Here, minimizes the amount of glucose = less glucose is processed, So, the answer is: glucose Question no. 39 40: production of ATP is decreased Theory 1: Theory 2: cells less damaged by disease because fewer __________ are emitted cells focus on ____________ because food is in short supply Keywords for the question: production of ATP, decreased, Theory 1, cells, damaged, disease, fewer, omitted, Theory 2, cells, focus on, food, short supply, The answers can be found in paragraph no.6. The writer says first in lines 7-9, “. . .. One possibility relates to the ATP-making machinery’s emission of free radicals, which are thought to contribute to aging and to such age-related diseases as cancer by damaging cells. Reduced operation of the machinery should limit their production and thereby constrain the damage… . .” Here, One possibility = theory 1, Reduced operation of the machinery = fewer free radicals are emitted, So, the answer for q. 39 is free radicals. Then, the writer says, “ . .. .. Another hypothesis suggests that decreased processing of glucose could indicate to cells that food is scarce (even if it isn’t) and induce them to shift into an anti-aging mode that emphasizes preservation of the organism over such ‘luxuries’ as growth and reproduction.” Here, Another hypothesis = theory 2, food is scarce = food is in short supply, emphasizes = focus on, So, the answer for q. 40 is preservation. So, the answers are: free radicals preservation",

A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph that will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question no. 1: Paragraph A The last lines of the paragraph talk about what doctors expect from drug companies, “ . .. . ‘The last rep offered me a trip to Florida. What do you have?’ the physician asked. He was only half joking.” Here, The last rep offered me a trip to Florida = the kind of offers the doctors get from drug companies, He was only half joking = He really expects a big offer, So, the answer is: v (An example of what doctors expect from drug companies) Question no. 2: Paragraph B Paragraph B explains the different types of gifts that doctors get from pharmaceutical companies that include financial incentives. Take a look at the phrases and clauses like ‘a pair of tickets for a NY musical’, ‘a car trunk full of promotional gifts and gadgets’, ‘a budget that could buy lunches and dinners for a smell county’, ‘$200’, ‘a few $1000 honoraria to offer’. Here, $200 and $1000 = financial incentives, So, the answer is: vi (Gifts include financial incentives) Question no. 3: Paragraph C Paragraph C mainly raises the question of who is responsible for the promotions offered to the doctors; we find about the salespeople, the doctors or the industry but the writer is not sure who to blame. So, he/she raises the question, “ .. .. so are doctors to blame for the escalating extravagance of pharmaceutical marketing? Or is it the industry’s responsibility to decide the boundaries? Here, refutes = the example directly contradicts the previous statement / Higher incomes need not mean more cars, So, the answer is: iii (Who is responsible for the increase in promotions?) Question no. 4: Paragraph D Paragraph D clearly deals with the advantages of drug promotions as we find statements such as ‘provide much-needed information and education to physicians’ (line 4), ‘primary sources of drug education for healthcare givers’(lines 5-6), ‘salespeople have essentially become specialists in one drug or group of drugs’(lines7-8). So, the answer is: ix (The positive side of drugs promotion) Question no. 5: Paragraph E Take a close look at the last few lines of paragraph E. The writer includes a comment made by a doctor, “ . .. Money well spent? It’s hard to tell. ‘I’ve been the recipient of golf balls from one company and I use them, but it doesn’t make me prescribe their medicine,’ says one doctor. ‘I tend to think I’m not influenced by what they give me.’” Here, not influenced = not . . .. .persuaded, So, the answer is: i (Not all doctors are persuaded) Question no. 6: Paragraph F This paragraph cites research done by the University of Washington and the author provides the result at the end of the paragraph, “ .. .. – the conclusion was that the availability of samples led them to dispense and prescribe drugs that differed from their preferred drug choice.” Here, availability of samples led them to dispense and prescribe drugs = promotion works, So, the answer is: vii (Research shows that promotion works) Question no. 7: Paragraph G The second and third lines of paragraph G give us the answer, “ . .. .. And patients are the ones who pay – in the form of sky-rocketing prescription prices – for every pen that’s handed out, every free theatre ticket, and every steak dinner eaten.” Here, patients are the ones who pay = patients are the real payers, So, the answer is: x (Who really pays for doctors’ free gifts?) Question 8-13: YES, NO, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 8: Sales representatives like Kim Schaefer work to a very limited budget. Keywords for the question: Sales representatives, Kim Schaefer, work, very limited budget, In paragraph B, as we’ve already read for the previous question type, the writer gives a detailed explanation of the types of promotions sales representatives like Kim Schaefer offer to the doctors, “. .. . . a car trunk full of promotional gifts and gadgets, a budget that could buy lunches and dinners for a small country, hundreds of free drug samples and the freedom to give a physician $200 to prescribe her new product to the next six patients who fit the drug’s profile. And she also has a few $ 1,000 honoraria .. .. .. .. .” These lines clearly indicate that sales representatives have a very big budget. So, the answer is: NO Question no. 9: Kim Schaefer’s marketing technique may be open to criticism on moral grounds. Keywords for the question: Kim Schaefer’s marketing technique, open to criticism, moral grounds, The answer can be found in paragraph C where the author mentions in the very beginning, “ .. .. Selling pharmaceuticals is a daily exercise in ethical judgement. .. …” Here, daily exercise = may be open to, ethical judgement = criticism on moral judgement, So, the answer is: YES Question no. 10: The information provided by drug companies is of little use to doctors. Keywords for the question: information, provided by, drug companies, of little use, doctors, The answer to this question can be found in paragraph D, in lines 3-4 “ … . . Salespeople provide much-needed information and education to physicians. .. .. . .” Here, much-needed information and education = information and education is of great use, physicians = doctors, So, the answer is: NO Question no. 11: Evidence of drug promotion is clearly visible in the healthcare environment. Keywords for the question: evidence, drug promotion, clearly visible, healthcare environment, Take a look at these lines paragraph E, “. . .. Rarely do patients watch a doctor write with a pen that isn’t emblazoned with a drug’s name, or see a nurse use a tablet not bearing a pharmaceutical company’s logo. . .. …” The lines mean that patients watch a doctor to write a pen that is emblazoned (marked) with a drug’s name most of the time or see a nurse use a tablet that bears the pharmaceutical company’s logo most of the time. So, the evidence of drug promotion is clearly visible. So, the answer is: YES Question no. 12: The drug companies may give free drug samples to patients without doctors’ prescriptions. Keywords for the question: drug companies, may give, free drug samples, patients, without doctors’ prescriptions, In paragraph F we find about ‘free drug samples’ in the beginning. However, it is not mentioned whether the drug companies may give them to patients without doctors’ prescriptions or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 13: It is legitimate for drug companies to make money. Keywords for the question: legitimate, drug companies, make money, In paragraph G the writer says in lines 4-5, “ . .. . In the end the fact remains that pharmaceutical companies have every right to make a profit . .. .. .” Here, have every right = it is legitimate, make a profit = make money, So, the answer is: YES Reading Passage 2: Questions 14-26 The headline of the passage: Do literate women make better mothers? Questions 14-18: Completing summary with list of words [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete a summary with a list of words taken from the passage. Candidates must write the correct letter (not the words) as the answers. Keywords and synonyms are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Question no. 14: The Nicaraguan National Literacy Crusade aimed to teach large numbers of illiterate ___________ to read and write. Keywords for the question: Nicaraguan National Literacy Crusade, aimed to teach, large numbers of illiterate, read and write, Let’s scan the passage to find the KEYPHRASE ‘Nicaraguan National Literacy Crusade’. Paragraph no. 3 talks about this KEYPHRASE. So, there’s a high possibility to find the answers from here. The writer says here, “In 1979, the government of Nicaragua established a number of social programmes, including a National Literacy Crusade. By 1985, about 300,000 illiterate adults from all over the country, many of whom had never attended primary school, had learnt how to read, write and use numbers.” Here, adults = men and women, So, the answer is: B (men and women) Question no. 15: Public health experts have known for many years that there is a connection between child health and _________. Keywords for the question: Public health experts, known, many years, connection between, child health and, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 1 (this happens rarely as this type of question generally follows a sequence). Anyway, in lines 1-2 the author of the text says, “Children in developing countries are healthier and more likely to survive past the age of five when their mothers can read and write. Experts in public health accepted this idea decades ago, . . . .” Here, when their mothers can read and write = maternal literacy, Experts in public health = Public health experts, accepted this idea decades ago = have known for many years, So, the answer is: F (maternal literacy) Question no. 16: However, it has not previously been known whether these two factors were directly linked or not. This question has been investigated by __________ in Nicaragua. Keywords for the question: not previously been known, two factors, directly linked or not, This question, investigated by, Nicaragua, First, take a look at lines 2-3 of paragraph no. 1, “. . .. . but until now no one has been able to show that a woman’s ability to read in itself improves her children’s chances of survival.” Here, until now no one has been able to show = it has not previously been known, a woman’s ability to read improves her children’s chances of survival = these two factors were directly linked, Then, in paragraph no. 4, the writer mentions about the investigation, “… researchers from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, the Central American Institute of Health in Nicaragua, the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua and the Costa Rican Institute of Health interviewed nearly 3,000 women, some of whom had learnt to read as children, some during the literacy crusade and some who had never learnt at all.” Here, the research institutes are from a number of countries. So, the answer is: C (an international research team) Questions no. 17 18: As a result, factors such as 17. _________ and attitudes to children have been eliminated, and it has been shown that 18. __________ can in itself improve infant health and survival. Keywords for the question: as a result, factors such as, attitudes to children, eliminated, shown that, itself improve, infant health and survival, The answers can be found in paragraph no. 2. First, the writer says in the beginning, “. .. . . the fact that a woman has had an education may simply indicate her family’s wealth or that it values its children more highly. Now a long-term study carried out in Nicaragua has eliminated these factors .. . .. .” Then, the writer says, “. . .. . that teaching reading to poor adult women, who would otherwise have remained illiterate, has a direct effect on their children’s health and survival.” Here, teaching reading to poor adult women = maternal literacy, So, the answers are: J (family wealth) F (maternal literacy) Questions 19-24: YES, NO, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 19: About a thousand of the women interviewed by the researchers had learnt to read when they were children. Keywords for the question: about a thousand, women, interviewed by, researchers, learnt to read, when, children, The mention of women interviewed by researchers can be found in paragraph no. 4. The writer says here, “. . .. . interviewed nearly 3,000 women, some of whom had learnt to read as children, … .” However, the number of women who learnt to read when being children is not mentioned. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 20: Before the National Literacy Crusade, illiterate women had approximately the same levels of infant mortality as those who had learnt to read in primary school. Keywords for the question: Before, National Literacy Crusade, illiterate women, approximately the same levels of infant mortality, as, who had learnt to read, primary school, Have a look at these lines in paragraph no. 5, “ . .. . In the late 1970s, the infant mortality rate for the children of illiterate mothers was around 110 deaths per thousand live births. At this point in their lives, those mothers who later went on to learn to read had a similar level of child mortality (105/1000). For women educated in primary school, however, the infant mortality rate was significantly lower, at 80 per thousand.” So, the lines confirm that the levels of infant mortality were different for illiterate (110 per thousand) and literate women (80 per thousand); they weren’t the same. So, the answer is: NO Question no. 21: Before and after the National Literacy Crusade, the child mortality rate for the illiterate women stayed at about 110 deaths for each thousand live births. Keywords for the question: before and after, National Literacy Crusade, child mortality rate, illiterate women, stayed, about 110 deaths, each thousand live births, To find the answer to this question we have to read from two paragraphs. First, take a look at paragraph no. 5, “ .. . . . . In the late 1970s, the infant mortality rate for the children of illiterate mothers was around 110 deaths per thousand live births. . .. .” Here, In the late 1970s = before, Then, in paragraph no. 6, the author says, “In 1985, after the National Literacy Crusade had ended, .. .. .. the infant mortality figures for those who remained illiterate and for those educated in primary school remained more or less unchanged.” Here, remained more or less unchanged = stayed at about 110 deaths for each thousand live births, The lines are a clear match to the question. So, the answer is: YES Question no. 22: The women who had learnt to read through the National Literacy Crusade showed the greatest change in infant mortality levels. Keywords for the question: women, had learnt to read, through National Literacy Crusade, showed, greatest change, infant mortality levels, Take a look at lines 3-5 of paragraph no.6, “ . .. . . For those women who learnt to read through the campaign, the infant mortality rate was 84 per thousand, an impressive 21 points lower than for those women who were still illiterate. … .. .” This is a clear match with the question as literate women showed a great decreasing change of 21 points in infant mortality rate. So, the answer is: YES Question no. 23: The women who had learnt to read through the National Literacy Crusade had the lowest rates of child mortality. Keywords for the question: women, who, learnt to read, through, National Literacy Crusade, had, lowest rates, child mortality, In the sixth paragraph, the writer says, “ . .. .For those women who learnt to read through the campaign, the infant mortality rate was 84 per thousand . .. . ” Again, in the fifth paragraph, the writer says that the rate before the Crusade was ‘80 per thousand’ for women educated in primary school. Then, in the sixth paragraph, the writer says that it “remained more or less unchanged”. So, it can be understood from those points that the women who got educated in primary school had the lower rates of child mortality than who had learnt to read through the National Literacy Crusade. Therefore, the question contradicts the information in the passage. So, the answer is: NO Question no. 24: After the National Literacy Crusade, the children of the women who remained illiterate were found to be severely malnourished. Keywords for the question: After, National Literacy Crusade, children of the women, remained illiterate, found, severely malnourished, In the last line of paragraph no.6 the writer mentions, “ . .. . . . The children of the newly-literate mothers were also better nourished than those of women who could not read.” However, we find no information which indicates that those children were severely malnourished. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Questions 25-26: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers for previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question no. 25 26: Which TWO important implications drawn from the Nicaraguan study are mentioned by the writer of the passage? Keywords for the question: TWO, important implications, drawn from, Nicaraguan study, mentioned, by the writer, A. It is better to educate mature women than young girls. B. Similar campaigns in other countries would be equally successful. C. The effects of maternal literacy programmes can be seen very quickly. D. Improving child health can quickly affect a country’s economy. E. Money spent on female education will improve child health. Let’s have a look at paragraphs no. 8, 9 and 10 as they talk about the Nicaraguan study. In paragraph no. 8, the writer says in lines 2-4, “ . .. . there is increasing evidence that female education, at any age, is “an important health intervention in its own right’.” So, women of all ages can be educated. Therefore, option A is wrong. In paragraph no. 10, in the beginning, the writer says, “Cleland warns that the Nicaraguan crusade was special in many ways, and similar campaigns elsewhere might not work as well.” Therefore, option B is wrong. In paragraph no. 9, the writer says, “We’ve known for a long time that maternal education is important,’ says John Cleland of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ‘But we thought that even if we started educating girls today, we’d have to wait a generation for the pay off. The Nicaraguan study suggests we may be able to bypass that.” Here, we may be able to bypass that = the effects of maternal literacy programmes can be seen really soon. Therefore, option C is correct. In paragraph no. 8 the writer says in the end, “ .. . .. The results of the study lend support to the World Bank’s recommendation that education budgets in developing countries should be increased, not just to help their economies, but also to improve child health.” There is no information about the link between improving child health and a country’s economy. Therefore, option D is wrong and option E is correct. So, the answers are: (in either order) C (The effects of maternal literacy programmes can be seen very quickly.) E (Money spent on female education will improve child health.) Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40 The passage is untitled Questions 27-30: List of headings: [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections.

Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph that will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question no. 27: Section A In Section A the writer mentions the survey he conducted in lines 3-5, “ . .. .. A survey I conducted with Irene Whitney found that in British primary schools up to a quarter of pupils reported experience of bullying, which in about one in ten cases was persistent. … . .” Here, A survey = research, a quarter of pupils reported experience of bullying, which in about one in ten cases was persistent = how common bullying is, So, the answer is: iv (Research into how common bullying is in British schools) Question no. 28: Section B Section B highlights the effect of bullying on children. Take a look at lines 1-3, “ . .. . Bullying is clearly unpleasant, and can make the child experiencing it feel unworthy and depressed. In extreme cases it can even lead to suicide, though this is thankfully rare. .. . . …” Here, unpleasant, feel unworthy and depressed it can even lead to suicide = effect of bullying on the children involved, So, the answer is: vi (The effect of bullying on the children involved) Question no. 29: Section C For this question, we have to skim the whole section and we will find the reactions from schools to enquiries about bullying. Take a look at these lines, ‘schools would often deny the problem’, ‘There is no bullying at this school’ has been a common refrain’, ‘There is not much bullying here, but when it occurs we have a clear policy for dealing with it’. So, the answer is: v (The reaction from schools to enquiries about bullying)f Question no. 30: Section D This particular section starts with this line, “Three factors are involved in this change.” Here, this change = developments that have led to a new approach, If we scan the lines, we find the factors being “an awareness of the severity of the problem”, “a number of resources to help tackle bullying” and “evidence that these materials work and that schools can achieve something”. So, the answer is: vii (Developments that have led to a new approach by schools) Questions 31-34: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question no. 31: A recent survey found that in British secondary schools – Keywords for the question: recent survey, British secondary schools, The writer says at the end of section A, “A Survey I conducted . .. . . .. . . . There was less bullying in secondary schools, with about one in twenty-five suffering persistent bullying, but these cases may be particularly recalcitrant.” So, the answer is: B (there was less bullying than in primary schools.) Question no. 32: Children who are bullied – Keywords for the question: children, bullied, In paragraph B, take a look at lines 3-5, “. .. . Victimised pupils are more likely to experience difficulties with interpersonal relationships as adults, .. .. .” Here, experience difficulties with interpersonal relationship = difficulty forming relationship, adults = later life, So, the answer is: D (may have difficulty forming relationships in later life.) Question no. 33: The writer thinks that the declaration ‘There is no bullying at this school’ – Keywords for the question: writer thinks, declaration, ‘There is no bullying at this school’, The answer can be found in the beginning of paragraph C. The writer says here, “ .. . .. and little help was available to teachers to deal with bullying. Perhaps as a consequence, schools would often deny the problem. ‘There is no bullying at this school’ has been a common refrain, almost certainly untrue.. .. .” Here, little help was available = lack of knowledge and resources, So, the answer is: D (reflected a lack of knowledge and resources.) Question no. 34: What were the findings of research carried out in Norway? Keywords for the question: findings, research, carried out in Norway, The writer says in paragraph C in lines 10-12, “. .. .. In Norway, after an intervention campaign was introduced nationally, an evaluation of forty-two schools suggested that, over a two-year period, bullying was halved.. .. .. .” Here, was halved = declined by 50%, So, the answer is: A (Bullying declined by 50% after an anti-bullying campaign.) Questions 35-39: Summary completion: [In this kind of question candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps.] Question no. 35: The most important step is for the school authorities to produce a ________ which makes the school’s attitude towards bullying quite clear. Keywords for the question: most important step, for, school authorities, produce, makes, school’s attitude, towards, bullying, quite clear, The answer can be found at the beginning of paragraph E. The writer says here, “Evidence suggests that a key step is to develop a policy on bullying, saying clearly what is meant by bullying,. . .” Here, a key step = the most important step, to develop = to produce, saying clearly = makes. . .. . ..attitude towards bullying quite clear, So, the answer is: policy Question no. 36: It should include detailed _________ as to how the school and its staff will react if bullying occurs.

The writer says here, “. . .. and giving explicit guidelines on what will be done if it occurs, what records will be kept, who will be informed, what sanctions will be employed, . .” Here, what will be done if it occurs = how the school and its staff will react if bullying occurs, So, the answer is: (explicit) guidelines Question no. 37: In addition, action can be taken through the ___________. This is particularly useful in the early part of the process, as a way of raising awareness and encouraging discussion. On its own, however, it is insufficient to bring about a permanent solution. Keywords for the question: in addition, action, can be taken, through, particularly, useful, if, early part, process, as a way, raising awareness, and encouraging discussion, however, insufficient, bring about, permanent solution, In the second paragraph of section E, the author mentions, “Other actions can be taken to back up the policy. There are ways of dealing with the topic through the curriculum, using video, drama and literature. These are useful for raising awareness, and can best be tied in to early phases of development, while the school is starting to discuss the issue of bullying… .” Here, Other actions can be taken = In addition, action can be taken, useful for raising awareness = a way of raising awareness, So, the answer is: (school) curriculum Question no. 38: Effective work can also be done with individual pupils and small groups. For example, potential ___________of bullying can be trained to be more self-confident. Or again, in dealing with group bullying, a ‘no blame’ approach, which avoids confronting the offender too directly, is often effective. Keywords for the question: effective work, individual pupils, small groups, potential, bullying, trained, more self-confident, dealing, group bullying, ‘no blame’ approach, avoids, confronting, offender, too directly, often effective, The answer can be found in the third paragraph in section E. The writer says here, “. . .. There are also ways of working with individual pupils, or in small groups. Assertiveness training for pupils who are liable to be victims is worthwhile, . .” Here, There are also ways of working = Effective work can also be done, liable to be = potential, Assertiveness training = can be trained to be more self-confident, So, the answer is: victims Question no. 39: Playground supervision will be more effective if members of staff are trained to recognise the difference between bullying and mere ___________. Keywords for the question: playground supervision, more effective, if, members of staff, trained, recognise, difference, between bullying, In section E, take a look at paragraph no. 4 where the author mentions, “ . .. One helpful step is to train lunchtime supervisors to distinguish bullying from playful fighting, and help them break up conflicts. Here, supervisors to distinguish = members of staff are trained to recognise the difference, So, the answer is: playful fighting Question no. 40: Multiple choice questions (choosing a title for the passage) [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question no. 40: Which of the following is the most suitable title for Reading Passage 3? Keywords for the question: most suitable title, If we study the subheading closely, we can find the main idea of the passage which is ‘How can it (bullying) be prevented?’ In this passage, the writer first discusses the problem of persistent bullying in British Education institutions and then proposes some preventive measures.

Keywords for the question: only two, Japanese pagodas, collapsed, 1400 years, In paragraph no. 1, the author says in lines 2-3, “ . .. . Records show that only two have collapsed during the past 1400 years.” The sentence is a clear match with the statement in the question. So, the answer is: YES Question 2: The Hanshin earthquake of 1995 destroyed the pagoda at the Toji temple. Keywords for the question: Hanshin earthquake, 1995, destroyed, pagoda, Toji temple, In paragraph no. 1, the author says in lines 4-7, “The disastrous Hanshin earthquake in1995 killed 6,400 people . . .. .. . Yet it left the magnificent five-storey pagoda at the Toji temple in nearby Kyoto unscathed, though . ..” These liens suggest that the Hanshin earthquake did not destroy the pagoda at the Toji temple. Here, unscathed = unharmed, untouched, So, the lines contradict the statement made in the question. So, the answer is: NO Question 3: The other buildings near the Toji pagoda had been built in the last 30 years. Keywords for the question: other buildings, near, Toji temple, built, last 30 years, Only paragraph no. 1 talks about the making of the Toji temple. However, in this passage we cannot find any information that gives us idea whether other buildings near Toji temple were built in the last 30 years or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 4: The builders of pagodas knew how to absorb some of the power produced by severe weather conditions. Keywords for the question: builders, knew, how to absorb, some of the power, produced by, severe weather conditions, Moving to paragraph no. 4 we find information about the builders’ knowledge about designing pagodas. Here, in lines 4-8, the author says, “When the pagoda reached Japan, however, its architecture was freely adapted to local conditions – they were built less high, typically five rather than nine storeys, made mainly of wood and the staircase was dispensed with because the Japanese pagoda did not have any practical use but became more of an art object. Because of the typhoons that batter Japan in the summer, Japanese builders learned to extend the eaves of buildings further beyond the walls.” Here, typhoons = severe weather conditions, Japanese builders learned to extend the eaves of buildings further beyond the walls = The builders of pagodas knew how to absorb some of the power, So, the answer is: YES Questions 5-10: (Classifying statements) [This type of question asks candidates to classify information from the given reading text. Candidates are given some statements from the text, and a list of options, which are listed as A, B, C etc. They must match the correct statements with the correct options. N.B.: This question doesn’t follow any sequence. So, they should be answered after all other questions in the passage.] Question 5: easy interior access to top Keywords for the question: easy interior access, top, In paragraph no. 4, lines 4-7 talk about the difference between Chinese and Japanese pagoda designs, “The Chinese built their pagodas in brick or stone, with inner staircases, and used them in later centuries mainly as watchtowers. When the pagoda reached Japan, however, its architecture was freely adapted to local conditions – they were built less high, typically five rather than nine storeys, made mainly of wood and the staircase was dispensed with because the Japanese pagoda did not have any practical use but became more of an art object.” The lines suggest that Chinese pagodas had inner staircases for easy access to top. However, Japanese pagodas had no staircases because they did not have any practical use of staircases. So, the answer is: B (only Chinese pagodas) Question 6: tiles on eaves Keywords for the question: tiles, eaves, In the last sentence of paragraph no. 5, the writer mentions: “For the same reason, the builders of Japanese pagodas seem to have further increased their weight by choosing to cover these extended eaves not with the porcelain tiles of many Chinese pagodas but with much heavier earthenware tiles.” So, both Chinese and Japanese pagodas use tiles on eaves, but they are different in styles. So, the answer is: A (both Chinese and Japanese pagodas) Question 7: use as observation post Keywords for the question: used, observation post, In paragraph no. 4, the writer says in lines 2-4, “.. . . The Chinese built their pagodas . . .. . … and used them in later centuries as watchtowers.” Here, watchtowers = observation post, However, no Japanese pagodas are or were used as watchtowers. So, the answer is: B (only Chinese pagodas) Question 8: size of eaves up to half the width of the building Keywords for the question: size of eaves, up to, half the width, In paragraph no. 5 lines 1-2, the writer says, “The roof of a Japanese temple building can be made to overhang the sides of the structure by fifty per cent or more of the building’s overall width.” In the description of Chinese pagodas, we do not find this about the size of eaves (roof-top). Here, fifty per cent or more = up to half the width, So, the answer is: C (only Japanese pagodas) Question 9: original religious purpose Keywords for the question: original, religious, purpose, At the beginning of paragraph no. 4 the writer states, “The multi-storey pagoda came to Japan from China in the sixth century. As in China, they were first introduced with Buddhism and were attached to important temples.” Here, As in China = just like in China, This means multi-storey pagoda has the original purpose of Buddhism in Japan as in China. So, the answer is: A (both Chinese and Japanese pagodas) Question 10: floors fitting loosely over each other Keywords for the question: floors, fitting, loosely, over, each other, Take a look at paragraph no. 7; this paragraph talks about the design of Japanese Pagoda’s central pillar known as shinbashira. Here, in lines 8-10, the author says, “ .. . What those early craftsmen had found by trial and error was that under pressure a pagoda’s loose stack of floors could be made to slither to and fro independent of one another.” Here, loose stack of floors = floors fitting loosely over each other, In the description of Chinese Pagodas, we do not find such conditions on floors. So, the answer is: C (only Japanese pagodas) Questions 11-13: (Multiple choice questions) [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question 11: In a Japanese pagoda, the shinbashira – Keywords for the question: Japanese pagoda, shinbashira, We find the details about shinbashira in paragraph no. 6 and 7. In paragraph no. 6, the writer says, “Is the answer that, like a tall pine tree, the Japanese pagoda – with its massive trunk-like central pillar known as shinbashira – simply flexes and sways during a typhoon or earthquake? For centuries, many thought so. But the answer is not so simple because the startling thing is that the shinbashira actually carries no load at all. In fact, in some pagoda designs, it does not even rest on the ground,. . .. .” Here, carries no load at all and in some pagoda designs, it does not even rest on the ground mean that options A, B, and C are not correct. Then, in paragraph no. 7, the writer says, “.. . The shinbashira, running up through a hole in the centre of the building, constrained individual storeys from moving too far… ..” Here, constrained individual storeys from moving too far = stops the floors moving too far, So, the answer is: D (stops the floors moving too far.) Question 12: Shuzo Ishida performs experiments in order to – Keywords for the question: Shuzo Ishida, performs, experiments, to, In paragraph no. 7, the writer mentions about Shuzo Ishida in lines 3-5, “Mr Ishida, known to his students as ‘Professor Pagoda’ because of his passion to understand the pagoda, has built a series of models and tested them on a ‘shake-table’ in his laboratory.” Therefore, this can be understood from the lines that the reason for the experiment is to understand the pagoda. We can gather that the possible answers are: C. learn about the dynamics of pagodas Or, D. understand ancient mathematics. Then, in lines 5-6 of the same paragraph, the writer says, “The ancient craftsmen, apparently without the assistance of very advanced mathematics… . .. . ” Therefore, it is clear that no ‘ancient mathematics’ was involved here. So, option D is not correct. So, the answer is: C (learn about the dynamics of pagodas.) Question 13: The storeys of a Japanese pagoda are – Keywords for the question: storeys, Japanese pagoda, The answer will be option C because we’ve already found it question no. 10. Take a look at paragraph no. 7; this paragraph talks about the design of Japanese Pagoda’s central pillar known as shinbashira. Here, in lines 8-10, the author says, “ .. . What those early craftsmen had found by trial and error was that under pressure a pagoda’s loose stack of floors could be made to slither to and fro independent of one another.” Here, loose stack of floors = floors fitting loosely over each other, So, the answer is: C (fitted loosely on top of each other.) Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: The True Cost of Food Questions 14-17 (Identifying information): [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 14: a cost involved in purifying domestic water Keywords for this question: cost, purifying, domestic water, Here, ‘cost’ means the amount of money spent on something. We can use a short technique here. Let’s find out some symbols such as $, £ or € that indicate ‘cost’. If you scan the passage for these symbols, we can find out that paragraphs D and E contain the ‘$’ symbol. Now, we need to scan the information around the symbol and look for something that indicates ‘the purification of water’. In paragraph E, take a look at these lines, “ . . . . £23m for the removal of the bug Cryptosporidium from drinking water by water companies; . . . .” Here, the removal of the bug . . .. from drinking water = purifying domestic water, So, the answer is: E Question 15: the stages in the development of the farming industry Keywords for this question: stages, development, farming industry, The keyword here is ‘the stages’ which means we need to look for some linkers indicating ‘process’ such as First, Then, Next, After that etc. In paragraph B, the writer says at the beginning, “First mechanisation, then mass use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, then monocultures, then battery rearing of livestock, and now genetic engineering – the onward march of intensive farming has seemed unstoppable in the last half-century, as the yields of produce have soared.” The linkers indicate that the development of the farming industry started with mechanisation; then came the mass use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides and after that came monocultures. Next, it was battery rearing of livestock and presently it is genetic engineering. So, the answer is: B Question 16: the term used to describe hidden costs Keywords for this question: term, describe, hidden costs, Here, we need to look for the term – word or phrase – that describes ‘hidden cost’. Looking at paragraph C, we can find out the following sentences, “.. . . That is mainly because the costs of all this damage are what economists refer to as externalities: they are outside the main transaction …. . .” Therefore, we can see that the term ‘externalities’ means the extra cost (they are outside the main transaction). So, the answer is: C Question 17: one effect of chemicals on water sources Keywords for this question: effect, chemicals, water sources, In paragraph B, take a look at the last lines, “. .. … Natural soil fertility is dropping in many areas because of continuous industrial fertiliser and pesticide use, while the growth of algae is increasing in lakes because of the fertiliser run-off.” Here, industrial fertiliser and pesticide = chemicals, the growth of algae is increasing = one effect, So, the answer is: B Questions 18-21 (YES, NO, NOT GIVEN) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN] [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 18: Several species of wildlife in the British countryside are declining. Keywords for this question: several species, wildlife, British countryside, declining, We can find the answer in paragraph B, take a close look at lines 4-7, “ . .. . But the damage it has caused has been colossal. In Britain, for example, many of our best-loved farmland birds, such as the skylark, the grey partridge, the lapwing and the corn bunting, have vanished from huge stretches of countryside, as have even more wild flowers and insects. Here, have vanished = declining, So, the answer is: YES Question 19: The taste of food has deteriorated in recent years. Keywords for this question: taste of food, deteriorated, recent years, There is a reference to the cost of food in recent years is found in paragraph A. However, no reference to the quality of food, especially the taste is found in this passage. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 20: The financial costs of environmental damage are widely recognised. Keywords for this question: financial costs, environmental damage, widely recognised, In paragraph C, in line no. 2, the author talks about the financial costs or environmental damage, “. . .. That is mainly because the costs of all this damage . . . .” Then, in lines 5-6, the writer says, “ . .. . . To many, the costs may not even appear to be financial at all, but merely aesthetic- a terrible shame, but nothing to do with money.” These lines suggest that many people may not recognise these costs as financial at all. So, the answer is: NO Question 21: One of the costs calculated by Professor Pretty was illness caused by food. Keywords for this question: one, costs calculated, Professor Pretty, illness, caused by food, Paragraph E gives the detailed costs calculated by Professor Pretty. In line no. 6, the author mentions one of the calculations, “… £169m from food poisoning; … . .” Here, food poisoning = illness caused by food, So, the answer is: YES Questions 22-26 (Completing summary with NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete a summary using information from the passage with NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS. Keywords and synonyms are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Question 22: Professor Pretty concludes that our __________ are higher than most people realise, because we make three different types of payment. Keywords for this question: Professor Pretty, concludes, higher than, most people realise, because, make three, types, payment, Let’s have a look at paragraph E. Here the writer says in lines 6-11, “Professor Pretty draws a simple but memorable conclusion from all this: our food bills are actually threefold. We are paying for our supposedly cheaper food in three separate ways: once over the counter, secondly through our taxes which provide the enormous subsidies propping up modern intensive farming, and thirdly to clean up the mess that modern farming leaves behind.” Here, higher corresponds to threefold = three times as much/ triple, conclude = draw a conclusion, three different types= three separate ways, make payment = paying for, over the counter = in the shops, So, the answer is: food bills / food costs Question 23: He feels it is realistic to suggest that Britain should reduce its reliance on _________. Keywords for this question: feels, realistic, suggest, Britain, should reduce, reliance on, In paragraph F, the writer states in lines 1-4, “Breaking away from industrial agriculture as the solution to hunger may be very hard for some countries, but in Britain, where the immediate need to supply food is less urgent, and the costs and the damage of intensive farming have been clearly seen, it may be more feasible.” Here, These lines indicate that Professor Pretty shows the attitude that breaking away from industrial agriculture is possible (realistic) though it may be very hard. This is because the need for food in Britain is not so urgent. However, the damage done by intensive farming has been more apparent. So, the answer is: (modern) intensive farming / agriculture Question 24: Although most farmers would be unable to adapt to __________. Keywords for this question: Although, most farmers, unable to adapt, Let’s have a look at paragraph G where the writer says in lines 2-3, “.. .. . Professor Pretty feels that organic farming would be too big a jump in thinking and in practices for many farmers.” Here, would be too big a jump in thinking and in practices = would be unable to adapt So, the answer is: organic farming Question 25: Professor Pretty wants the government to initiate change by establishing what he refers to as a ___________. Keywords for this question: Professor Pretty, wants, government, initiate change, establishing, refers to as, Again in paragraph G, the author states in lines 4-7, “.. . He is recommending the immediate introduction of a ‘Greener Food Standard’, which would push the market towards more sustainable environmental practices than the current norm, while not requiring the full commitment to organic production.” Therefore, the lines indicate that Professor Pretty wants the government to start making change by introducing (establishing) Greener Food Standard. So, the answer is: Greener Food Standard Question 26: He feels this would help to change the attitudes of both __________ and ___________. Keywords for this question: feels, would help, change, attitudes, both, In paragraph G, the writer says in the last lines, “… .. . It could go a long way, he says, to shifting consumers as well as farmers towards a more sustainable system of agriculture.” Here, shifting = change, a more sustainable system of agriculture = the attitudes… changed, So, the answer is: (in either order) farmers, consumers, Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: Makete Integrated Rural Transport Project Questions 27-30: (List of headings): [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph that will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence. ] Question 27: Section B Section B contains two paragraphs. In paragraph no. 1, the existing communication situation of Makete district has been explained which shows the need for an integrated transport system. Then paragraph no. 2 starts with these lines, “Before solutions could be proposed, the problems had to be understood. Little was known about the transport demands of the rural households, so Phase I, between December 1985 and December 1987, focused on research.” Here, the problems had to be understood = the problems had to understood/ identified, So, the answer is: ii (Identifying the main transport problems) Question 28: Section C Section C contains four paragraphs which mostly talk about the primary solutions to the problems related to building a proper transport system. Take a look at paragraph no. 1 where the writer states, “Having determined the main transport needs, possible solutions were identified which might reduce the time and burden. During Phase II, from January to February 1991, a number of approaches were implemented in an effort to improve mobility and access to transport.” Here, possible solutions were identified = initial solutions had been identified, Then, in the following paragraphs, the writer describes the initial improvements that came about. So, the answer is: v (Initial improvements in mobility and transport modes) Question 29: Section E Section E contains one paragraph only. In the last lines of section E the writer says, “….. . . It would have been difficult to respond to the requests of villagers and other rural inhabitants without the support and understanding of district authorities.” Here, district authorities = district officials, This means the project became a success because villagers and other rural inhabitants got support (co-operation) from district officials. So, the answer is: x (Co-operation of district officials) Question 30: Section F Section F contains two small paragraphs. The first paragraph explains how important this MIRTP has been for the rural people of Makete district of south-western Tanzania. Then, in the last lines of the final paragraph, the author explains, “. . . The experiences from Makete will help in this initiative, and Makete District will act as a reference for future work.” Here, will act as a reference for future work = as a future model, So, the answer is: i (MIRTP as a future model) Questions 31-35: (YES, NO, NOT GIVEN) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN] [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 31: MIRTP was divided into five phases. Keywords for this question: MIRTP, divided into, five phases, If we skim all the sections of the passages, we can find only three phases in MIRTP. Phase I is mentioned in Section B (line no. 6). Phase II is mentioned in Section C (line no. 2). Phase III is mentioned in Section D (line no. 2). So, the answer is: NO Question 32: Prior to the start of MIRTP, the Makete district was almost inaccessible during the rainy season. Keywords for this question: prior to, start, MIRTP, Makete district, almost inaccessible, rainy season, Take a close look at section B. In the first sentence the author states, “When the project began, Makete District was virtually totally isolated during the rainy season.” Here, virtually totally isolated = almost inaccessible, So, the answer is: YES Question 33: Phase I of MIRTP consisted of a survey of household expenditure on transport. Keywords for this question: Phase I, MIRTP, consisted of, survey, household expenditure, on transport, The reference of the survey in Phase I is given in section B, paragraph no. 2. Here, in lines 3-4, the author mentions, “. .. . The socio-economic survey of more than 400 households in the district indicated that a household in Makete spent, on average, seven hours a day on transporting themselves and their goods, .. .. ..” Therefore, the statement is a clear indication that the survey was on the time spent transporting the people of Makete and their goods, not on household expenditure on transport. So, the answer is: NO Question 34: The survey concluded that one-fifth or 20% of the household transport requirement as outside the local area. Keywords for this question: survey, concluded, one-fifth, 20%, household transport requirement, outside the local area, In the last lines of section B paragraph no. 2, the author writes, “.. .. .. Interesting facts regarding transport were found: 95% was on foot; 80% was within the locality; and 70% was related to the collection of water and firewood and travelling to grinding mills.” Here, 80% was within the locality = 20% was outside the locality, So, the answer is: YES Question 35: MIRTP hoped to improve the movement of goods from Makete district to the country’s capital. Keywords for this question: MIRTP, hoped to, improved, movement of goods, Makete, country’s capital, At first glance, it may seem that the answer might be in Section C. However, in section C, the author says in the second paragraph, “However the difference from the conventional approach was that this time consideration was given to local transport needs outside the road network.” The lines show the purpose of the MIRTP which is to make transportation of goods riskless and safer by improving the roads. However, there is no mention of hoping to improve to movement of goods from Makete to the capital of Tanzania, Dodoma. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Questions 36-39 (Completing sentences with correct endings) [For this type of question, candidates need to match the beginning and ending of sentences. Candidates need to look for keywords in the sentence-beginnings and find the relative paragraphs and then sentences in the passage. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question 36: Construction of footbridges, steps and handrails – Keywords for this question: construction, footbridges, steps, handrails, In section C, the author says in paragraph no. 3, “Most goods were transported along the paths that provide short-cuts up and down the hillsides, but the paths were a real safety risk and made the journey on foot even more arduous. It made sense to improve the paths by building steps, handrails and footbridges.” Therefore, the sentences indicate that by constructing footbridges, steps and handrails, transportation up and down hillsides became easier using the improved paths. So, the answer is: D (improved paths used for transport up and down hillsides.) Question 37: Frequent breakdown of buses and trucks in Makete – Keywords for this question: frequent, breakdown, buses and trucks, Have a close look and Section D paragraph no. 4 where you will find the keywords ‘breakdown’ and ‘buses and trucks’. In lines 1-2 the writer mentions, “The efforts to improve the efficiency of the existing transport services were not very successful because most of the motorised vehicles in the district broke down and there were no resources to repair them.” Here, were not very successful means the breaking down of vehicles hindered/hampered the attempts to make the prevailing transport services more efficient. So, the answer is: I (hindered attempts to make the existing transport services more efficient.) Question 38: The improvement of secondary roads and paths – Keywords for this question: improvement, secondary roads, paths, In section D, in paragraph no. 3, the author says, “Paths and secondary roads were improved only at the request of communities who were willing to participate in construction and maintenance.” Here, willing to participate in construction and maintenance = willing to lend a hand / willing to co-operate. So, the answer is: G (was done only at the request of local people who were willing to lend a hand.) Question 39: The isolation of Makete for part of the year – Keywords for this question: isolation, Makete, for part of the year, In section D, paragraph no. 2, the writer says, “The road improvements and accompanying maintenance system had helped make the district centre accessible throughout the year.” The lines suggest that road improvements have made it possible to access Makete in particular months of the year. So, it was no problem to go to Makete during the rainy season, thanks to the road improvements. So, the answer is: E (was no longer a problem once the roads had been improved.) Question 40: Multiple choice questions (Identifying the main purpose/aim of the passage) [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options that shows the main aim/purpose using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Which of the following phrases best describes the main aim of Reading Passage? Keywords for this question: best describes, the main aim, Having a look at the different sections of the passage for all the questions (27-39), it is clear that the passage talks about Makete Integrated Rural Transport Project or MIRTP. The sections deal with the history behind the projects, the problems related to successfully execute the project, the importance of road improvements for Makete and the successful implementation and outcomes of the projects. Therefore, the main aim of the passage is to show how MIRTP was implemented and how successful it was to change the lifestyle of the people of Makete. So, the answer is: B (to describe how MIRTP was implemented and how successful it was)",

Keywords for the question: ants use, same channels of communication, as humans, At the beginning of paragraph no. 2 the writer says, “Ant store food, repel attackers and use chemical signals to contact one another in case of attack. Such chemical communication can be compared to the human use of visual and auditory channels (as in religious chants, advertising images and jingles, political slogans and martial music) to arouse and propagate moods and attitudes.” This means ants use chemical signals while humans use visual and auditory channels which are not similar but they can be compared. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 2: City life is one factor that encourages the development of intelligence. Keywords for the question: city life, factor, encourages, development of intelligence, In paragraph no. 7, the writer mentions about the impact of city life in developing intelligence, “Whereas prehistoric man had no exposure to urban lifestyles – the forcing house of intelligence – the evidence suggests that ants have lived in urban settings for close on a hundred million years … . . . .” Here, urban lifestyles = city life, the forcing house = factor that encourages the development, So, the answer is: TRUE Question 3: Ants can build large cities more quickly than humans do. Keywords for the question: ants, can build, large cities, more quickly, than humans, In paragraphs no. 7 and 8, the author talks about building cities by ants and humans. However, there is no comparison on whether ants build large cities more quickly than humans or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 4: Some ants can find their way by making calculations based on distance and position. Keywords for the question: some ants, find, way, making calculations, based on, distance, position, In paragraph no. 11, the author mentions in lines 1-6, “Research conducted at Oxford, Sussex and Zurich Universities has shown that when desert ants return from a foraging trip, they navigate by integrating bearings and distances, which they continuously update in their heads.” Here, navigate = find their way, integrating = assimilate/making calculations, bearings and distances = distance and position, So, the answer is: TRUE Question 5: In one experiment, foraging teams were able to use their sense of smell to find food. Keywords for the question: one experiment, foraging teams, able to use, sense of smell, find food, In paragraph no. 12, we can find the mention of ‘the experiment’. Here, in lines 11-12, the writer mentions, “. . . Elaborate precautions were taken to prevent the foraging team using odour clues.” The line suggests that necessary actions were taken before to stop the foraging team to use odour (sense of smell). So, the answer is: FALSE Question 6: The essay, ‘In the company of ants’, explores ant communication. Keywords for the question: essay, In the company of ants, explores, ant communication, The last paragraph gives reference to the essay ‘In the company of ants’. The writer says here, in lines 5-9, “It’s no surprise that Edward Wilson, in his essay, ‘In the company of ants’, advises readers who ask what to do with the ants in their kitchen to: ‘Watch where you step. Be careful of little lives.’” Here, the writer of the essay ‘In the company of ants’ advises us to be careful and not to step on the little creatures. However, the line doesn’t indicate anything about the subject of the essay. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Questions 7-13: (Summary completion with list of words) (In this kind of questions candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions form a list of words given in a box. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps and write the correct letter corresponding to the answer.) The title of the summary: Ants as farmers All the answers are found in paragraph D. Question 7: Ants have sophisticated methods of farming, including herding livestock and growing crops, which are in many ways similar to those used in human agriculture. The ants cultivate a large number of different species of edible fungi which convert ________ into a form which they can digest. Keywords for the question: sophisticated methods of farming, herding livestock, growing crops, similar, human agriculture, cultivate, large number, different species, edible fungi, convert, can digest, In paragraph no. 5, the author states in lines 2-6, “Ants can’t digest the cellulose in leaves- but some fungi can. The ants, therefore, cultivate these fungi in their nests, bringing them leaves to feed on, and then use them as a source of food.” So, the answer is: C (cellulose) Questions 8 and 9: They use their own natural 8. ___________ as weed-killers and also use unwanted materials as 9. _________. Keywords for the question: use, own, natural, weed-killers, unwanted materials, Again, in paragraph no. 5, in lines 6-9, the author says, “ . .. Farmer ants secrete antibiotics to control other fungi that might act as ‘weeds’, and spread waste to fertilise the crop.” Here, to control other fungi that might act as ‘weeds’ means weed killers, unwanted materials = waste, Now, the word ‘use’ before question no. 8 and the word ‘spread’ before question no. 9 restrict us to use the word ‘secrete’ and ‘fertilise’, because they don’t fit here grammatically. So, the answers are: M (secretions) F (fertilizers) Question 10: Genetic analysis shows they constantly upgrade these fungi by developing new species and by ________ species with neighbouring ant colonies. Keywords for the question: genetic analysis, constantly upgrade, fungi, developing, new species, neighbouring ant colonies, In paragraph no. 6 line no. 6 we find the word ‘genetically’ that matches with keywords ‘genetic analysis’. So, we need to scan this paragraph carefully. In lines 7-13, the writer says, “. . . . These turned out to be highly diverse: it seems that ants are continually domesticating new species. Even more impressively, DNA analysis of the fungi suggests that the ants improve or modify the fungi by regularly swapping and sharing strains with neighbouring ant colonies.” Here, upgrade = improve or modify, exchange = swapping and sharing, So, the answer is: D (exchanging) Questions 11, 12 13: In fact, the farming methods of ants could be said to be more advanced than human agribusiness, since they use 11. ________ methods, they do not affect the 12. _______ and do not waste 13. ________. Keywords for the question: farming methods of ants, more advance than, human agribusiness, they use, methods, do not affect, do not waste, These questions give a clear hint to the comparison of farming methods between humans and ants. So, we need to go to paragraph no. 4, where the comparison of farming methods between humans and ants can be found. In lines 1-4 of this paragraph, the writer says, “The farming methods of ants are at least sustainable. They do not ruin environments or use enormous amounts of energy.” Here, The farming methods of ants are least sustainable = they use sustainable farming methods, do not ruin = do not affect/do not waste, So, the answers are: N (sustainable) O (environment) E (energy) Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Population movements and genetics Questions 14-19 (List of headings): [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph that will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence. ] Question 14: Section A We should quickly read the whole paragraph because it is a very short one. The first sentence deals with how the study of human population movements was in the past (based on archaeological and fossil evidence). Then in lines 4-7, the writer mentions, “A number of techniques developed since the 1950s, however, have placed the study of these subjects on a sounder and more objective footing.” After that in lines 8-11, the writer mentions how the study of human population movements is done in the present time using genetic material. So, the answer is: iv (Developments in the methods used to study early population movements) Question 15: Section B Section B raises some questions about migration to America and they are found in the middle of the section. In lines 8-12 the author asks, “… .. . But was there one major wave of migration across the Bering Strait into the Americas, or several? And when did this event, or events, take place?” So, the answer is: vii (Long-standing questions about prehistoric migration to America) Question 16: Section C Have a look at the first and last few lines of section C. In lines 1-6 the writer mentions, “An important project, led by the biological anthropologist Robert Williams, focused on the variants (called Gm allotypes) of one particular protein -immunoglobin G – found in the fluid portion of human blood. .” Then in lines 11-16 the writer mentions, “ . . . . . Thus, by comparing the Gm allotypes of two different populations (e.g. two Indian tribes), one can establish their genetic ‘distance’, which itself can be calibrated to give an indication of the length of time since these populations last interbred.” Here, blood-variants = the variants found in human blood, measure corresponds to = give an indication of the length of, closeness of the relationship = interbred, So, the lines suggest that the project was an analysis of blood variants and it measures the distance (closeness) of the link between different populations. So, the answer is: x (How analysis of blood-variants measures the closeness of the relationship between different populations) Question 17: Section D Section D shows the outcomes of the project by Robert Williams and his colleagues. In the first lines the writer says, “Williams and his colleagues sampled the blood of over 5,000 American Indians in western North America during a twenty-year period.” Then in lines 4-7 the writer mentions, “ .. . . They found that their Gm allotypes could be divided into two groups, one of which also corresponded to the genetic typing of Central and South American Indians. Other tests showed that the Inuit (or Eskimo) and Aleut3 formed a third group.” Therefore, we can guess that section D talks about the results of the research into blood-variants. So, the answer is: i (The results of the research into blood-variants) Question 18: Section E In section E, the first lines say, “How far does other research support these conclusions?” The lines suggest that other research has been done on blood-variants. Then, in lines 2-9, the writer says, “ . .. Geneticist Douglas Wallace has studied mitochondrial DNA4 in blood samples from three widely separated Native American groups: Pima-Papago Indians in Arizona, Maya Indians on the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico, and Ticuna Indians in the Upper Amazon region of Brazil.” These lines mean that Douglas Wallace is a scientist who works with genes and other genetic matters. He has studied the DNA in blood samples of three groups of people; Pima-Papago, Maya Indians and Ticuna Indians. So, the answer is: vi (Further genetic evidence relating to the three-wave theory) Question 19: Section F Section F opens with these lines, “There are two other kinds of research that have thrown some light on the origins of the Native American population; they involve the study of teeth and of languages.” Then, in the next few lines we find words like teeth, tooth crown and roots, single-rooted, triple-rooted etc. So, the answer is: ii (Dental evidence) Questions 20 and 21: (Completing Table) (In this type of question candidates need to fill in the gaps in a table. For this table candidates need to write the letter that corresponds to the correct migration routes out of six routes.) These questions are related to Robert Williams’ research results which can be traced in Section D. Question 20: Route _____________ Keywords for the question: 15,000 or more, years ago, In section D, the author says in lines 10-16, “ .. . . From this evidence, it was deduced that there had been three major waves of migration across the Bering Strait. The first, Paleo-lndian, wave more than 15,000 years ago was ancestral to all Central and South American Indians.” Now, if we look closely at the given picture, we can find out that only route E (marked with red arrows) starts somewhere from Asia, crossing the Bering Strait and then continues to Central and South America. So, the answer is: E Question 21: Route _____________ Keywords for the question: 600 to 700, years ago, In section D, the author says in lines 16-21, “ . .. . The second wave, about 14,000-12,000 years ago, brought Na-Dene hunters, ancestors of the Navajo and Apache (who only migrated south from Canada about 600 or 700 years ago).” Again, if we look closely at the given picture, we can find out that route C (marked with pink arrows) starts from Asia, crossing the Bering Strait and then stops in South Canada (first period – 14,000-12,000 years ago). Then, in the second period (600 to 700 years ago) they took route D (marked with blue arrows) to the south from Canada. So, the answer is: D Questions 22-25 (Classifying groups) [This type of question asks candidates to classify information from the given reading text. Candidates are given some groups from the text, and a list of options, which are listed as A, B, C etc. They must match the correct groups with the correct options. N.B.: This question doesn’t follow any sequence. So, they should be answered after all other questions in the passage.] Question 22: Name of group: Inuit Wave number: ________ Keywords for this question: Inuit, Take a close look at section D, where we find the reference of the three waves for the first time. Here, in the last lines, the writer says, “ . . . The third wave, perhaps 10,000 or 9,000 years ago, saw the migration from North-east Asia of groups ancestral to the modern Eskimo and Aleut.” So, the group name is Eskimo and Aleut. But, Eskimo and Aleut is not an option in the question. What should we do now? In section D, take a look at lines 8-10, “… .. . Other tests showed that the Inuit (or Eskimo) and Aleut3 formed a third group.” Therefore, Eskimo means Inuit. So, the answer is: C (the third wave) Question 23: Name of group: Apache Wave number: ________ Keywords for this question: Apache, Again, in section D, the author writes in lines 16-21, “ . .. The second wave, about 14,000-12,000 years ago, brought Na-Dene hunters, ancestors of the Navajo and Apache (who only migrated south from Canada about 600 or 700 years ago).” So, the answer is: B (the second wave) Question 24: Name of group: Pima-Papago Wave number: ________ Keywords for this question: Pima-Papago, Question 25: Name of group: Ticuna Wave number: ________ Keywords for this question: Ticuna, First, take a look at lines 13-16 in section D, “.. . .. The first, Paleo-lndian, wave more than 15,000 years ago was ancestral to all Central and South American Indians.” This means Paleo-Indians were originated from the first wave (A). Now, in section E, read lines 2-13, the writer explains the Paleo-Indian group, “Geneticist Douglas Wallace has studied mitochondrial DNA4 in blood samples from three widely separated Native American groups: Pima-Papago Indians in Arizona, Maya Indians on the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico, and Ticuna Indians in the Upper Amazon region of Brazil. As would have been predicted by Robert Williams’ work, all three groups appear to be descended from the same ancestral (Paleo-lndian) population.” These lines suggest that Pima-Papago Indians, Maya Indians and Ticuna Indians are all descendants of Paleo-Indian population. So, the answers are: A (the first wave) A (the first wave) Question 26: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question 26: Christy Turner’s research involved the examination of – Keywords for this question: Christy Turner’s research, examination of, We find the reference of Christy Turner’s research in section F. Here, in lines 10-14, the writer says, “ . . . Studies carried out by Turner of many thousands of New and Old World specimens, both ancient and modern, . .. . .. .” Therefore, it can be understood from these lines that Christy Turner’s research involved the examination of teeth from both ancient (prehistoric) and modern Americans and Asians. So, the answer is: A (teeth from both prehistoric and modern Americans and Asians) Reading Passage 2: No title The subject of the passage: saving European forests Questions 27-33: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 27: Forest problems of Mediterranean countries are to be discussed at the next meeting of experts. Keywords for this question: forest problems, Mediterranean countries, to be discussed, next meeting of experts, The reference of the Mediterranean countries is found in the last lines of paragraph no. 1. Let’s read the line, “Those confined to particular geographical areas, such as countries bordering the Mediterranean or the Nordic countries therefore had to be discarded. However, this does not mean that in future they will be ignored.” These lines suggest that the first two meetings of experts had no chance to discuss the problems of the Mediterranean or the Nordic countries. However, they are hopeful that they might discuss it in the future but they are not sure when exactly that is going to happen. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 28: Problems in Nordic countries were excluded because they are outside the European Economic Community. Keywords for this question: problems, Nordic countries, excluded, because, outside, European Economic Community, Take a look at paragraph no. 1, lines 16-19 where the writer states, “ . .. . Their initial task was to decide which of the many forest problems of concern to Europe involved the largest number of countries and might be the subject of joint action. Those confined to particular geographical areas, such as countries bordering the Mediterranean or the Nordic countries, therefore, had to be discarded.” This means the reason is to involve countries of Europe that involved largest number of countries and share the same issue. So, the action can be linked easily. The reason is not that Nordic countries are outside the European Economic Community. Here, excluded = discarded, So, the answer is: FALSE Question 29: Forests are a renewable source of raw material. Keywords for this question: forests, renewable source, raw material, Take a look at paragraph no. 2, line no. 4-5 where the writer states, “.. . .. At the same time, forests provide raw materials for human activities through their constantly renewed production of wood.” Here, the lines clearly and easily match with the question. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 30: The biological functions of forests were recognised only in the twentieth century. Keywords for this question: biological functions, forests, recognised, only, twentieth century, Paragraph no. 2 starts with this line, “As a whole, European countries see forests as performing a triple function: biological, economic and recreational.” Then the author goes to explain the time of recognising of the functions in lines 8-10, “ . .. . The economic importance of forests has been understood since the dawn of man – wood was the first fuel. The other aspects have been recognised only for a few centuries. . . . .” Here, other aspects = biological and recreational aspects of forests, This means the biological functions of forests were recognised for a few centuries, not in the twentieth century only. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 31: Natural forests still exist in parts of Europe. Keywords for this question: natural forests, still, exist, parts of Europe, The answer can be traced at the beginning of paragraph no. 3. The writer says here, “The myth of the ‘natural’ forest has survived, yet there are effectively no remaining ‘primary’ forests in Europe. All European forests are artificial. . . .. ” Here, myth = falsehood, primary forests = natural forests, artificial = not natural, This means there are no primary or natural forests in Europe. All of them are artificial. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 32: Forest policy should be limited by national boundaries. Keywords for this question: forest policy, should be limited, national boundaries, In paragraph no. 3, the writer explains in lines 3-4, “ . . . This means that a forest policy is vital, that it must transcend national frontiers and generations of people, . .. .” Here, transcend = rise above / go beyond, national frontiers = national boundaries, The lines indicate that forest policy should not be limited by national frontiers or boundaries; it must transcend national boundaries. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 33: The Strasbourg conference decided that a forest policy must allow for the possibility of change. Keywords for this question: Strasbourg conference, decided, forest policy, must allow, possibility of change, In paragraph no. 3, the writer explains, “. . . . a forest policy is vital, that it must transcend national frontiers and generations of people, and that it must allow for the inevitable changes that take place in the forests, in needs, and hence in policy. The Strasbourg conference was one of the first events on such a scale to reach this conclusion.” Therefore, the Strasbourg conference decided/ reached the conclusion that a forest policy must allow for the inevitable changes (the possibility of change). So, the answer is: TRUE Questions 34-39: (Matching statements with appropriate information) [In this type of question candidates are asked to match some statements with some information given from the passage. This type of question generally appears in passage 3. These questions will not follow any sequential order. So, skimming first for the keywords and then scanning to match the information is the best option to find answers to these questions.] All the answers will be in the last paragraph because this paragraph talks about all the six resolutions. Question 34: Resolution 1 Keywords for this question: Resolution 1, In the first line, the writer introduces the resolutions, “That general declaration was accompanied by six detailed resolutions to assist national policymaking.” Then, in the next lines, the writer says, “ .. . The first proposes the extension and systematisation of surveillance sites to monitor forest decline.” Then in the next few lines, the author describes how forests are declining fast without proper monitoring. Here, the extension and systematisation of surveillance sites = information is to be systematically gathered, forest decline = decline in the condition of forests, So, the answer is: J (Information is to be systematically gathered on any decline in the condition of forests.) Question 35: Resolution 2 Keywords for this question: Resolution 2, In lines 10-12 of paragraph no. 4, the writer says, “ . . . The second resolution concentrates on the need to preserve the genetic diversity of European forests. The aim is to reverse the decline in the number of tree species or at least to preserve the ‘genetic material’ of all of them.” The lines suggest that the genetic material of all kinds of tree species need to be preserved. So, the answer is: A (All kinds of species of trees should be preserved.) Question 36: Resolution 3 Keywords for this question: Resolution 3, We find the mention of Resolution 3 in lines 11-15 which deals with forest fires, “ .. .. . Although forest fires do not affect all of Europe to the same extent, the amount of damage caused the experts to propose as the third resolution that the Strasbourg conference consider the establishment of a European databank on the subject. All information used in the development of national preventative policies would become generally available.” Here, establishment of a European databank = information on forest fires should be preserved, all information . . . .would become generally available = all information should be shared, So, the answer is: E (Information on forest fires should be collected and shared.) Question 37: Resolution 4 Keywords for this question: Resolution 4, In lines 15-19, the author talks about the fourth resolution on mountain forests, “ . .. .. The subject of the fourth resolution discussed by the ministers was mountain forests. In Europe, it is undoubtedly the mountain ecosystem which has changed most rapidly and is most at risk. A thinly scattered permanent population and development of leisure activities, particularly skiing, have resulted in significant long-term changes to the local ecosystems. Proposed developments include a preferential research program on mountain forests.” So, the answer is: B (Fragile mountain forests should be given priority in research programs.) Question 38: Resolution 5 Keywords for this question: Resolution 5, Lines 19-21 talk about the fifth resolution that discusses research into tree diseases, “ . . .. The fifth resolution relaunched the European research network on the physiology of trees, called Eurosilva. Eurosilva should support joint European research on tree diseases and their physiological and biochemical aspects.” Therefore, the statement indicates that necessary resources should be allocated to research into tree diseases and their physiological and biochemical matters. So, the answer is: G (Resources should be allocated to research into tree diseases.) Question 39: Resolution 6 Keywords for this question: Resolution 6, Lines 23-25 of paragraph no. 4 says, “ . . . . Finally, the conference established the framework for a European research network on forest ecosystems. This would also involve harmonising activities in individual countries as well as identifying a number of priority research topics relating to the protection of forests.” Here, harmonising = co-ordinating, The lines indicate that a research network is a much better way if harmonized or co-ordinated throughout Europe. So, the answer is: D (Research is to be better co-ordinated throughout Europe.) Question 40: Multiple choice questions (Identifying the main purpose/aim of the passage) [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options that shows the main aim/purpose using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] What is the best title for Reading Passage 3? Keywords for this question: best title, Reading Passage 3, If we closely look at the main ideas for all the four paragraphs, we can find out the followings: Paragraph no. 1 deals with the need for new policies by European nations to save their forests. Paragraph no. 2 talks about the main work or function of forests. Paragraph no. 3 describes the importance of policies that are coordinated. Paragraph no. 4 talks about the six resolutions proposed in the Strasbourg conference to protect European forests. Therefore, we can come to the conclusion that the purpose or aim of the passage is to provide plans to protect European forests. So, the answer is: B (Plans to protect the forests of Europe)",

      "content_clean": "Reading Passage 1: The headline of the passage: Pulling strings to build pyramids Question 1: It is generally believed that large numbers of people were needed to build the pyramids. Keywords for the question: generally believed, large numbers of people, needed, build the pyramids, At the beginning of paragraph no. 1 the writer says, “The pyramids of Egypt were built more than three thousand years ago, and no one knows how. The conventional picture is that tens of thousands of slaves dragged stones on sledges.” Here, the conventional picture = generally believed, tens of thousands of slaves = large numbers of people, So, the answer is: TRUE Question 2: Clemmons found a strange hieroglyph on the wall of an Egyptian monument. Keywords for the question: Clemmons, found, strange hieroglyph, wall, Egyptian monument, In paragraph no. 1, lines 7-9, the writer mentions, “While perusing a book on the monuments of Egypt, she noticed a hieroglyph that showed a row of men standing in odd postures.” Here, odd postures = strange postures, noticed = found, So, the hieroglyph was found in a book, not in a wall. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 3: Gharib had previously done experiments on bird flight. Keywords for the question: Gharib, previously, experiments, bird flight, The reference of Morteza Gharib is found in paragraph no. 2. However, there is no mention of whether he previously did experiments on bird flight or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 4: Gharib and Graff tested their theory before applying it. Keywords for the question: Gharib and Graff, tested, theory, before, applying, Paragraph no. 3 presents details about how Gharib and Graff prepared for some experiments to test their theory and paragraph no. 4 shows the results of those experiments. Here, in paragraph no. 3, take a look at lines 2-4, “Their initial calculations and scale-model wind-tunnel experiments convinced them they wouldn’t need a strong wind to lift the 33.5-tonne column.” This means they did experiments on their theory before applying it. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 5: The success of the actual experiment was due to the high speed of the wind. Keywords for the question: success, actual experiment, due to, high speed, wind, The answer can be found in lines 1-2 of paragraph no. 5. The writer says here, “The wind was blowing at a gentle 16 to 20 kilometres an hour, little more than half what they thought would be needed.” Here, little more than half what they thought would be needed means the wind had a speed of a little more than half of what they thought would be needed. So, it was the low speed of wind, not the high speed of wind what gave the experiment a success. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 6: They found that, as the kite flew higher, the wind force got stronger. Keywords for the question: kite, flew, higher, wind force, got stronger, The result of the experiment with kites can be found in paragraph no. 5. There is no information about what happened when the kite flew higher or lower. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 7: The team decided that it was possible to use kites to raise very heavy stones. Keywords for the question: team, decided, was possible, use kites, to raise, very heavy stones, Take a look at this line from paragraph no. 5, “ . .. . So Clemmons was right: the pyramid, builders could have used kites to lift massive stones into place.” So, the researchers decided that it was possible to use kites to raise very heavy stones. So, the answer is: TRUE Questions 7-13: (Summary completion) (In this kind of questions candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the similar steps of finding answers to fill in the gaps and write the correct answer.) The title of the summary: Additional evidence for theory of kite-lifting All the answers are found in paragraph no. 7 as the title of the summary says ‘Additional evidence’ and paragraph no. 7 starts with the sentence, “Others feel there is more of a case for the theory.” Here, more of a case = additional evidence, Questions 8, 9 10: The Egyptians had 8. _________ which could lift large pieces of 9. _________ and they knew how to use the energy of the wind from their skill as 10. __________. Keywords for the question: Egyptians, had, could lift, large pieces of, knew, how to use, energy of the wind, their skill as, In paragraph no. 7, in lines 1-4, the author says, “ . .. .. Harnessing the wind would not have been a problem for accomplished sailors like the Egyptians. And they are known to have used wooden pulleys, which could have been made strong enough to bear the weight of massive blocks of stone.” Here, massive blocks of = large pieces of, So, wooden pulleys were used to lift large pieces of stone. Also, from their skill as indicates to the skill of the Egyptians as sailors. So, the answers are: (wooden) pulleys stone (accomplished) sailors Questions 11 12: The discovery on one pyramid of an object which resembled a 11. ___________ suggests they may have experimented with 12. _________. Keywords for the question: discovery, one pyramid, an object, resembled, suggests, may have, experimented with, In lines 5-8 of the same paragraph, the author writes, “ . . .. A wooden artefact found on the step pyramid at Saqqara looks uncannily like a modern glider. Although it dates from several hundred years after the building of the pyramids, its sophistication suggests that the Egyptians might have been developing ideas of flight for a long time.” Here, looks uncannily like = resembled, might have been developing ideas = may have experimented, So, the answers are: (modern) glider flight Questions 13: In addition, over two thousand years ago kites were used in China as weapons, as well as for sending 13. _________. Keywords for the question: over two thousand years ago, kites, used, China, weapons, as well as, sending, In the last lines of this paragraph, the writer says, “ .. .. . And other ancient civilisations certainly knew about kites; as early as 1250 BC, the Chinese were using them to deliver messages and dump flaming debris on their foes.” Here, as early as 1250 BC = over two thousand years ago, kites were used … . as weapons = dump flaming debris on their foes, deliver = sending, So, the answer is: messages Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Endless Harvest Questions 14-20: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN] [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 14: The inhabitants of the Aleutian islands renamed their islands ‘Aleyska’. Keywords for the question: inhabitants, Aleutian islands, renamed, ‘Aleyska’, Let’s take a look at the very beginning of the passage. In paragraph no. 1 we find some information about naming the islands. The author says here, “More than two hundred years ago, Russian explorers and fur hunters landed on the Aleutian Islands, a volcanic archipelago in the North Pacific, and learned of a land mass that lay farther to the north. ‘The islands’ native inhabitants called this land mass Aleyska, the ‘Great Land’; today, we know it as Alaska.” From these lines, we can realise that native inhabitants of the islands named it (called) ‘Aleyska’. They did not rename it. Nowadays, we know it as ‘Alaska’, it’s newly named (renamed). So, the answer is: FALSE Question 15: Alaska’s fisheries are owned by some of the world’s largest companies. Keywords for the question: Alaska’s fisheries, owned by, world’s largest companies, Paragraph no. 2 talks about fisheries in Alaska; however, there is no information on the ownership of Alaska’s fisheries. The last lines of this paragraph only says, “ . .. Taking advantage of this rich bounty, Alaska’s commercial fisheries have developed into some of the largest in the world.” So, it talks about the size of the commercial fisheries, not the ownership. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 16: Life in Alaska is dependent on salmon. Keywords for the question: life, Alaska, dependent on, salmon, The answer lies in paragraph no. 3, lines 3-6, “ . . .. The true cultural heart and soul of Alaska’s fisheries, however, is salmon. ‘Salmon,’ notes writer Susan Ewing in The Great Alaska Nature Factbook, ‘pump through Alaska like blood through a heart, bringing rhythmic, circulating nourishment to land, animals and people.” The lines clearly match with the statement in question no. 16. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 17: Ninety per cent of all Pacific salmon caught are sockeye or pink salmon. Keywords for the question: Ninety per cent, all Pacific salmon caught, sockeye, pink salmon, In paragraph no. 3, take a look at lines 8-10. The writer mentions, “ . . . . All five species of Pacific salmon – chinook, or king; chum, or dog; coho, or silver; sockeye, or red; and pink, or humpback – spawn** in Alaskan waters, and 90% of all Pacific salmon commercially caught in North America are produced there.” Here, the writer says that 90% of all salmon caught commercially in North America comes from Alaska. It doesn’t mention about the percentage of particular types. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 18: More than 320,000 tonnes of salmon were caught in Alaska in 2000. Keywords for the question: More than, 320,000 tonnes of salmon, caught, Alaska, 2000, The last lines of paragraph no. 3 gives us information about the total weight of salmon caught in 2000 in Alaska, “ . … . During 2000, commercial catches of Pacific salmon in Alaska exceeded 320,000 tonnes, with an ex-vessel value of over $US 260 million.” Here, exceeded = more than, So, the answer is: TRUE Question 19: Between 1940 and 1959, there was a sharp decrease in Alaska’s salmon population. Keywords for the question: between 1940 and 1959, sharp decrease, Alaska’s, salmon population, In the very beginning of paragraph no. 4, the writer says, “.. .. . Between 1940 and 1959, overfishing led to crashes in salmon populations so severe that in 1953 Alaska was declared a federal disaster area.” Here, crashes in salmon populations so severe = there was a sharp decrease in Alaska’s salmon populations. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 20: During the 1990s, the average number of salmon caught each year was 100 million. Keywords for the question: During, 1990s, average number of salmon, caught each year, 100 million, Take a look at the last few lines of paragraph no. 4, “ . . .. . . until, during the 1990s, annual harvests were well in excess of 100 million, and on several occasions over 200 million fish.” Here, well in excess of = way over / way more than, So, the answer is: FALSE Questions 21-26 (Completing sentences with correct endings) [For this type of question, candidates need to match the beginning and ending of sentences. Candidates need to look for keywords in the sentence-beginnings and find the relative paragraphs and then sentences in the passage. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question 21: In Alaska, biologists keep a check on adult fish – Keywords for the question: Alaska, biologists, check on, adult fish, In paragraph no. 5 the writer says, “.. … . There are biologists throughout the state constantly monitoring adult fish as they show up to spawn. The biologists sit in streamside counting towers, study sonar, watch from aeroplanes, and talk to fishermen. The salmon season in Alaska is not pre-set. The fishermen know the approximate time of year when they will be allowed to fish, but on any given day, one or more field biologists in a particular area can put a halt to fishing. Even sport fishing can be brought to a halt. It is this management mechanism that has allowed Alaska salmon stocks – and, accordingly, Alaska salmon fisheries — to prosper, . . .. .. .” Here, the writer indicates that biologists keep monitoring adult salmons so that fish numbers can improve and fishing can be permitted on a large scale. So, the answer is: G (to ensure that fish numbers are sufficient to permit fishing.) Question 22: Biologists have the authority – Keywords for this question: Biologists, authority, In paragraph no. 5, we can see the authority that biologists can apply on fishing. Take a look at lines 5-7, “ . .. but on any given day, one or more field biologists in a particular area can put a halt to fishing. Even sport fishing can be brought to a halt.” Here, put a halt / can be brought to halt = to stop, So, the answer is: E (to stop people fishing for sports.) Question 23: In-Season Abundance-Based Management has allowed the Alaska salmon fisheries – Keywords for this question: In-season, Abundance-Based Management, allowed, Alaska salmon fisheries, Paragraph no. 5 starts citing about In-Season Abundance-Based Management. Then, in lines 7-8, the author says, “. . .. .. It is this management mechanism that has allowed Alaska salmon stocks – and, accordingly, Alaska salmon fisheries — to prosper, .. . .” Here, to prosper = to be successful, So, the answer is: B (to be successful.) Question 24: The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) was established – Keywords for this question: Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), established, In paragraph no. 6, lines 1-3 says, “In 1999, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)*** commissioned a review of the Alaska salmon fishery. The Council, which was founded in 1996, certifies fisheries that meet high environmental standards, enabling them to use a label that recognises their environmental responsibility.” Here, founded = established, certifies = to recognise, recognises their environmental responsibility = care for the environment, So, the answer is: A (to recognise fisheries that care for the environment.) Question 25: As a result of the collapse of the salmon runs in 1999, the state decided – Keywords for this question: As a result of, collapse, salmon, runs, 1999, state decided, In paragraph no. 7 we find the reference to the collapse of the salmon number in 1999, “Some observers thought the Alaska salmon fisheries would not have any chance of certification when, in the months leading up to MSC’s final decision, salmon runs throughout western Alaska completely collapsed.” Then in the next paragraph, the writer explained what happened as a result of this collapse, and in the last lines of this paragraph, the writer mentions, “. .. . However, the state reacted quickly, closing down all fisheries, even those necessary for subsistence purposes.” So, the answer is: K (to close down all fisheries.) Question 26: In September 2000, the MSC allowed seven Alaska salmon companies – Keywords for this question: September 2000, MSC, allowed, seven Alaska salmon companies, In the last paragraph, the first lines say, “In September 2000, MSC announced that the Alaska salmon fisheries qualified for certification. Seven companies producing Alaska salmon were immediately granted permission to display the MSC logo on their products.” Here, granted permission = allowed, display = label, So, the answer is: F (to label their products using the MSC logo.) Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: EFFECTS OF NOISE Questions 27-29: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question 27: The writer suggests that people may have difficulty sleeping in the mountains because – Keywords for this question: may have difficulty, sleeping, mountains, because, The writer says in lines 1-4 of paragraph no. 2-4, “ . . . . And yet most of us have had the experience of having to adjust to sleeping in the mountains or the countryside because it was initially ‘too quiet’, an experience that suggests that humans are capable of adapting to a wide range of noise levels.” Here, humans = they, wide range of noise levels = higher noise level, So, the answer is: D (they may have adapted to a higher noise level in the city.) Question 28: In noise experiments, Glass and Singer found that – Keywords for this question: noise experiments, Glass and Singer, In lines 7-8 of paragraph no. 1 the writer states, “The noise was quite disruptive at first, but after about four minutes the subjects were doing just as well on their tasks as control subjects who were not exposed to noise.” This means that bursts of noise do not disrupt problem-solving ultimately (subjects were doing just as well on their tasks). So, the answer is: C (bursts of noise do not seriously disrupt problem-solving in the long run.) Question 29: Researchers discovered that high noise levels are not likely to interfere with the – Keywords for this question: Researchers, discovered, high noise levels, not likely, interfere with, Take a look at paragraph no. 2, line no. 1-2 where the writer states, “But there are limits to adaptation and loud noise becomes more troublesome if the person is required to concentrate on more than one task.” The lines suggest that there is a low chance of interference by high noise levels if a person is required to do one task. But if there is more than one task, the chance of interference becomes higher. So, the answer is: A (successful performance of a single task.) Questions 30-34: (Completing summary with a list of words) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete a summary with a list of words taken from the passage. Candidates must write the correct letter (not the words) as the answers. Keywords and synonyms are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Question 30: Glass and Singer (1972) showed that situations in which there is intense noise have less effect on performance than circumstances in which _____________ noise occurs. Keywords for this question: Glass and Singer (1972), situations, intense noise, less effect, performance, than circumstances, noise occurs, In lines 2-4 of paragraph no. 3, the writer describes, “. . . . . We are much more able to ‘tune out’ chronic background noise, even if it is quite loud, than to work under circumstances with unexpected intrusions of noise.” Here, quite loud = intense, So, the answer is: B (unexpected) Question 31: Subjects were divided into groups to perform a task. Some heard loud bursts of noise, others sort. For some subjects, the noise was predictable, while for others its occurrence was random. All groups were exposed to __________ noise. Keywords for this question: subjects, divided, perform a task, loud burst of noise, predictable, occurrence was random, all groups, exposed to, In paragraph no. 3, the writer states in lines 6-8, “.. .. . For some subjects, the bursts were spaced exactly one minute apart (predictable noise); others heard the same amount of noise overall, but the bursts occurred at random intervals (unpredictable noise).” The lines suggest that though for some subjects the bursts of noise were exactly at one-minute intervals and for others the intervals were random, the amount of noise was the same. So, the answer is: D (the same amount of) Question 32: The predictable noise group ___________ the unpredictable noise group on this task. Keywords for this question: predictable noise group, unpredictable noise group, Again, in paragraph no. 3, the author states in lines 8-10, “ . . . Subjects reported finding the predictable and unpredictable noise equally annoying, and all subjects performed at about the same level during the noise portion of the experiment . .. .” So, the answer is: F (performed at about the same level as) Question 33: In the second part of the experiment, the four groups were given a proofreading task to complete under conditions of no noise. They were required to check written material for errors. The group which had been exposed to unpredictable noise ___________ the group which had been exposed to predictable noise. Keywords for this question: second part of the experiment, four groups, proofreading task, under conditions of no noise, check written material, errors, exposed to, unpredictable noise, predictable noise, In paragraph no. 3, the writer talks about the second part of the experiment in lines 10-14, “. . . . But the different noise conditions had quite different after-effects when the subjects were required to proofread written material under conditions of no noise. As shown in Table 1 the unpredictable noise produced more errors in the later proofreading task than predictable noise; and soft, unpredictable noise actually produced slightly more errors on this task than the loud, predictable noise.” Here, produced .. .. more errors = make more mistakes, So, the answer is: I (made more mistakes than) Question 34: The group which had been exposed to loud predictable noise performed better than those who had heard soft, unpredictable bursts. The results suggest that __________ noise produces fatigue but that this manifests itself later. Keywords for this question: results suggest, noise, produces fatigue, manifests itself later, In paragraph no. 4, the writer discusses the results found from the experiments in paragraph no. 3, “Apparently, unpredictable noise produces more fatigue than predictable noise, but it takes a while for this fatigue to take its toll on performance.” Here, unpredictable = unexpected, So, the answer is: B (unexpected) Questions 35-40 (Matching statements with the correct researchers) (In this type of question, candidates need to relate statements which are given by or links to some researchers in the passage. The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the name of the researchers and read around them carefully. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same researchers in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions may not follow any sequential order.) Question 35: Subjects exposed to noise find it difficult at first to concentrate on problem-solving tasks. Keywords for this question: subjects, exposed to noise, difficult, concentrate, problem-solving tasks, Have a look at paragraph no. 1 where the writer says in lines 5-7, “ . .. .. For example, Glass and Singer (1972) exposed people to short bursts of very loud noise and then measured their ability to work out problems and their physiological reactions to the noise. The noise was quite disruptive at first,. . .” Here, disruptive = difficult to concentrate, So, the answer is: A (Glass and Singer) Question 36: Long-term exposure to noise can produce changes in behaviour which can still be observed a year later. Keywords for this question: long-term exposure, changes, behaviour, still be observed, a year later, In the final paragraph the writer explains, “A follow-up study showed that children who were moved to less noisy classrooms still showed greater distractibility one year later than students who had always been in the quiet schools (Cohen et al, 1981).” Here, one year = long-term exposure, So, the answer is: D (Cohen et al.) Question 37: The problems associated with exposure to noise do not arise if the subject knows they can make it stop. Keywords for this question: problems, exposure to noise, do not arise, if, subject knows, can make it stop, In paragraph no. 5, we find the writer arguing that, “ .. . If the individual knows that he or she can control the noise, this seems to eliminate both its negative effect at the time and its after-effects. This is true even if the individual never actually exercises his or her option to turn the noise off (Glass and Singer, 1972).” Here, control = stop, So, the answer is: A (Glass and Singer) Question 38: Exposure to high-pitched noise results in more errors than exposure to low-pitched noise. Keywords for this question: exposure to high-pitched noise, result in more errors, than, low-pitched noise, In paragraph no. 2, the writer explains the fact that it was found by Broadbent that loud noise becomes a problem, and we make more mistakes, when a person has to concentrate on more than one task. However, this gives us idea about the limit on how bad or how well we can adapt to exposure to loud noise. We find no reference of any researchers about high-pitched noise gives birth to more noise. So, the answer is: E (None of the above) Question 39: Subjects find it difficult to perform three tasks at the same time when exposed to noise. Keywords for this question: subjects, difficult to perform, three tasks, same time, when, exposed to noise, We can find this answer in paragraph no. 2. Here, in lines 2-4, the writer states, “ . .. . For example, high noise levels interfered with the performance of subjects who were required to monitor three dials at a time, a task not unlike that of an aeroplane pilot or an air-traffic controller (Broadbent, 1957).” Here, required to monitor three dials at a time = perform three tasks at the same time, So, the answer is: B (Broadbent) Question 40: Noise affects a subject’s capacity to repeat numbers while carrying out another task. Keywords for this question: noise affects, subject’s capacity, to repeat numbers, while, another task, Again, in paragraph no. 2, the author writes in lines 5-7, “ . .. . Similarly, noise did not affect a subject’s ability to track a moving line with a steering wheel, but it did interfere with the subject’s ability to repeat numbers while tracking (Finkelman and Glass, 1970).” Here, tracking = carrying out another task, So, the answer is: C (Finkelman and Glass)",

Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 1: a description of an early timekeeping invention affected by cold temperatures Keywords for the question: early, timekeeping, affected by, cold temperatures, In paragraph D, the author says in lines 3-7, “One of the first water clocks was a basin. . .. .. . Although these devices performed satisfactorily around the Mediterranean; they could not always be depended on in the cloudy and freezing weather of northern Europe.” Here, early means one of the first, cold means freezing, So, the answer is: D Question 2: an explanation of the importance of geography in the development of the calendar in farming communities Keywords for the question: importance of geography, development, calendar, farming communities In paragraph B, the author mentions, “Before the invention of artificial light, the moon had greater social impact. And, for those living near the equator in particular, its waxing and waning was more conspicuous than the passing of the seasons. Hence, the calendars that were developed at the lower latitudes were influenced more by the lunar cycle than by the solar year. In more northern climes, however, where seasonal agriculture was practised, the solar year became more crucial.” Here, the moon had greater social impact means the importance of geography, agriculture means farming, So, the answer is: B Question 3: a description of the origins of the pendulum clock Keywords for the question: origins, pendulum clock, We have to skim paragraphs for ‘pendulum clock’. In paragraph F we find the mention of ‘pendulum clock’. In this paragraph, the author says in lines 7-8, “By the 16th century, a pendulum clock had been devised, but the pendulum swung in a large arc and thus was not very efficient.” The lines suggest that ‘pendulum clock’ originated (devised) in the 16th century. So, the answer is: F Question 4: details of the simultaneous efforts of different societies to calculate time using uniform hours Keywords for the question: simultaneous efforts, different societies, calculate time, uniform hours, In paragraph E, the writer indicates in lines 3-7, “…. in the early14th century, a number of systems evolved. The schemes that divided the day into 24 equal parts varied according to the start of the count: Italian hours began at sunset, Babylonian hours at sunrise, astronomical hours at midday and ‘great clock’ hours, used for some large public clocks in Germany, at midnight. Eventually these were superseded by ‘small clock’, or French, hours, which split the day into two 12-hour periods commencing at midnight.” Here, these efforts all occurred at around the same time means simultaneously, based on 24 equal parts means uniform hours, in different countries means different societies, So, the answer is: E Buy Cambridge IELTS 8 from this link. Questions 5-8: (Matching statements with correct nationality): (The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the keywords and read around different nationalities carefully. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same nationality in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions may not follow any sequential order. ) Question 5: They devised a civil calendar in which the months were equal in length. Keywords for the question: civil calendar, months, equal in length, In paragraph C, the writer describes in the beginning, “Centuries before the Roman Empire, the Egyptians had formulated a municipal calendar having 12 months of 30 days, with five days added to approximate the solar year.” Here, devised means formulated, civil means municipal, the months were equal in length means 12 months of 30 days, This means the Egyptians devised the civil calendar in which the months were equal. So, the answer is: B (Egyptians) Question 6: They divided the day into two equal halves. Keywords for the question: divided, two equal halves, In paragraph E, the writer indicates in the last lines, “Eventually, these were superseded by ‘small clock’, or French, hours, which split the day into two 12-hour periods commencing at midnight.” Here, divided means split, two equal halves means two 12-hour periods, So, it was the French, who divided the day into 12-hour periods. So, the answer is: F (French) Question 7: They developed a new cabinet shape for a type of timekeeper. Keywords for the question: new, cabinet shape, timekeeper, In paragraph G, the writer explains that the anchor escapement was invented in England in 1670 allowed the pendulum to travel in a very small arc. “. . . . It was called the anchor escapement, which was lever-based device shaped like a ship’s anchor.” “…. and thus led to the development of a new floor-standing case design, which became known as the grandfather clock.” Here, new floor-standing case design means cabinet shape, So, it was the English who designed this cabinet shape for this kind of timekeeper. So, the answer is: D (English) Question 8: They created a calendar to organize public events and work schedules. Keywords for the question: calendar, organize public events, work schedules, In the first paragraph, in lines 2-3, the author says, “ .. . … the Babylonians began to measure time, introducing calendars to co-ordinate communal activities, to plan the shipment of goods and, in particular, to regulate planting and harvesting.” Here, organize public events means co-ordinate communal activities, So, the answer is: A (Babylonians) Questions 9-13: (Labeling a diagram) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to label a diagram with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS from the passage. Keywords are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. However, we should not be surprised if the sequence is not maintained.

Question 9-11: escapement (resembling _____________) the __________ the __________ Keywords for the question: escapement, resembling, In paragraph G, the writer says in lines 2-3, “.. . . . It was called the anchor escapement, which was a lever-based device shaped like a ship’s anchor.. . .” So, the answer for question no. 9 is: (ship’s) anchor Again, in the same paragraph, in lines 3-4, “The motion of a pendulum rocks this device (escapement) so that it catches and releases each tooth of the escape wheel … … . .” So, the answer for question no. 10 is: (escape) wheel (the big second bracket indicates the whole shape) And the answer for question no. 11 is: tooth (each of the pointy edge which looks like tooth) Question 12 13: a _________ which beats each __________ Keywords for the question: beats each, Once again, in paragraph G, the writer says, “Moreover, this invention allowed the use of a long pendulum which could beat once a second and thus led to the development of a new floor-standing case design.” Here, beat once means beats each Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Air traffic control in the USA Questions 14-17 (List of headings): [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph which will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence. ] Question 14: Paragraph A In the first lines of paragraph A the writer says, “An accident that occurred in the skies over the Grand Canyon in 1956 resulted in the establishment of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to regulate and oversee the operation of aircraft in the skies over the United States.” Here, the lines suggest that the accident (disaster) in 1956 resulted (prompts) in the establishment of FAA. So, the answer is: ii (Aviation disaster prompts action) Question 15: Paragraph C In paragraph C, take a look at lines 3-5 where the author says, “.. .. .. It was only after the creation of the FAA that full-scale regulation of America’s airspace took place, and this was fortuitous, for the advent of the jet engine suddenly resulted in a large number of very fast planes… .” Here, fortuitous means chance, accidental or coincidental. So, the answer is: iii (Two coincidental developments) Question 16: Paragraph D Take a close look at lines no. 3 and read this sentence, “. . .This is a very incomplete part of the picture.” The line suggests that the role of ATC, as in many people’s thoughts, is a very incomplete picture/ oversimplified view. So, the answer is: v (An oversimplified view) Question 17: Paragraph E In paragraph E, the writer details about setting a controlled airspace which is commonly known as altitude zones: “In general, from 365m above the ground and higher, the entire country is blanketed by controlled airspace. In certain areas, mainly near airports, controlled airspace extends down to 215m above the ground . . . … . In this way, the recreational pilot who simply wishes to go flying for a while without all the restrictions composed by the FAA has only to stay in uncontrolled airspace, below 365m, . .. ..” Here, the lines clearly indicate that the writer is discussing here about setting altitude zones. So, the answer is: iv (Setting altitude zones) Question 18: Paragraph F It is very easy to find out what the writer discusses in Paragraph F if we study the first few lines, “In good meteorological conditions, flying would be permitted under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), which suggests a strong reliance on visual cues to maintain an acceptable level of safety. Poor visibility necessitated a set of Instrumental Flight Rules (IFR)…” Here, meteorological conditions = weather conditions, So, the answer is: viii (Setting rules to weather conditions) Question 19: Paragraph G The first 3-4 lines of paragraph G indicates that the writer categorises open airspace in this paragraph. “Controlled airspace is divided into several types, designated by letters of the alphabet. Uncontrolled airspace is designated Class F, while controlled airspace below 5,490m above sea level and not in the vicinity of an airport is Class E. All airspace above 5,490m is designated Class A. .. . ..” Here, Class F, Class E and Class A are the different airspace categories. So, the answer is: vii (Defining airspace categories) Buy Cambridge IELTS 8 from this link. Questions 20-26 (YES, NO, NOT GIVEN) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN] [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 20: The FAA was created as a result of the introduction of the jet engine. Keywords for this question: FAA, created, jet engine The first lines of paragraph A give us the answer for this question. The writer says here, “An accident that occurred in the skies over the Grand Canyon in 1956 resulted in the establishment of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).” This means the FAA was created as a result of an accident, not as a result of the introduction of the jet engine. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 21: Air Traffic Control started after the Grand Canyon crash in 1956. Keywords for this question: ATC, started, after Grand Canyon crash, 1956, Paragraph B starts with this line, “Rudimentary air traffic control (ATC) existed well before the Grand Canyon disaster.” The line clearly contradicts with the question. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 22: Beacons and flashing lights are still used by ATC today. Keywords for this question: Beacons, flashing lights, still used, In this passage, we find no mention of whether beacons and flashing lights are still used by ATC today. Beacons and flashing lights are referred to in paragraph B, but whether this system has been abandoned completely or is still used is not mentioned anywhere. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 23: Some improvements were made in radio communication during World War II. Keywords for this question: improvements, radio communication, World War II, In paragraph C, the writer describes in lines 1-3 “In the 1940s, ATC centres could and did take advantage of the newly developed radar and improved radio communication brought about by the Second World War.” The lines mean that there had been some improvements in radio communication during World War II. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 24: Class F airspace is airspace which is below 365m and not near airports. Keywords for this question: Class F, below 365m, not near airports, First, take a look at these lines from Paragraph E, “Elsewhere, in uncontrolled airspace, pilots are bound by fewer regulations. In this way, the recreational pilot who simply wishes to go flying for a while without all the restrictions composed by the FAA has only to stay in uncontrolled airspace, below 365m.” The last paragraph details the categorisation of different airspace. Here in line no. 2 the writer says, “Uncontrolled airspace is designated Class F.” So, this is clear that uncontrolled airspace is Class F which is below 365m and it is elsewhere, not in airports. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 25: All aircraft in Class E airspace must use IFR. Keywords for this question: All, Class E, must use IFR, In the last paragraph, Paragraph G, the writer says in lines 9-10, “The difference between Class E and A airspace is that in Class A, all operations are IFR . . …” This means that aircraft in Class A airspace must use IFR, not Class E. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 26: A pilot entering Class C airspace is flying over an average-sized city. Keywords for this question: Class C, an average-sized city, In the last paragraph, the writer states that in lines 13-15, “Three other types of airspace, Classes D, C and B, govern the vicinity of airports. These correspond roughly to small municipal, medium-sized metropolitan and major metropolitan airports respectively.” This means that Class C airspace indicates to medium-sized metropolitan airport areas. Here, city = metropolitan and average-sized = medium-sized So, the answer is: TRUE Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: Telepathy Questions 27-30 (Completing sentences/sentence completion) [Here, candidates have to complete sentences by matching one part of the sentence with the other. Candidates need to check the keywords from the question parts and try to match those keywords with the information given in the passage.] Question 27: Researchers with differing attitudes towards telepathy agree on Keywords for this question: differing attitudes, agree on, The author mentions in lines 1-5 of paragraph no. 2, “Some researchers say the results constitute compelling evidence that telepathy is genuine. Other parapsychologists believe the field is on the brink of collapse, having tried to produce definitive scientific proof and failed. Sceptics and advocates alike do concur on one issue, however: that the most impressive evidence so far has come from the so-called ‘ganzfeld experiments’, a German term that means ‘whole field’.” Here, Researchers with differing attitudes = Sceptics and advocates, agree on = concur on, So, the answer is: E (the significance of the ganzfeld experiments.) Question 28: Reports of experiences during meditation indicated Keywords for this question: experiences, during, meditation, The answer is found in paragraph no. 2. Here in lines 5-10, the author says, “. . . . Reports of telepathic experiences had by people during meditation led parapsychologists to suspect that telepathy might involve ‘signals’ passing between people that were so faint that they were usually swamped by normal brain activity. In this case, such signals might be more easily detected by those experiencing meditation-like tranquility in a relaxing ‘whole- field’ of light, sound and warmth.” The lines suggest that a suitable environment such as tranquility in a relaxing ‘whole- field’ of light, sound and warmth needs to be created for telepathy. So, the answer is: B (the need to create a suitable environment for telepathy.) Question 29: Attitudes to parapsychology would alter drastically with Keywords for this question: Attitudes to parapsychology, alter drastically, The answer lies in the first few lines of the final paragraph. Here, in lines 4-6 the writer says, “While physicists have demonstrated entanglement with specially prepared atoms, no-one knows if it also exists between atoms making up human minds. Answering such questions would transform parapsychology.” Here, transform = alter drastically The lines suggest that attitudes to parapsychology would completely change if any results can be found on whether specially prepared atoms are making up human minds or not. So, the answer is: A (the discovery of a mechanism for telepathy.) Question 30: Recent autoganzfeld trials suggest that success rates will improve with Keywords for this question: Recent autoganzfeld trials, success rates, improve with, In the final paragraph, in lines 8-13, the answer can be found. Here, the author writes, “Some work has begun already, with researchers trying to identify people who are particularly successful in autoganzfeld trials. Early results show that creative and artistic people do much better than average: in one study at the University of Edinburgh, musicians achieved a hit-rate of 56 percent. Perhaps more tests like these will eventually give the researchers the evidence they are seeking and strengthen the case for the existence of telepathy.” Here, hit rate = success rate, creative and artistic people or musicians = careful selection of subjects, So, the answer is: F (a more careful selection of subjects.)

Questions 31-40: (Completing table) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete different gaps in a table with NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS from the passage. Keywords are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. However, we should not be surprised if the sequence is not maintained. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Here is the table with the title: Telepathy Experiments Question 31, 32 33: Description: Involved a person acting as a 31. ________ who picked out one 32. ________ from a random selection of four, and a 33. _________ , who then tried to identify it. Keywords for this question: Ganzfeld studies 1982, person acting as, In paragraph 3, in the paragraph where the writer explains the early Ganzfeld experiments in 1982, in lines 3-6, the writer says, “In early ganzfeld experiments, the telepathy test involved identification of a picture chosen from a random selection of four taken from a large image bank. The idea was that a person acting as a ‘sender’ would attempt to beam the image over to the ‘receiver’ relaxing in the sealed room.” The lines indicate that the 1982 Ganzfeld studies involved a person, who acted as a ‘sender’, picked out one picture from a random selection of four pictures, and a receiver tried to identify it. So, the answers are: sender picture/image receiver Question 34 35: Flaw: Positive results could be produced by factors such as 34. __________ or 35. __________ . Keywords for this question: flaw, positive results could be produced, factors, In lines 4-6 of paragraph 4, the writer explains the flaw of the experiments, “ . . .. . . . there were many other ways of getting positive results. These ranged from ‘sensory leakage’ – where clues about the pictures accidentally reach the receiver – to outright fraud.” Here, sensory leakage and outright fraud are the factors the range is explained here using the prepositions ‘from’ and ‘to’. So, the answers are: sensory leakage (outright) fraud Question 36 37: Description: ________ were used for key tasks to limit the amount of 37. _________ in carrying out the tests. Keywords for this question: Autoganzfeld studies 1987, key tasks, limit the amount of, In paragraph 5, the writer says in the beginning, “After this, many researchers switched to autoganzfeld tests – an automated variant of the technique which used computers to perform many of the key tasks such as random selection of images. By minimising human involvement, the idea was to minimise the risk of flawed results.” Here, limit = minimise, So, they used computers to limit the amount of human involvement. So, the answers are: computers human involvement Question 38: Results: The results were then subjected to ________. Keywords for this question: results, subjected to, The answer lies in lines 4-6 of paragraph 5, the writer says, “In 1987, results from hundreds of autoganzfeld tests were studied by Honorton in a ‘meta-analysis’, a statistical technique for finding the overall results from a set of studies.” Here, tests were studied by Honorton in = the results were then subjected to, So, the answer is: meta-analysis Question 39 40: Flaw: ________ between different test results was put down to the fact that sample groups were not 40. ________ (as with most ganzfeld studies) Keywords for this question: different test results, put down, sample groups were not, In paragraph 6, the writer says in lines 1-6, “Yet some parapsychologists remain disturbed by the lack of consistency between individual ganzfeld tests. Defenders of telepathy point out that demanding impressive evidence from every study ignores one basic statistical fact: it takes large samples to detect small effects. If, as current results suggest, telepathy produces hit-rates only marginally above the 25 percent expected by chance, it’s unlikely to be detected by a typical ganzfeld study involving around 40 people: the group is just not big enough.” Here, different test results = individual ganzfeld tests, So, the answer is: lack of consistency big enough",

Keywords are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. However, we should not be surprised if the sequence is not maintained. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Here is the table with the title: Early methods of producing flat glass Question 1 2: Method: 1. _________ Advantages: Glass remained 2. __________ Keywords for the question: method, advantages, remained, Tips: To answer this question, we need to have a look at the whole table first and apply a trick. As you can see from the given picture, there are two early methods of producing float glass in this table. One is ‘Ribbon’ and we have to find the other one. You should probably know by now that most of the IELTS Reading question types follow a sequence; so we can figure out easily that the description of ‘Ribbon method’ is given in the text/passage right after the description of the method’s name we are looking for. Now, the mention of the ‘Ribbon method’ is found in the very beginning of Paragraph no. 2. So, we can safely assume that we’ll find the answer for question no. 1, 2 and 3 in paragraph no. 1. Let’s have a look. Remember the word ‘early’ in the table? This word suggests that the methods were the first methods of producing clear flat glass. Take a look at lines 3-6 of paragraph no. 1, “. . . .The first successful method for making clear, flat glass involved spinning. This method was very effective as the glass had not touched any surfaces between being soft and becoming hard, so it stayed perfectly unblemished, with a ‘fire finish’.” Here, The first successful method indicates that the name of the first method is spinning. Also, stayed = remained. So, the answers are: spinning (perfectly) unblemished Do you need Cambridge IELTS Series 8? Click here! Question 3: Disadvantages: Slow ____________ Keywords for the question: disadvantages, slow, Take a look at line no. 6 of paragraph no. 1. “However, the process took a long time, and was labour intensive.” So, here we find the disadvantages/ pitfalls/ problems related to this ‘spinning’ process. The first problem was that the process was slow (took a long time). The second problem was that it was labour intensive. So, the answer is: labour intensive Question 4: Advantages: Could produce glass sheets of varying ___________ Non-stop process Keywords for the question: Ribbon, advantages, produce glass sheets, varying, non-stop process, The answer is found in paragraph no. 2. In lines 2-4 the writer says, “. .. .The first continuous ribbon process involved squeezing molten glass through two hot rollers, similar to an old mangle. This allowed glass of virtually any thickness to be made non-stop. . .. .” Here, virtually any means nearly any kind of or varying So, the answer is: thickness Question 5: Disadvantages: Glass was ___________ 20% of glass rubbed away Machines were expensive Keywords for the question: disadvantages, 20, rubbed away, machines, expensive, Again, the answer is found in paragraph no. 2 in lines 4-6, “. .. . but the rollers would leave both sides of the glass marked, and these would then need to be ground and polished. This part of the process rubbed away around 20 percent of the glass, and the machines were very expensive”. So, the answer is: marked Questions 6-8: (Labeling a diagram) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to label a diagram with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS from the passage. Keywords are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. However, we should not be surprised if the sequence is not maintained. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Here is the diagram with the title: Pilkington’s float process To answer a diagram, we need to understand the concept of a diagram. In this diagram, we have to fill in the gaps for the model of Pilkington’s float process. In paragraph no. 3 we find the explanation of ‘Pilkington’s float process’. Let’s take a look: “The float process for making flat glass was invented by Alistair Pilkington. This process allows the manufacture of clear, tinted and coated glass for buildings, and clear and tinted glass for vehicles. Pilkington had been experimenting with improving the melting process, and in 1952 he had the idea of using a bed of molten metal to form the flat glass, eliminating altogether the need for rollers within the float bath. The metal had to melt at a temperature less than the hardening point of glass (about 600°C), but could not boil at a temperature below the temperature of the molten glass (about 1500°C). The best metal for the job was tin.” Then, in paragraph no. 4 we find further explanation of ‘Pilkington’s float process’ and we find all answers for the diagram in this paragraph. Take a close look at lines 2-6, “Consequently, when pouring molten glass onto the molten tin, the underside of the glass would also be perfectly flat. If the glass were kept hot enough, it would flow over the molten tin until the top surface was also flat, horizontal and perfectly parallel to the bottom surface. Once the glass cooled to 604°C or less it was too hard to mark and could be transported out of the cooling zone by rollers. So, for question no. 6, the answer has to be glass/ molten glass. (The picture indicates that molten glass is poured on the float bath.) Then, for question no. 7, the answer is molten metal/tin. (The picture indicates that molten glass is poured on the float bath which is made from some material that could not boil below 1500°C). And, for question no. 8, the answer is rollers. (The picture indicates that two small wheels helps to transport the molten glass from the float bath’s melting zone to cooling zone). So, the answers are: (molten) glass (molten) metal/tin rollers Questions 9-13: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 9: The metal used in the float process had to have specific properties. Keywords for this question: metal, float process, specific properties, In paragraph no. 3, in lines 5-7, the author describes the Pilkington’s float process, “The metal had to melt at a temperature less than the hardening point of glass (about 600°C), but could not boil at a temperature below the temperature of the molten glass (about 1500°C). The best metal for the job was tin.” The lines clearly indicate that float process required a specific metal which was tin. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 10: Pilkington invested some of his own money in his float plant. Keywords for this question: Pilkington, invested, own money, float plant, In paragraph no. 5, the writer only mentions, “Pilkington built a pilot plant in 1953 and by 1955 he had convinced his company to build a full-scale plant.” However, there is no indication of whether he invested some of his own money on that project. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 11: Pilkington’s first full-scale plant was an instant commercial success. Keywords for this question: first full-scale plant, instant commercial success, In paragraph no. 5 the author says, “Pilkington built a pilot plant in 1953 and by 1955 he had convinced his company to build a full-scale plant. However, it took 14 months of non-stop production, costing the company £100,000 a month, before the plant produced any usable glass. Furthermore, once they succeeded in making marketable flat glass, the machine was turned off for a service to prepare it for years of continuous production. When it started up again it took another four months to get the process right again. They finally succeeded in 1959. …” So, the plant was built in 1953 but it became successful in 1959, after 6 years. Therefore, it was not an instant or immediate success. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 12: The process invented by Pilkington has now been improved. Keywords for this question: process, invented by Pilkington, improved, For this question, you need to compare the original Pilkington process which is explained in paragraph no. 3 and 4 with the modern Pilkington process which is explained in paragraph no. 6. You’ll find a number of improvements in the modern Pilkington process including refining, homogenizing, continuous melting process etc. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 13: Computers are better than humans at detecting faults in glass. Keywords for this question: Computers, better, humans, detecting, faults in glass, The last few lines of paragraph no. 7 gives us the answer, “Inspection technology allows more than 100 million measurements a second to be made across the ribbon, locating flaws the unaided eye would be unable to see. Secondly, it enables computers downstream to steer cutters around flaws.” This means computers can detect such faults in glass that naked eyes of human cannot detect. So, the answer is: TRUE Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: The Little Ice Age Questions 14-17 (List of headings): [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc.).

They are the deeply important context for the current unprecedented global warming”. The lines suggest that the climate events of the Little Ice Age are very important or relevant for the modern world / current state of global warming. So, the answer is: ii (The relevance of the Little Ice Age today) Question 15: Paragraph D Take a look at the first sentence of paragraph D is: “This book is a narrative history of climate shifts during the past ten centuries.” Here, ten centuries means a thousand years, narrative history means study, So, the answer is: vii (A study covering a thousand years) Do you need Cambridge IELTS Series 8?

Question 16: Paragraph E Take a look at the last sentence of paragraph E states: “The increased productivity from farmland made some countries self-sufficient in grain and livestock and offered effective protection against famine”. The lines clearly indicate that some countries now have enough food to tackle famine, thanks to the productivity from farmland. Here, self-sufficient = adequate to survive from their own resources, grain and livestock = foods and animals such as cows, sheep, horse, buffalos, buffalos, goats, etc. So, the answer is: ix (Enough food at last) Question 17: Paragraph F In general, paragraph F deals with how present human civilization is responsible for different types of problems that have affected our climate. For instance, we can find the reference of the famine caused by the Irish potato blight (lines 2-4), deforestation because of intensive farming (lines 4-5), and the rise in temperature because of excessive use of fossil fuel (lines 9-10). All these activities are done by humans and it has affected the climate seriously. So, the answer is: iv (Human impact on the climate) Questions 18-22 (Completing summary with list of words) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete a summary with list of words taken from the passage. Candidates must write the correct letter (not the words) as the answers. Keywords and synonyms are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Title of the summary: Weather during the Little Ice Age Question 18 and 19: Documentation of past weather conditions is limited: our main sources of knowledge of conditions in the distant past are 18. ________ and 19. _________. Keywords for this question: documentation, past weather conditions, limited, main source of knowledge, In paragraph C the writer talks about how limited the documentation of the past weather is. In lines 1-2 the writer says, “Reconstructing the climate changes of the past is extremely difficult, because systematic weather observations began only a few centuries ago. . . .” Then, in lines 4-5, the writer says, “For the time before records began, we have only ‘proxy records’ reconstructed largely from tree rings and ice cores, . … ..” Here, For the time before records began = distant past, So, the answers are: (in either order) C (tree rings) B (ice cores) Question 20: We can deduce that the Little Ice Age was a time of ________, rather than of consistent freezing. Keywords for this question: Little Ice Age, time of, rather than, consistent freezing, For this question, we need to go back a little bit to paragraph B first, in lines 6-7. Here, the author says, “. . . The little Ice Age was far from a deep freeze, however; rather an irregular seesaw of rapid climatic shifts, few lasting more than a quarter-century, . . ..”. Now, in paragraph C, the writer says in the first line, “This book is a narrative history of climatic shifts during the past ten centuries, . . . .” Here, far from a deep freeze = rather than of consistent freezing So, the book shows that The Little Ice Age was, in fact, a time of climatic shifts. So, the answer is: A (climatic shifts) Question 21 22: Within it there were some periods of very cold winters, others of 21. _________ and heavy rain, and yet others that saw 22. _________ with no rain at all. Keywords for this question: some periods, very cold winters, others of, heavy rain, As paragraph B (lines 6-7) gave us the answer for question no. 20, we need look for the answer of this question in paragraph B. In lines 9-13, “The seesaw brought cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly winds; then switched abruptly to years of heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent Atlantic storms, or to periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and summer heat waves.” So, the answers are: H (storms) G (heat waves) Questions 23-26 (Classifying events to periods) [In this kind of questions, candidates are asked to classify different events to their occurring periods and write the correct letters corresponding to the answers.] Question 23: Many Europeans started farming abroad. Keywords for this question: Many Europeans, farming, abroad, In paragraph F The author explains in the very beginning, “Global temperature began to rise slowly after 1850, with the beginning of the Modern Warm Period. There was a vast migration from Europe by land-hungry farmers and others, to which the famine caused by the Irish potato blight contributed. . .. .” Here, a vast migration from Europe by land-hungry farmers and others = Europeans started farming abroad, So, the answer is: C (Modern Warm Period) Question 24: The cutting down of trees began to affect the climate. Keywords for this question: cutting down of trees, affect the climate, In paragraph F, the writer explains in lines 5-7, “. . . Millions of hectares of forest and woodland fell before the newcomers’ axes between 1850 and 1890, as intensive European farming methods expanded across the world. The unprecedented land clearance released vast quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, triggering for the first time humanly caused global warming.” Here, Millions of hectares of forest and woodland fell and unprecedented land clearance = the cutting down of trees, So, the answer is: C (Modern Warm Period) Question 25: Europeans discovered other lands. Keywords for this question: Europeans, discovered, other lands, In paragraph D, the author says in lines 2-5, “.. .. . Part one describes the Medieval Warm Period, roughly 900 to 1200. During these three centuries, Norse voyagers from Northern Europe explored northern seas, settled Greenland, and visited North America.” So, the answer is: A (Medieval Warm Period) Question 26: Changes took place in fishing patterns. Keywords for this question: Changes, fishing patterns, Have a careful look at lines 9-12 of paragraph E, which talks about the Little Ice Age, “Dried cod and herring were already staples of the European fish trade, but changes in water temperature forced fishing fleets to work further offshore. The Basques, Dutch and English developed the first offshore fishing boats adapted to a colder and stormier Atlantic…” This means the boats were redesigned for the change in fishing practice in the Atlantic. So, the answer is: B (Little Ice Age) Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: The meaning and power of smell Questions 27-32 (List of headings): [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph which will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence. ] Question 27: Paragraph A The third and last lines of paragraph A give us the answer, Third line: “… It became apparent that smell can evoke strong emotional responses.” Last lines: “. . . The perception of smell, therefore, consists not only of the sensation of the odours themselves, but of the experiences and emotions associated with them”. Here, strong emotional responses and experiences and emotions = feelings, associated with them = relationship, So, the answer is: viii (The relationship between smell and feelings) Question 28: Paragraph B Take a look at lines no. 1-4, “Odours are also essential cues in social bonding. One respondent to the survey believed that there is no true emotional bonding without touching and smelling a loved one. In fact, infants recognise the odours of their mothers soon after birth and adults can often identify their children or spouses by scent.. . .. .. . .” Here, infants recognise the odours of their mothers soon after birth = personal relationship So, the answer is: ii (The role of smell in personal relationship) Question 29: Paragraph C The first few lines give us the answer, “In spite of its importance to our emotional and sensory lives, smell is probably the most undervalued sense in many cultures. The reason often given for the low regard in which smell is held is that, in comparison with its importance among animals, the human sense of smell is feeble and undeveloped.” Here, smell is probably the most undervalued sense = sense of smell is not appreciated So, the answer is: vi (Why our sense of smell is not appreciated) Do you need Cambridge IELTS Series 8? Click here! Question 30: Paragraph D In paragraph D, again, the first few lines provide us with the answer, “Odours, unlike colours, for instance, cannot be named in many languages because the specific vocabulary simply doesn’t exist.” The lines suggest that there are difficulties to describe smell verbally. Here, the specific vocabulary simply doesn’t exist = difficulties of talking about smells So, the answer is: i (The difficulties of talking about smells) Question 31: Paragraph E Lines 3-5 of paragraph E give hint to our answer, “ . . . .. but many fundamental questions have yet to be answered. Researchers have still to decide whether smell is one sense or two – one responding to odours proper and the other registering odourless chemicals in the air.” Here, Researchers have still to decide = Future studies So, the answer is: iii (Future studies into smell) Question 32: Paragraph F In paragraph F, we can find out that the author provides a link between cultures and smell in lines 8-9, “Importantly, our commonly held feelings about smells can help distinguish us from other cultures”. This line suggests that smell or odour can be exercised as a factor to define one person/culture from another. Here, define = distinguish, groups = other cultures, So, the answer is: v (The interpretation of smells as a factor in defining groups) Questions 33-36: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers for previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question 33: According to the introduction, we become aware of the importance of smell when – Keywords for this question: introduction, aware, importance of smell, when, The last lines of the introduction give us the answer for this question, “It is only when the faculty of smell is impaired for some reason that we begin to realise the essential role the sense of smell plays in our sense of well-being.” This means we become aware of the importance of smell when this faculty is impaired or damaged. So, the answer is: C (our ability to smell is damaged) Question 34: The experiment described in paragraph B – Keywords for this question: experiment, paragraph B, Read the last half part of paragraph B, “ . .. In one well-known test, women and men were able to distinguish by smell alone clothing worn by their marriage partners from similar clothing worn by other people. Most of the subjects would probably never have given much thought to odour as a cue for identifying family members before being involved in the test, but as the experiment revealed, even when not consciously considered, smells register.” This means the experiment shows how our sense of smell is in use even though we don’t realise it. So, the answer is: A (shows how we make use of smell without realising it) Question 35: What is the writer doing in paragraph C? Keywords for this question: writer doing, paragraph C, The common belief is given in lines 1-4, “.. . .. . smell is probably the most undervalued sense in many cultures. The reason often given for the low regard in which smell is held is that, in comparison with its importance among animals, the human sense of smell is feeble and undeveloped.” This means smell is extremely undervalued. Then, in the next few lines, “.. . .. While it is true that the olfactory powers of humans are nothing like as fine as those possessed by certain animals, they are still remarkably acute. Our noses are able to recognise thousands of smells, and to perceive odours which are present only in extremely small quantities.” Here, the writer discards the common belief about the undervalued sense of smell. So, the answer is: C (rejecting a common belief) Question 36: What does the writer suggest about the study of smell in the atmosphere in paragraph E? Keywords for this question: writer suggest, study of smell, atmosphere, paragraph E, In lines 3-4, we have our answer for this question, “ . . . but many fundamental questions have yet to be answered.

Keywords for this question: can help, recognise, belonging to, husbands and wives, In paragraph B, take a look at lines, “In one well-known test, women and men were able to distinguish by smell alone clothing worn by their marriage partners from similar clothing worn by other people”. This means that the special smell in clothing worn by husbands or wives can be used to recognize their marriage partners. Here, odours = smell, recognize = distinguish, their husbands and wives = their marriage partners, So, the answer is: clothing Question 38: Certain linguistic groups may have difficulty describing smell because they lack the appropriate __________. Keywords for this question: Certain linguistic groups, have difficulty, describing smell, lack, appropriate, In paragraph D, the lines 1-4 say, “Odours, unlike colors, for instance, cannot be named in many languages because the specific vocabulary simply does not exist. “It smells like . . .” we have to say when describing an odour, struggling to express our olfactory experience”. The lines suggest that it is quite hard for people to talk about smells because of the lack of specific vocabulary in their languages. Here, linguistic groups = languages, lack = does not exist, So, the answer is: vocabulary Question 39: The sense of smell may involve response to _________ which do not smell, in addition to obvious odours. Keywords for this question: sense of smell, involve, and do not smell, Take a look at paragraph E. In lines 4-5 the writer says, “Researchers have still to decide whether smell is one sense or two – one responding to odours proper and the other registering odourless chemicals in the air.” Therefore, it can be understood that chemicals are the things which do not smell in the air. Here, do not smell = odourless, So, the answer is: chemicals Question 40: Odours regarded as unpleasant in certain ________ are not regarded as unpleasant in others. Keywords for this question: unpleasant, regarded as, not unpleasant in others, In paragraph F, read the following lines, “Odours are invested with cultural values: smells that are considered to be offensive in some cultures may be perfectly acceptable in others”. The lines suggest that certain smells may be acceptable in some cultures, but in other cultures they are not acceptable. Here, unpleasant = offensive, regarded as = considered, not unpleasant = acceptable, So, the answer is: cultures",

Keywords for the question: advantage, technique, Diels, can be used, In paragraph no. 5, lines 2-4 say, “. …. .. points out Jean-Claude Diels of the University of New Mexico. Diels is leading a project, which is backed by EPRI, to try to use lasers to discharge lightning safely- and safety is a basic requirement since no one wants to put themselves or their expensive equipment at risk.” So, the answer is: safely (you must use the adverb form of the noun ‘safety’) Question 6: The main difficulty associated with using the laser equipment is related to its ____________. Keywords for the question: main difficulty, using the laser equipment, related to, In paragraph no. 7, the writer talks about the main problem related to the laser equipment. “However, there is still a big stumbling block. The laser is no nifty portable: it’s a monster that takes up a whole room. Diels is trying to cut down the size and says that a laser around the size of a small table is in the offing.” Here, big stumbling block = main difficulty, it’s a monster that takes up a whole room = size, So, the answer is: size Questions 7-10: (Completing summary with list of words) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete a summary with list of words taken from the passage. Candidates must write the correct letter (not the words) as the answers. Keywords and synonyms are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Question no. 7: In this method, a laser is used to create a line of ionisation by removing electrons from __________. Keywords for the question: laser, used, create, a line of ionisation, removing electrons from, In paragraph no. 6, the author of the passage writes in lines 1-4, “The idea began some 20 years ago, when high-powered lasers were revealing their ability to extract electrons out of atoms and create ions. If a laser could generate a line of ionisation. .. ..” Here, generate a line of ionisation = create a line of ionisation, removing electrons from = extract electrons out of, So, the answer is: B (atoms) Question no. 8 and 9: This laser is then directed at 8. __________ in order to control electrical charges, a method which is less dangerous than using 9. __________. Keywords for the question: laser, directed, control electrical charges, a method, less dangerous than, Again, in paragraph no. 6, carefully look at lines 2-3, “If a laser could generate a line of ionisation in the air all the way up to a storm cloud, this conducting path could be used to guide lightning to Earth . … . ” Now, paragraph no. 6 is an explanation of using lasers in a populated area by Jean-Claude Diels of the University of New Mexico. If you take a look at the first line of paragraph no. 5, you’ll find the reason for using lasers, “And anyway, who would want to fire streams of rockets in a populated area?” This means lasers are less dangerous than rockets. So, the answers are: C (storm clouds) G (rockets) Question no. 10: As a protection for the lasers, the beams are aimed firstly at __________. Keywords for the question: protection, for the lasers, beams, aimed firstly, For this question, we have to look at lines 5-6 of paragraph no.6, “. . .. To stop the laser itself being struck, it would not be pointed straight at the clouds. Instead it would be directed at a mirror and from there into the sky”. So, mirrors will give the much needed protection for the lasers. Here, directed at = aimed . . . at, So, the answer is: D (mirrors) Questions 11-13: YES, NO, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the claims of the writer in the passage – YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claims of the writer in the passage – NO If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 11: Power companies have given Diels enough money to develop his laser. Keywords for this question: power companies, given, Diels, enough money, to develop his laser, In paragraph no. 8 the writer says in lines 1-3, “Bernstein says that Diels’s system is attracting lots of interest from the power companies. But they have not yet come up with the 5 million dollars that EPRI says will be needed to develop a commercial system…”. This means even though power companies are fascinated by Diels’s system, they have not yet provided him with the money that he needs. So, the answer is: NO Question 12: Obtaining money to improve the lasers will depend on tests in real storms. Keywords for this question: obtaining money, improve the lasers, depend on, tests, real storm, In paragraph no. 8, lines 3-6 the author says, “He reckons that the forthcoming field test will be the turning point – and he’s hoping for good news. Bernstein predicts ‘an avalanche of interest and support’ if all goes well. He expects to see cloud – zappers eventually costing 50,000 dollars to 100,000 dollars each.” Here, the forthcoming field test will be the turning point indicates that the coming tests in real storms will determine whether he will obtain the money or not. So, the answer is: YES Question 13: Weather forecasters are intensely interested in Diels’s system. Keywords for this question: Weather forecasters, intensely interested, Diels’s system, We find the mention of ‘meteorology’ in both paragraph no. 9 and 10. However, neither of the paragraphs indicates anything about weather forecasters’ interest in Diels’s system. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: The Nature of Genius Questions 14-18 (Choosing from list of factors): [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of factors with a question. Candidates must find out three/four or five factors that matches with the questions. Most of the time, the answers can be found in one or two paragraphs. TIPS: Both skimming and scanning are needed for this kind of question. You need to skim the passage to find out the paragraph where the answers can be found. Then you can scan it to find all the answers. The answers can be written in any order.] Question for 14-18: Below are listed some popular beliefs about genius and giftedness. Which FIVE of these beliefs are reported by the writer of the text? For this question, we have to find out the paragraph where popular beliefs about genius and giftedness are reported. A quick skimming of paragraph A indicates that the answers can’t be found there. Now, in paragraph B, take a look at lines 2-3, “. . .In the mythology of giftedness. . ..” Here, mythology = popular beliefs. Now, let’s match the answers: In lines 4-5, “.. . .. that intellectuals are impractical, that prodigies burn too brightly too soon and burn out, … ..”. Here, prodigies = gifted people/genius people, burn out = exhausted, This information matches with the answer B. In lines 10-11, “… . that people with gifts have a responsibility to use them. . . ”. Here, have a responsibility = should, use them = use their gifts, This information matches with the answer C. In lines 6-7, “… . that genius runs in families. . . ”. Here, genius runs in families = Genius is inherited, This information matches with the answer F. In line no. 9, “… . that genius goes unrecognized and unrewarded. . . ”. Here, genius goes unrecognized and unrewarded = People never appreciate true genius, This information matches with the answer H. In line no. 10, “… . that adversity makes men wise . . . ”. Here, adversity = difficulties, develop their greatness = makes men wise, This information matches with the answer J. The other options such as A, D, E, G, I, K, do not match with the information provided in paragraph B. So the answers are: (in any order) B C F H J Do you need Cambridge IELTS Series 8? Click here! Questions 19-26 (TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN) In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 19: Nineteenth-century studies of the nature of genius failed to take into account the uniqueness of the person’s upbringing. Keywords for this question: Nineteenth-century studies, failed to take into account, uniqueness, person’s upbringing, We find the reference of 19th century studies in paragraph no. 3. Now, take a look at lines 7-9, “. . However, the difficulty with the evidence produced by these studies, fascinating as they are in collecting together anecdotes and apparent similarities and exceptions, is that they are not what we would today call norm-referenced.” Here, norm-referenced means followed by a fixed principle. Here, the principle is to maintain standard in upbringing a genius person, which was not maintained properly as “. … the cases studied were members of the privileged classes” (line no. 16). Therefore, the information matches with the question. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 20: Nineteenth-century studies of genius lacked both objectivity and a proper scientific approach. Keywords for this question: Nineteenth-century studies, lacked, objectivity, proper scientific approach, The last sentence of paragraph no. 3 points us to the answer, “It was only with the growth of paediatrics and psychology in the twentieth century that studies could be carried out on a more objective, if still not always very scientific, basis.” This sentence directly indicates that 19th century studies on genius could not be conducted on an objective basis and that scientific approach was not so proper. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 21: A true genius has general powers capable of excellence in any area. Keywords for this question: true genius, general powers, excellence in any area, Let’s have a look at paragraph no. 4 for this question’s answer. In lines 9-10, the writer gives reference to Dr. Samuel Johnson’s observation, “ ‘The true genius is a mind of large general powers, accidentally determined to particular direction’. We may disagree with the ‘general’, for we doubt if all musicians of genius could have become scientists of genius or vice versa, …. ..” This means a genius person does not have general powers which make him or her capable of excellence in any area; otherwise musicians could easily be become scientists. So, the information is contradictory to the question. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 22: The skills of ordinary individuals are in essence the same as the skills of prodigies. Keywords for this question: skills, ordinary individuals, in essence, same, prodigies, Take a look at lines 1-2 of paragraph no. 5, “.. …the achievements of prodigies are the manifestations of skills or abilities which are similar to, but also much superior to, our own.” Here, are similar to = the same as Remember, the line means that the skills of ordinary people are mainly the same as the genius people, only genius people can use them in a superior way. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 23: The ease with which truly great ideas are accepted and taken for granted fails to lessen their significance. Keywords for this question: ease, truly great ideas, accepted and taken for granted, fails, lessen, significance, In paragraph no. 5, in lines 4-8, the writer illustrates that “. .. .the hard-won discoveries of scientists like Kepler or Einstein become the commonplace knowledge of schoolchildren and the colours of an artist like Paul Klee so soon appear on the fabrics we wear. This does not minimise the supremacy of their achievements….” Here, This does not = fails, lessen = minimize, commonplace knowledge = the ease, Therefore, great ideas (hard-won discoveries) are accepted and taken for granted means that even schoolchildren can learn them. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 24: Giftedness and genius deserve proper scientific research into their true nature so that all talent may be retained for the human race. Keywords for this question: Giftedness and genius, deserve, proper scientific research, true nature, all talent, retained for the human race, In the passage we do not find any information regarding what genius really is, in order for all talent to be retained. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 25: Geniuses often pay a high price to achieve greatness. Keywords for this question: Geniuses, often, pay, high price, achieve greatness, In paragraph 6, lines 7-10, the writer talks about what genius people have to go through to achieve greatness, “We may envy their achievements and fame, but we should also recognise the price they may have paid in terms of perseverance, single-mindedness, dedication, restrictions on their personal lives, the demands upon their energies and time, and how often they had to display great courage to preserve their integrity or to make their way to the top.” This means genius people have to pay a great price to reach the top of their success. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 26: To be a genius is worth the high personal cost. Keywords for this question: to be a genius, worth, high personal cost, In paragraph 6, the writer mentions about the high price that genius people may have paid to achieve greatness. However, we find no reference to whether all the personal costs, restrictions on their personal lives, demands on their time, dedication, energy and all other matters, are quite worthy of becoming a genius.” So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: How does the biological clock tick? Questions 27-32 (List of headings): [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph which will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question 27: Paragraph B Look at lines 1-6 first, the writer talks about the ageing of ‘dead’ products/ objects and that of organisms, “Our ‘dead’ products are ‘static’, closed systems. It is always the basic material which constitutes the object and which, in the natural course of things, is worn down and becomes ‘older’. Ageing in this case must occur according to the laws for a living organism, the result of this law is not inexorable in the same way. At least as long as a biological system has the ability to renew itself it could actually become older without ageing; .. .. .” Therefore, it can be clearly understood that dead objects is worn down and becomes older; for a living organism, becoming older can happen without ageing. So, the answer is: ix (Fundamental differences in ageing of objects and organisms) Do you need Cambridge IELTS Series 8? Click here! Question 28: Paragraph C The answer is in the last few lines of paragraph C, “.. .. . Because of changes in the genetic material (mutations) these have new characteristics and in the course of their individual lives they are tested for optimal or better adaptation to the environmental conditions. Immortality would disturb this system – it needs room for new and better life.. … .” The lines suggest that changes in genetic materials characterize them with new features and these new characteristics need to be tested so that organisms can adapt to the environment. If organisms don’t die, expectation of new and better life becomes impossible. So, the answer is: ii (Why dying is beneficial) Question 29: Paragraph D The answer can be found in the first few lines, “Every organism has a life span which is highly characteristic. There are striking differences in life span between different species, but within one species the parameter is relatively constant.” Here, constant = stable, but = despite, So, the answer is: vii (A stable life span despite improvements) Question 30: Paragraph E In paragraph E, again, the first few lines provide us with the answer, “If a life span is a genetically determined biological characteristic, it is logically necessary to propose the existence of an internal clock, which in some way measures and controls the ageing process and which finally determines death as the last step in a fixed programme.” This is the description of the biological clock. So, the answer is: i (The biological clock) Question 31: Paragraph F Paragraph F mainly deals with the effect of energy consumption by organisms and animals, “Animals which save energy… . .. .. live much longer than those which are always active”. We find examples of what happens to different animals like crocodiles, tortoises and birds which do not use much energy. Then we find comparisons on women and men who use different levels of energy. So, the answer is: viii (Energy consumption) Question 32: Paragraph G The first line of paragraph G gives us the answer, “It follows from the above that sparing use of energy reserves should tend to extend life.” Here, extend = prolong, So, the answer is: iv (Prolonging your life) Questions 33-36: (Completing notes) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete different notes with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS from the passage. Keywords are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. However, we should not be surprised if the sequence is not maintained. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Question 33 34: Objects age in accordance with principles of 33. ________ and of 34. _________ Keywords for this question: objects, age, principles of, The answers lie in paragraph B. In lines 3-4, the writer talks about the ageing of objects, “. . .Ageing in this case (case of objects) must occur according to the laws of physical chemistry and thermodynamics.” Here, the laws = principles, So, the answers are: physical chemistry thermodynamics Question 35: Through mutations, organisms can ________ better to the environment Keywords for this question: through mutations, organisms, better, environment, In paragraph C, take a look at lines 6-8, “Because of changes in the genetic material (which means mutations) these (which means organisms) have new characteristics and in the course of their individual lives they are tested for optimal or better adaptation to the environmental conditions”. Here, for the question, we cannot write ‘adaptation’ as our answer. The question has a modal verb ‘can’ for which our answer had to be a main verb. The verb for ‘adaptation’ is ‘adapt’. So, the answer is: adapt Question 36: ________ would pose a serious problem for the theory of evolution Keywords for this question: pose a serious problem, theory of evolution, In paragraph C, take a look at the last line: “Immortality would disturb this system – it needs room for new and better life. This is the basic problem of evolution”. Here, disturb this system = pose a serious problem, So, the answer is: Immortality Questions 37-40 (YES, NO, NOT GIVEN) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN] [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 37: The wear and tear theory applies to both artificial objects and biological systems. Keywords for this question: wear and tear theory, artificial objects and biological systems, In paragraph A line no. 3-4, the writer talks about ‘the wear and tear theory’, “. . .. products which are subjected to natural wear and tear during use.” Then, in the end of this paragraph, the writer raises a big question on whether the theory applies to both living things and artificial objects, “. . .But are the wear and tear and loss of function of technical objects and the death of living organisms really similar or comparable?” Here, the raised question gives us the indication that the theory does not apply to both. So, the answer is: NO Question 38: In principle, it is possible for a biological system to become older without ageing. Keywords for this question: principle, possible, biological system, become older without ageing, In paragraph B, take a look at lines 6-7, “ . . . . At least as long as a biological system has the ability to renew itself it could actually become older without ageing; … ..” The sentence is a clear match with the question. So, the answer is: YES Question 39: Within seven years, about 90 per cent of a human body is replaced as new. Keywords for this question: seven years, 90 per cent of human body, replaced as new, In this passage, we don’t find any reference to seven years or 90 percent. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 40: Conserving energy may help to extend a human’s life. Keywords for this question: conserving energy, extend, life, In paragraph G, the very first lines give us the answer for this question, “It follows from the above that sparing use of energy reserves should tend to extend life.” Here, conserving energy = sparing use of energy reserves, The sentence is a clear match with the question. So, the answer is: YES",

The writer gives a description of the number of years, the different facilities, timing of lessons, break-time and description of the class-size, etc. So, the answer is: vii (Background to middle-years education in Japan) Special tips: Most of the time in ‘List of headings/Matching headings’ questions, the answers are found from the first few lines as they give an idea about the main topic. However, this is not applicable to all questions, so sometimes you need to skim the whole section/paragraph. Do you need Cambridge IELTS Series 8? Click here! Question 2: Section C In paragraph C, look at lines 3-4, “Everyone has their own copy of the textbook supplied by the central education authority, Monbusho, as a part of the concept of free compulsory education up to the age of 15.” Therefore, Monbusho, which is Japan’s central education authority, supplies textbooks to the students for free. Again, the last sentence in paragraph C says, “Besides approving textbooks, Monbusho also decides the highly centralized national curriculum and how it is to be delivered”. These lines suggest that Monbusho has such a great effect/influence on Japan’s education that it not only designs textbooks but also the national curriculum. So, the answer is: i (The influence of Monbusho) Question 3: Section D This section describes the format of every lesson in Monbusho system. However, it seems that none of the ‘headings’ from the list matches with this section. Again, if you look at lines 11-12, the author writes, “. .. Only rarely are supplementary worksheets distributed in a maths class.” This means supplementary worksheets are rarely distributed in maths class only, and this makes maths class format typical. So, the answer is: v (The typical format of a maths lesson) Question 4: Section E In the first part of section E, the writer says lines 3-4, “. .. In observed lessons, any strugglers would be assisted by the teacher or quietly seek help from their neighbour.” Here, strugglers mean less successful students. Then, in the next part of section E, the author says, “This scarcely seems adequate help to enable slow learners to keep up. However, the Japanese attitude towards education runs along the lines of ‘if you work hard enough, you can do almost anything’.” This means slow learners get help which may seem inadequate but Japanese people believe hard work essential to get success. So, the answer is: ii (Helping less successful students) Question 5: Section F The first lines of parts 1 and 2 of section F give us the answer to this question. At the beginning of part 1, “So what are the major contributing factors in the success of maths teaching? Clearly, attitudes are important.” And then, at the beginning of part 2, “Other relevant points relate to the supportive attitude of a class towards slower pupils, the lack of competition within a class and a positive emphasis on learning for oneself and improving one’s own standard.” So, the answer is: viii (The key to Japanese successes in maths education) Questions 6-9: YES, NO, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the claims of the writer in the passage – YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claims of the writer in the passage – NO If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 6: There is a wider range of achievement amongst English pupils studying maths than amongst their Japanese counterparts. Keywords for the question: wider range of achievement, English pupils, studying maths, Japanese counterparts, In paragraph A, take a look at lines 4-6, where the writer says, “… .. . but there was also a larger proportion of ‘low’ attainers in England, where, incidentally, the variation in attainment scores was much greater.” The lines suggest that even though Japan has a much better record in average mathematical achievement than England and Wales, England has a much wider range of achievement scores than Japan. Here, wider means greater, achievement means attainment, So, the answer is: YES Question no. 7: The percentage of Gross National Product spent on education generally reflects the level of attainment in mathematics. Keywords for the question: percentage, Gross National Product, spent, reflects, level of attainment, Take a look at the last sentence of Section A,”. .. . The percentage of Gross National Product spent on education is reasonably similar in the two countries, so how is this higher and more consistent attainment in maths achieved?” Now have a look at the sentence of section A, “Japan has significantly better record in terms of average mathematical attainment than England and Wales.” Therefore, the writer is asking the question about the role of GNP in relation to higher scores in maths by Japan. This suggests that the percentage of GNP spent on education doesn’t necessarily reflect the level of scoring in maths. Had it been like that, England would have the same result in maths like Japan. So, the answer is: NO Question no. 8: Private schools in Japan are more modern and spacious than state-run lower secondary schools. Keywords for the question: private schools in Japan, modern, spacious, state-run lower secondary schools, In section B, the writer indicates in lines 2-3, “. .. . all pupils at this stage attend state schools; only 3 percent are in the private sector. Schools are usually modern in design, set well back from the road and spacious inside”. However, we don’t find any comparison between the facilities of private schools and state-run schools here. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 9: Teachers mark homework in Japanese schools. Keywords for the question: teachers, mark, homework, Japanese schools, In section D, take a look at lines 3-5, “Pupils mark their own homework: this is an important principle in Japanese schooling as it enables pupils to see where and why they made a mistake so that these can be avoided in future”. So, the homework is marked by the pupils, not by their teachers. So, the answer is: NO Questions 10-13: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question no. 10: Maths textbooks in Japanese schools are – Keywords for the question: Maths textbooks, Japanese schools, In section C, find this line, “These textbooks are, on the whole, small, presumably inexpensive to produce, but well set out and logically developed.” Here, well set out and logically developed = well organised and adapted to the needs of the pupils So, the answer is: B (Well organised and adapted to the needs of the pupils) Question 11: When a new maths topic is introduced, Keywords for this question: new maths topic, introduced, In section D, the writer says in lines 7-10, “…. the teacher explains the topic of the lesson, slowly and with a lot of repetition and elaboration. Examples are demonstrated on the board; questions from the textbook are worked through first with the class….”. This means that the teacher patiently explains any new maths topic with repetition and elaborates on the topic to the students so that they can understand it easily. So, the answer is: C (It is carefully and patiently explained to the students) Question 12: How do schools deal with students who experience difficulties? Keywords for this question: schools, deal with, students, experience difficulties, In section E, the author of the text says in lines 2-5, “. .. . . Teachers say that they give individual help at the end of a lesson or after school, setting extra work if necessary. In observed lessons, any strugglers would be assisted by the teacher or quietly seek help from their neighbour”. Furthermore, the schools also inspire the parents and guardians to help as the writer explains in lines 10-13, “. .. . .. Parents are kept closely informed of their children’s progress and will play a part in helping their children to keep up with class, sending them to ‘Juku’ (private evening tuition) if extra help is needed and encouraging them to work harder”. This means the students are encouraged to take extra lessons in ‘Juku’ (supplementary tuition) So, the answer is: A (They are given appropriate supplementary tuition) Question 13: Why do Japanese students tend to achieve relatively high rates of success in maths? Keywords for this question: Japanese students, tend to achieve, relatively high rates of success, maths, In section F, the writer says in lines 3-4, “.. . .. . maths is recognised as an important compulsory subject throughout schooling, and the emphasis is on hard work coupled with a focus on accuracy.” This means Japanese students and teachers give more importance to hard work and accuracy in maths and as a result, the students get relatively high scores in maths. Here, hard work = effort, accuracy = correct answers, So, the answer is: C (Much effort is made and correct answers are emphasised) Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Biological control of pests Questions 14-17: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question 14: The use of pesticides has contributed to – Keywords for this question: use of pesticides, contributed to, In paragraph no. 1, the writer says in lines 2-4, “.. . Apart from engendering widespread ecological disorders, pesticides have contributed to the emergence of a new breed of chemical-resistant, highly lethal superbugs. .” Here, around the world = widespread, imbalance = disorders, So, the answer is: B (an imbalance in many ecologies around the world.) Do you need Cambridge IELTS Series 8? Click here! Question 15: The Food and Agriculture Organisation has counted more than 300 agricultural pests which – Keywords for this question: The Food and Agriculture Organisation, counted, more than 300, agricultural pests, In paragraph no. 2, lines 1-2, the writer says, “According to a recent study by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), more than 300 species of agricultural pests have developed resistance to a wide range of potent chemicals”. This means that pesticides are no longer effective on these 300 species of agricultural pests. Here, no longer responding to = have developed resistance to, pesticides = potent chemicals So, the answer is: A (are no longer responding to most pesticides in use.) Question 16: Cotton farmers in Central America began to use pesticides – Keywords for this question: Cotton farmers, Central America, began, use pesticides, We find the reference of ‘Cotton farmers’ in paragraph no. 4. In lines 1-4, the author says, “. . .. . well illustrated by what happened to cotton farmers in Central America. In the early 1940s, basking in the glory of chemical-based intensive agriculture, the farmers avidly took to pesticides as a sure measure to boost crop yield.” Here, began to use = took to, boost = to make something increase So, the answer is: D (to ensure more cotton was harvested from each crop) Question 17: By the mid-1960s, cotton farmers in Central America found that pesticides – Keywords for this question: mid-1960s, cotton farmers, Central America, found, pesticides, In paragraph no. 5, the author says in the beginning, “By the mid-1960s, the situation took an alarming turn with the outbreak of four more new pests, necessitating pesticides spraying to such an extent that 50% of the financial outlay on cotton production was accounted for by pesticides”. This means that pesticides accounted for 50% of the amount of money spent on cotton production. Here, financial outlay = the money that need to be spent in order to produce cotton, So, the answer is: D (were costing 50% of the total amount they spent on their crops) Questions 18-21 YES, NO, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the claims of the writer in the passage – YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claims of the writer in the passage – NO If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 18: Disease-spreading pests respond more quickly to pesticides than agricultural pests do. Keywords for this question: disease-spreading pests, respond, more quickly, pesticides, agricultural pests, In paragraph 2, we find a statement made by the FAO, “. . .. . more than 300 species of agricultural pests have developed resistance to a wide range of potent chemicals. Not to be left behind are the disease-spreading pests, about 100 species of which have become immune to a variety of insecticides now in use”. In this statement, the writer talks about the response by different pests to different pesticides. However, we find no comparison on any pests responding more quickly or less quickly than other pests. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 19: A number of pests are now born with an innate immunity to some pesticides. Keywords for this question: pests, born, innate immunity, pesticides, In paragraph no. 3, the writer states in lines 3-5, “Because of their tremendous breeding potential and genetic diversity, many pests are known to withstand synthetic chemicals and bear offspring with a built-in resistance to pesticides”. The lines suggest to the fact that these species are born with an innate immunity to insecticides. Here, built-in = innate, resistance = immunity, So, the answer is: YES Question 20: Biological control entails using synthetic chemicals to try and change the genetic make-up of the pests’ offspring. Keywords for this question: biological control, synthetic chemicals, change, genetic make-up, pests’ offspring, In paragraph no. 7, the author says in lines 1-4, “In the face of the escalating perils from indiscriminate applications of pesticides, a more effective and ecologically sound strategy of biological control, involving the selective use of natural enemies of the pest population, is fast gaining popularity – though, as yet, it is a new field with limited potential.” Here, involving the selective use of natural enemies of the pest population means using natural enemies instead of using synthetic chemicals. Here, synthetic means artificial. Therefore, the question contradicts with the statement given in the passage. So, the answer is: NO Question 21: Bio-control is free from danger under certain circumstances. Keywords for this question: bio-control, free from, danger, circumstances, In paragraph 7, the writer states in lines 4-7, “. . .. . .. the advantage of biological control in contrast to other methods is that it provides a relatively low-cost, perpetual control system with a minimum of detrimental side-effects. When handled by experts, bio-control is safe, non-polluting and self-dispersing”. Here, with a minimum of detrimental side-effects = free from danger So, the answer is: YES Questions 22-26: (Completing sentences with correct endings) [For this type of question, candidates need to match the beginning and ending of sentences. Candidates need to look for keywords in the sentence-beginnings and find the relative paragraphs and then sentences in the passage. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question 22: Disapene scale insects feed on – Keywords for this question: Disapene scale insects, feed on, The last sentence in paragraph no. 9 gives us the answer to this question. The writer says here, “CIBC is also perfecting the technique for breeding parasites that prey on ‘disapene scale’ insects – notorious defoliants of fruit trees in the US and India.” The lines suggest that disapene scale insects causes harm to fruit trees, so they feed on fruit trees. Here, notorious = well known for being bad, So, the answer is: D (fruit trees) Question 23: Neodumetia sangawani ate – Keywords for this question: Neodumetia sangawani, ate, In paragraph no. 10, take a look at these lines, “Neodumetia sangawani, was found useful in controlling the Rhodes grass-scale insect that was devouring forage grass in many parts of the US.” This means that Neodumetia sangawani devoured or ate Rhodes grass-scale insect to control it from devouring forage grass. Here, ate = was devouring So, the answer is: H (grass-scale insects) Question 24: Leaf-mining hispides blighted – Keywords for this question: Leaf-mining hispides, blighted, In paragraph no. 10, the writer mentions, “In the late 1960s, when Sri Lanka’s flourishing coconut groves were plagued by leaf-mining hispides, a larval parasite imported from Singapore brought the pest under control.” This suggests the fact that Sri Lanka’s coconut groves were damaged by leaf-mining hispides. Here, blight = plague, flourishing = developing quickly or being productive, grove = a small garden or group of trees, So, the answer is: C (coconut trees) Question 25: An Argentinian weevil may be successful in wiping out – Keywords for this question: Argentinian weevil, may be, successful, wiping out, In paragraph no. 9, the author mentions, “Similarly the Hyderabad-based Regional Laboratory (RRL), supported by CIBC, is now trying out an Argentina weevil (a kind of small beetle) for the eradication of water hyacinth.” The lines suggest that an Argentinian weevil has a possibility of being successful in destroying all of the water hyacinth plants. We can guess that the weevils will eat the water hyacinth. Here, destroying = wiping out, So, the answer is: E (water hyacinth) Question 26: Salvinia molesta plagues Keywords for this question: Salvinia molesta, plagues, Again, in paragraph 10, the writer says, “By using Neochetina bruci, a beetle native to Brazil, scientists at Kerala Agricultural University freed a 12-kilometer-long canal from the clutches of the weed Salvinia molesta. About 30,000 hectares of rice fields in Kerala are infested by this weed.” Here, plagues = are infested by, So, the answer is: B (rice fields) Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: Collecting Ant Specimens Questions 27-30 (TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN) In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 27: Taxonomic research involves comparing members of one group of ants. Keywords for this question: Taxonomic research, comparing members, one group of ants, In paragraph 1, the writer says in lines 4-6, “For taxonomy, or classification, long series, from a single nest, which contain all castes (workers, including majors and minors, and, if present, queens and males) are desirable, to allow the determination of variation within species.” These lines explain that taxonomic research entails classifying different ants from a particular nest, which holds all the different castes, or different members of a single group. Here, one group of ants = a single nest, which contain all castes, So, the answer is: TRUE Question 28: New species of ant are frequently identified by taxonomists. Keywords for this question: new species, frequently, identified, by taxonomists, Only paragraph no. 1 details about taxonomic research of ants. However, no information is found here about how often/frequently taxonomists identify new species of ants. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 29: Range is the key criterion for ecological collections. Keywords for this question: Range, key criterion, ecological collections, In paragraph no. 1, the author says in lines 7-8, “For ecological studies, the most important factor is collecting identifiable samples of as many of the different species present as possible.” The lines suggest that it is absolutely vital/ important to gather a variety or range of present species. Here, as many of the different species = range, the most important factor = key criterion, So, the answer is: TRUE Question 30: A single collection of ants can generally be used for both taxonomic and ecological purposes. Keywords for this question: single collection, generally, used for, both, taxonomic, ecological purposes, The last few lines of paragraph no. 1 gives us hint to the answer, “The taxonomist sometimes overlooks whole species in favour of those groups currently under study, while the ecologist often collects only a limited number of specimens of each species, thus reducing their value for taxonomic investigations.” This means the taxonomists sometimes don’t consider a large collection (whole species) so important while ecologists often collect a very inadequate number of specimens of ever species of ants. This often makes the taxonomic investigation insignificant. Thus, a single collection cannot be used for both taxonomic and ecological purposes. So, the answer is: FALSE Do you need Cambridge IELTS Series 8? Click here!

N.B.: This question doesn’t follow any sequence. So, they should be answered after all other questions in the passage.] Question 31: It is preferable to take specimens from groups of ants. Keywords for this question: preferable, take specimens, groups of ants, In paragraph no. 2, where the author talks about hand collecting method, it says in lines 6-8, “. . .. .. when possible, collections should be made from nests or foraging columns and at least 20 to 25 individuals collected. This will ensure that all individuals are from the same species and so increase their value for detailed studies”. Here, at least 20 to 25 individuals = groups of ants, So, the answer is: A (hand collecting) Question 32: It is particularly effective for wet habitats. Keywords for this question: particularly effective, wet habitats, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 4, where the writer gives details about ground litter sampling method, “. . .. .. .this method works especially well in rain forests and marshy areas”. Rain forests and marshy areas are wet habitats. Here, works well = effective, rain forests and marshy area = wet habitats, So, the answer is: C (sampling ground litter) Question 33: It is a good method for species which are hard to find. Keywords for this question: good method, hard to find, In paragraph no. 3, where the writer details about using baits, it says, “. . . . Baits can be used to attract and concentrate foragers. This often increases the number of individuals collected and attracts species that are otherwise elusive”. Here, elusive = hard to find, So, the answer is: B (using bait) Question 34: Little time and effort is required. Keywords for this question: little time and effort, required, In paragraph no. 5, where the author explains the pitfall trap method, it says, “One advantage of pitfall traps is that they can be used to collect over a period of time with minimal maintenance and intervention”. That means pitfall traps require little time and effort to look after. Here, minimal maintenance and intervention = little time and effort, So, the answer is: D (using a pitfall trap) Question 35: Separate containers are used for individual specimens. Keywords for this question: separate containers, used, individual specimens, Again, in paragraph no. 2, where the hand collecting method is explained, the writer says in lines 11-12, “Individual insects are placed in plastic or glass tubes (1.5 – 3.0 ml capacity for small ants, 5-8 ml for larger ants) containing 75% to 95% ethanol.” Here, plastic or glass tubes = containers, So, the answer is: A (hand collecting) Question 36: Non-alcoholic preservative should be used. Keywords for this question: non-alcoholic preservatives, In paragraph no. 5, in the pitfall trap method, the writer says, “ . .. . . . .. the preservative used is usually ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, as alcohol will evaporate quickly and the traps will dry out”. Here, the writer explains the use of ethylene glycol or propylene glycol because if alcohol is used, it will evaporate and the trap will dry out quickly and will not have any effect. So, the answer is: D (using a pitfall trap) Questions 37-40 (Labeling a diagram) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to label a diagram with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS from the passage. Keywords are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. However, we should not be surprised if the sequence is not maintained. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Title: One method of collecting ants Special tips: To answer this question easily, we need to get an idea about which method of collecting ants is displayed in this diagram and find out the paragraph in the passage where the answers for questions 37-40 can be traced. In this diagram, we find only one word which seems to be our KEYWORD and the word is ‘funnel’. Therefore, we need to find out the paragraph where the word ‘funnel’ can be found. This passage has only five paragraphs and paragraphs 2 3, 4 and 5 talk about different methods of collecting the ant specimens. If we look at paragraph no. 4, we can find the word ‘funnel’ in different lines. So, we can find all the answers in this paragraph. Question 37: some _________ Question 38: _________ Question 39: a _________ Question 40: some _________ Now, let’s have a close look at paragraph no. 4, “Many ants are small and forage primarily in the layer of leaves and other debris on the ground. Collecting these species by hand can be difficult. One of the most successful ways to collect them is to gather the leaf litter in which they are foraging and extract the ants from it. This is most commonly done by placing leaf litter on a screen over a large funnel, often under some heat. As the leaf litter dries from above, ants (and other animals) move downward and eventually fall out the bottom and are collected in alcohol placed below the funnel. This method works especially well in rain forests and marshy areas. A method of improving the catch when using a funnel is to sift the leaf litter through a coarse screen before placing it above the funnel. This will concentrate the litter and remove larger leaves and twigs. It will also allow more litter to be sampled when using a limited number of funnels.” Now, as the picture suggests, the answer to question no. 28 will be leaf litter (they look like leaf and garbage) and as the thing above the leaf litter indicates to question no. 27, the answer will be heat (the heat covers the leaf litter). “This is most commonly done by placing leaf litter on a screen over a large funnel, often under some heat.”(lines 4 and 5) Then, question no. 39 in the picture shows a covering above the funnel which holds the leaf litter. So, the answer for question no. 39 will be coarse screen. “A method of improving the catch when using a funnel is to sift the leaf litter through a coarse screen before placing it above the funnel.”(lines 7-9) Finally, for question no. 40, it looks like something below the funnel. So, the answer will be alcohol. “As the leaf litter dries from above, ants (and other animals) move downward and eventually fall out the bottom and are collected in alcohol placed below the funnel.” (lines 5-6) So, the answers are: heat leaf litter (coarse) screen alcohol",

Keywords for the question: Michael Faraday, first person, recognise, Perkin’s ability, student of chemistry, Take a look at paragraph no. 2 where the writer mentions, “His talent and devotion to the subject were perceived by his teacher (at the City of London school) Thomas Hall….”. This line suggests the fact that it was Thomas Hall, and not Michael Faraday, who first recognised the talent of Perkin in Chemistry. He also advised Perkin to attend the lectures given by Faraday. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 2: Michael Faraday suggested Perkin should enroll in the Royal College of Chemistry. Keywords for the question: Michael Faraday, should enroll, Royal College of Chemistry At the end of paragraph no. 2, we find the information that Perkin was able to enroll in the Royal College of Chemistry, but there is no mention of the person who suggested Perkin to admit in the college. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 3: Perkin employed August Wilhelm Hofmann as his assistant. Keywords for the question: employed, Hofmann, assistant, In paragraph no. 3, in lines 1-7, the writer mentions, ““At the time of Perkin’s enrolment, the Royal College of Chemistry was headed by the noted German chemist August Wilhelm Hofmann. Perkin’s scientific gifts soon caught Hofmann’s attention and, within two years, he became Hofmann’s youngest assistant.” This means Perkin did not employ Hofmann, rather Hofmann employed Perkin as his assistant. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 4: Perkin was still young when he made the discovery that made him rich and famous. Keywords for the question: still young, discovery, made him rich and famous, Take a look at the end of paragraph no. 3. The writer says here, “Perkin’s scientific gifts soon caught Hofmann’s attention and, within two years, he became Hofmann’s youngest assistant. Not long after that, Perkin made the scientific breakthrough that would bring him both fame and fortune.” Here, fame = famous, fortune = rich, scientific breakthrough = discovery, So, these lines suggest that Perkin was still young when he made the discovery. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 5: The trees from which quinine is derived grow only in South America. Keywords for the question: quinine, derived, grow, only in South America Paragraph no. 4 talks about the medicine quinine and its tree which is ‘cinchona tree’ which originates in South America. But, there is no information which suggest that this tree only grows in this part of the world only. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 6: Perkin hoped to manufacture a drug from a coal tar waste product. Keywords for the question: hoped, manufacture, drug, coal tar waste, In paragraph no. 5, in lines 4-7, the author says, “.. . .. He (Perkin) was attempting to manufacture quinine from aniline, an inexpensive and readily available coal tar waste product.” Here, attempted = hoped, quinine = a drug for the treatment of malaria. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 7: Perkin was inspired by the discoveries of the famous scientist Louis Pasteur. Keywords for the question: inspired by, Louis Pasteur At the end of paragraph no. 5 we find a quote of the world famous scientist Louis Pasteur. But there is no mention of any inspiration received by Perkin from the discoveries of Louis Pasteur. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Questions 8-13: Short answer to open questions (NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS) [In this kind of questions candidates have to answer some questions, only with some conditions like NO MORE THAN THREE/TWO WORDS and/or A NUMBER or, ONE WORD ONLY. Each question has keywords which will lead to the answer. This question type generally follows a sequence.] Question 8: Before Perkin’s discovery, with what group in society was the colour purple associated? Keywords for the question: before, Perkin’s discovery, what group, purple associated, In paragraph no. 6, the writer argues in lines 6-9, “Indeed, the purple colour extracted from a snail was once so costly that in society at the time, only the rich could afford it.” The lines suggest that before the discovery made by Perkin, the colour purple was associated with the rich. So, the answer is: the rich Question 9: What potential did Perkin immediately understand that his new dye had? Keywords for the question: potential, new dye, immediately understand, At the end of paragraph no. 7, the writer states, “ .. . . But perhaps the most fascinating of all Perkin’s reactions to his find was his nearly instant recognition that the new dye had commercial possibilities.” This means that Perkin immediately understood that his new dye had the potential of being sold commercially. So, the answer is: commercial (possibilities) Question 10: What was the name finally used to refer to the first colour Perkin invented? Keywords for the question: finally, name, first colour If we closely look at paragraph no. 7, we can find that the purple colour that Perkin discovered became the world’s first synthetic dye. Later, in the very beginning of paragraph no. 8, the writer mentions, “Perkin originally named his dye Tyrian Purple, but it later became commonly known as mauve.” So, the final name of the purple colour was mauve. So, the answer is: mauve Question 11: What was the name of the person Perkin consulted before setting up his own dye works? Keywords for the question: name, person, Perkin consulted, In paragraph no. 8, we can find the name of the person with whom Perkin consulted about setting up his own dye works. “He (Perkin) asked advice of Scottish dye works owner Robert Pullar, who assured him that manufacturing the dye would be well worth it if the colour remained fast and the cost was relatively low.” So, the answer is: Robert Pullar Question 12: In what country did Perkin’s newly invented colour first become fashionable? Keywords for the question: country, fashionable, Take a close look at paragraph no. 9 where the writer says, “The company received a commercial boost from the Empress Eugénie of France, when she decided the new colour flattered her. Very soon, mauve was the necessary shade for all the fashionable ladies in that country.” So, the answer is: France Question 13: According to the passage, which disease is now being targeted by researchers using synthetic dyes? Keywords for the question: disease, researchers, using synthetic dyes, Take a look at the end of paragraph no. 10. “And, in what would have been particularly pleasing to Perkin, their current use is in the research for a vaccine against malaria.” So, the answer is: malaria Reading Passage 2: Title of the passage: Is there anybody out there? Questions 14-17 (List of headings): [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph which will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence. ] Question 14: Paragraph B Here, in line no. 1 of Paragraph B, we find the mention of two ‘ground rules’ that SETI scientists adopt. In the first ground rule, we can see the writer mentions in line no. 4-5, “.. . .(although it is also important to keep an open mind in case any really convincing evidence emerges in the future.)”. This line suggest that there is no real evidence of extra-terrestrial intelligence so far, which indicates that these are only assumptions. Again, in line no. 5, the author mentions, “. . .Second, we make a very conservative assumption that . . ..” So, the answer is: iv (Assumptions underlying the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence) Question 15: Paragraph C In lines 4-6, the writer says, “. . . However, when we look at the 100 billion stars in our galaxy (the Milky Way), and 100 billion galaxies in the observable Universe, it seems inconceivable that at least one of these planets does not have a life form on it; in fact, the best educated guess we can make, . .. . . that perhaps one in 100,000 stars might have a life-bearing planet orbiting it.” Here, it seems inconceivable, best educated guess, perhaps, might have, all these phrases indicate to the word ‘likelihood’ or possibility. So, the answer is: vii (Likelihood of life on other planets) Question 16: Paragraph D Here, the first lines directly indicate to the fact that SETI scientists and organizations like NASA are seeking the transmission of radio signals from other planets. “An alien civilisation could choose many different ways of sending information across the galaxy, . .. .” Then, in the next lines we see discussion on radio signals, “. . . .. radio waves in the frequency range 1000 to 3000 MHz travel the greatest distance.” After that, in lines 11-12, we can learn about NASA getting a large fund from the government which is dedicated to locate or seek radio signals from other planets, “.. .Much of the money in this project is being spent on developing the special hardware needed to search many frequencies at once.” So, the answer is: i (Seeking the transmission of radio signals from planets) Question 17: Paragraph E The answer is in the first lines of paragraph E. “There is considerable debate over how we should react if we detect a signal from an alien civilisation. Everybody agrees that we should not reply immediately.” Here, Everybody agrees that we should not reply immediately means it is most appropriate that we should not response to the signals straight away. So, the answer is: ii (Appropriate responses to signals from other civilisations) Questions 18-20: Short answer to open questions (NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER) [In this kind of questions candidates have to answer some questions, only with some conditions like NO MORE THAN THREE/TWO WORDS and/or A NUMBER or, ONE WORD ONLY. Each question has keywords which will lead to the answer. This question type generally follows a sequence.] Question 18: What is the life expectancy of Earth?. Keywords for this question: likely to, live longer, zoo, than in the wild, The answer for this question lies in line no. 12, “…Since the lifetime of a planet like ours is several billion years, .. ..” Here, lifetime = life expectancy, a planet like ours = Earth, So, the answer is: several billion years Question 19: What kind of signals from other intelligent civilisations are SETI scientists searching for? Keywords for this question: some species, zoos, no longer be found, wild, From our reading of paragraph D for question no. 16, we came to know that SETI scientists are seeking radio signals from other planets. In this paragraph, line no. 5-6 says, “….and so all searches to date have concentrated on looking for radio waves in this frequency.” So, the answer is: radio (waves/signals) Question 20: How many stars are the world’s most powerful radio telescopes searching? Keywords for this question: improvements, quality of TV wildlife documentaries, insulted, increased, zoo visitors, In lines 13-15 of paragraph D the author says, “ . .. One part is a targeted search using the world’s largest radio telescopes, the American-operated telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico and the French telescope in Nancy in France. This part of the project is searching the nearest 1000 likely stars . . ..” Here, the world’s largest radio telescopes = the world’s most powerful radio telescopes So, the answer is: 1000 (stars) Questions 21-26 (YES, NO, NOT GIVEN) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN] [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 21: Alien civilisations may be able to help the human race to overcome serious problems. Keywords for this question: alien, help overcome problems, In the end of paragraph A, the author says in lines 16-18, “It it even possible that the older civilisation may pass on the benefits of their experience in dealing with threats to survival such as nuclear war and global pollution, and other threats that we haven’t yet discovered.” The lines suggest that alien civilisation may be able to assist us to deal with threats to survival. Here, may pass on the benefits of their experience = may be able to help So, the answer is: YES Question 22: SETI scientists are trying to find a life form that resembles humans in many ways. Keywords for this question: trying to find, life form, resemble humans In paragraph B, the author states in lines 5-6, “. .. .Second, we make a very conservative assumption that we are looking for a life form that is pretty well like us, since if it differs radically from us we may well not recognise it as a form….. .” Here, try to find = looking for, like = resembles, pretty well = in many ways, So, the answer is: YES Question 23: The Americans and Australians have co-operated on joint research projects. Keywords for this question: Americans and Australians, co-operated, joint research projects, We can find talks about ‘the Americans’ and ‘the Australians’ in paragraph D. However, there is no mention of any co-operation in research projects between the two. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 24: So far SETI scientists have picked up radio signals from several stars. Keywords for this question: picked up signals, several stars, In paragraph D, the writer states in lines 8-9, “Until now, there have not been any detections from the few hundred stars which have been searched.” The information in the passage contradicts with the question. So, the answer is: NO Question 25: The NASA project attracted criticism from some members of Congress. Keywords for this question: NASA projects, criticism, Congress, Again, we can see the mention of ‘members of Congress’ in paragraph D. But there is no mention of criticism by the members of Congress about the NASA project. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 26: If a signal from outer space is received, it will be important to respond promptly. Keywords for this question: signal, outer space, respond promptly, In line 2 of paragraph E, the author mentions, “Everybody agrees that we should not reply immediately.” The previous line talks about what to do in case of receiving a signal from the aliens. So, the lines suggest that we should not respond promptly or immediately if we receive a signal form the outer space. So, the answer is: NO Reading Passage 3: Title of the passage: The history of the tortoise Questions 27-30 (Short answer to open questions with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS) [In this kind of questions candidates have to answer some questions, only with some conditions like NO MORE THAN THREE/TWO WORDS and/or A NUMBER or, ONE WORD ONLY. Each question has keywords which will lead to the answer. This question type generally follows a sequence.] Question 27: What had to transfer from sea to land before any animals could migrate? Keywords for this question: transfer, from sea to land, before, animals, migrate The last lines of paragraph no. 1 give us the answer, “… And we mustn’t forget the plants, without whose prior invasion of the land none of the other migrations could have happened.” Here, transfer from sea to land before any animals = prior invasion of the land So, the answer is: plants Question 28: Which TWO processes are mentioned as those in which animals had to make big changes as they moved onto land? Keywords for this question: TWO processes, animals, had to make, big changes, moved onto land, The first lines of paragraph no. 2 indicate the answer for this question. “Moving from water to land involved a major redesign of every aspect of life, including breathing and reproduction.” Here, major redesign = big changes So, the answers are: breathing, reproduction (in any order) Question 29: Which physical feature, possessed by their ancestors, do whales, lack? Keywords for this question: physical feature, ancestors, whales, lack, In paragraph no. 2 we can find the mention of whales. Here, in lines 12-21, the author of the passage states, “Whales (including the small whales we call dolphins) and dugongs, with their close cousins the manatees, ceased to be land creatures altogether and reverted to the full marine habits of their remote ancestors. They don’t even come ashore to breed. They do, however, still breathe air, having never developed anything equivalent to the gills of their earlier marine incarnation.” Here, having never developed = lack, their earlier marine incarnation = their ancestors, So, the answer is: gills Question 30: Which animals might ichthyosaurs have resembled? Keywords for this question: ichthyosaurs, resembled, In paragraph no. 3 we can find the answer. In lines 13-17, the writer says, “Ichthyosaurs were reptilian contemporaries of the dinosaurs, with fins and streamlined bodies. The fossils look like dolphins and they surely lived like dolphins, in the water.” Here, look like = resemble So, the answer is: dolphins Questions 31-33: In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 31: Turtles were among the first group of animals to migrate back to the sea. Keywords for this question: turtles, first group, migrate, back to the sea, In paragraph no. 2 we find the writer saying, “Nevertheless, a good number of thoroughgoing land animals later turned around, abandoned their hard-earned terrestrial re-tooling, and returned to the water again.” This line doesn’t indicate whether turtles were the first group of animals to migrate back to the sea. IN this paragraph there is only the information about the turtles that they “went back to the sea a very long time age.. .” So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 32: It is always difficult to determine where an animal lived when its fossilised remains are incomplete. Keywords for this question: difficult, determine, where, lived, fossilised remains, incomplete, In paragraph no. 3, take a look at lines 9-13, “You might wonder how we can tell whether fossil animals lived on land or in water, especially if only fragments are found. Sometimes it’s obvious.” So, the lines mean that even though fossilised remains are in fragments (incomplete), it is not always difficult to (Sometimes it’s obvious) determine whether an animal lived in land or water. Here, the question statement contradicts with the information. Here, obvious = clear, apparent So, the answer is: FALSE Question 33: The habitat of ichthyosaurs can be determined by the appearance of their fossilised remains. Keywords for this question: habitat, ichthyosaurs, determined, appearance, fossilised remains, In paragraph no. 3, look at lines 13-17, “Ichthyosaurs were reptilian contemporaries of the dinosaurs, with fins and streamlined bodies. The fossils look like dolphins and they surely lived like dolphins, in the water.” Therefore, it is true that the habitat of ichthyosaurs can be determined by taking a close look at their fossils. So, the answer is: TRUE Questions 34-39: (Completing flow chart with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to write NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER to complete a flow chart on the given topic. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word.] Title: Method of determining where the ancestors of turtles and tortoises come from Step 1: Question 34: 71 species of living turtles and tortoises were examined and a total of ____________ were taken from the bones of their forelimbs. Keywords for this question: 71 species, living turtles and tortoises, examined, bones, forelimbs, In paragraph no. 4 we find the mention of ‘71 species of living turtles and tortoises’. So, we should read attentively to find our answer here. The writer says in the beginning of paragraph no. 4, “Walter Joyce Jacques Gauthier, at Yale University, obtained three measurements in these particular bones (of their forelimbs as mentioned at the end of paragraph no. 3) of 71 species of living turtles and tortoises.” So, the answer is: 3/three measurements Step 2: Question 35: The data was recorded on a _________(necessary for comparing the information). Keywords for this question: data, recorded on, necessary, comparing information, In lines 5-7 of paragraph no. 4 the writer says, “. . . They used a kind of triangular graph paper to plot the three measurements against one another.” Here, to plot … . . .. against one another = necessary for comparing the information So, the answer is: (triangular) graph Question 36: Outcome: Land tortoises were represented by a dense _________ of points towards the top. Sea turtles were grouped together in the bottom part. Keywords for this question: outcome, land tortoises, dense, points, towards the top, The answer can be found in lines 7-11, “. . . All the land tortoise species formed a tight cluster of points in the upper part of the triangle; all the water turtles cluster in the lower part of the triangular graph.” Here, tight = dense, lower part = bottom part, So, the answer is: cluster Step 3: Question 37: The same data was collected from some living _________ species and added to the other results. Keywords for this question: same data, collected, some living, species, added to, other results, In lines 11-14 of paragraph no. 4, the author says, “.. . .. . . There was no overlap, except when they added some species that spend time both in water and on land. Sure enough, these amphibious species show up . ..”. So, the data was added to the graph was from some amphibious species. So, the answer is: amphibious Question 38: Outcome: The points for these species turned out to be positioned about _________ up the triangle between the land tortoises and the sea turtles. Keywords for this question: outcome, points, species, turned out to be, positioned, triangle, between, land tortoises, sea turtles, The answer lies in lines 13-17, the author says, “. .. Sure enough, these amphibious species show up on the triangular graph approximately half way between the ‘wet cluster’ of sea turtles and the ‘dry cluster’ of land tortoises. Here, show up = positioned, approximately = about, So, the answer is: half way Step 4: Bones of P. quenstedti and P. talampayensis were examined in a similar way and the results added. Question 39: Outcome: The position of the points indicated that both these ancient creatures were ________. Keywords for this question: bones, P. quenstedti and P. talampayensis, examined, similar way, position, points, indicated, ancient creatures, We can see the mention of ‘the bones of P. quenstedti and P. talampayensis’ at the end of paragraph no. 4. Here, in lines 19-23, the author says, “. . .. The bones of P. quenstedti and P. talampayensis leave us no doubt. Their points on the graph are right in the thick of the dry cluster. Both these fossils were dry-land tortoises.” Here, fossils = ancient creatures, So, the answer is: dry-land tortoises Question 40: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers for previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] According to the writer, the most significant thing about tortoises is that – A. they are able to adapt to life in extremely dry environments. B. their original life form was a kind of primeval bacteria. C. they have so much in common with sea turtles. D. they have made the transition from sea to land more than once. As the question asks us to identify the most significant thing about tortoises, we need to look closely at the final paragraph, as this paragraph will give us the summary of the whole passage. Take a look at this paragraph where the author says, “Tortoises therefore represent a remarkable double return. In common with all mammals, reptiles and birds, their remote ancestors were marine fish and before that various more or less worm-like creatures stretching back, still in the sea, to the primeval bacteria. Later ancestors lived on land and stayed there for a very large number of generations. Later ancestors still evolved back into the water and become sea turtles. And finally they returned yet again to the land as tortoises, some of which now live in the driest of deserts.” This paragraph suggests to the fact that the tortoises have changed their habitat from sea to land a number of times. So, the answer is: D",

Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 1: an account of a national policy initiative Keywords for the question: national policy initiative IN the beginning of Section H, the writer mentions, “The New Zealand Government has developed a New Zealand Disability Strategy and has embarked on a wide-ranging consultation process.” Here, New Zealand Disability Strategy is the name of the policy and it is a national policy as it is developed by the New Zealand government. So, the answer is: H Question 2: a description of a global team effort Keywords for the question: global team effort In the last lines of Section C, the author mentions, “The International Institute of Noise Control Engineering (I-INCE), on the advice of the World Health Organization, has established an international working party, which includes New Zealand, to evaluate noise and reverberation control for school rooms.” Here, an international working party = global team effort So, the answer is: C Question 3: a hypothesis as to one reason behind the growth in classroom noise Keywords for the question: reason, growth, classroom noise, Section B starts with this line, “A preliminary study in New Zealand has shown that classroom noise presents a major concern for teachers and pupils… . .. . ” Then in lines 7-9 the writer says, “.. . . . This all amounts to heightened activity and noise levels, which have the potential to be particularly serious for children experiencing auditory function deficit.” Here, phrases such as A preliminary study and which have the potential to be indicates that the reason behind growth in classroom noise is a hypothesis because it is not confirmed. So, the answer is: B Question 4: a demand for suitable worldwide regulations Keywords for the question: suitable, worldwide regulations, The last line of Section I give us the answer. “It is imperative that the needs of these children are taken into account in the setting of appropriate international standards to be promulgated in future.” Here, It is imperative means that a demand has been made. Also, international standards = worldwide regulations, So, the answer is: I Question 5: a list of medical conditions which place some children more at risk from noise than others Keywords for the question: medical conditions, children, more at risk, from noise, than others, In Section D we can find the medical conditions which place some children at more risk from noise. Those conditions are, “… . . hearing impairment, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit disorders (ADD/ADHD). So, the answer is: D Question 6: the estimated proportion of children in New Zealand with auditory problems Keywords for the question: estimated proportion, children in New Zealand, auditory problems, The last lines of Section A points us to the answer. Here, the author says, “ . .. . . The New Zealand Ministry of Health has found from research carried out over two decades that 6-10% of children in that country are affected by hearing loss.” So, the answer is: A Questions 7-10: Short answer to open questions (NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS) [In this kind of questions candidates have to answer some questions, only with some conditions like NO MORE THAN THREE/TWO WORDS and/or A NUMBER or, ONE WORD ONLY. Each question has keywords which will lead to the answer. This question type generally follows a sequence.] Question 7: For what period of time has hearing loss in schoolchildren been studied in New Zealand? Keywords for the question: hearing loss, schoolchildren, studied in New Zealand, In Section A, in the last lines the writer says, “. .. . . The New Zealand Ministry of Health has found from research carried out over two decades that 6-10% of children in that country are affected by hearing loss.” The lines suggest that the study on hearing loss in schoolchildren has been done for two decades. So, the answer is: two decades Question 8: In addition to machinery noise, what other type of noise can upset children with autism? Keywords for the question: addition to machinery noise, upset, children with autism, The answer lies in Section E. Here, in lines 9-10, the writer states, “. . . Those experiencing these disorders often find sounds such as crowd noise and the noise generated by machinery painful and distressing.” Here, other than noise created by machines, the type of noise that can upset children is crowd noise. So, the answer is: crowd (noise) Question 9: What term is used to describe the hearing problems of schoolchildren which have not been diagnosed? Keywords for the question: hearing problems, schoolchildren, not been diagnosed, In the last lines of paragraph G, the author says, “It is probable that many undiagnosed children exist in the education system with ‘invisible’ disabilities.” Here, have not been diagnosed = undiagnosed So, the answer is: invisible (disabilities/disability) Question 10: What part of the New Zealand Disability Strategy aims to give schoolchildren equal opportunity? Keywords for the question: What part, New Zealand Disability Strategy, aims, schoolchildren, equal opportunity, In paragraph H, the writer says, “Objective 3 of the New Zealand Disability Strategy is to ‘Provide the Best Education for Disabled People’ by improving education so that all children, youth learners and adult learners will have equal opportunities to learn and develop within their already existing school.” So, the answer is: Objective 3 Questions 11 12: (Choosing the TWO best answers) [In this type of question, candidates are asked TWO best possible answers for one question. Candidates need to write the correct LETTERS for the answers. Here, the techniques for Multiple Choice Questions are applicable.] Question 11 12: The list below includes factors contributing to classroom noise. Which TWO are mentioned by the writer of the passage? A. Current teaching methods B. Echoing corridors C. Cooling systems D. Large class sizes E. Loud-voiced teachers F. Playground games Keywords for the question: factors, contributing, classroom noise, In paragraph B, the writer states in lines 2-5, “Modern teaching practices, the organisation of desks in the classroom, poor classroom acoustics, and mechanical means of ventilation such as air- conditioning units all contribute to the number of children unable to comprehend the teacher’s voice.” Here, Modern teaching practices = current teaching methods, mechanical means of ventilation such as air-conditioning units = cooling systems, So, the answers are: (in either order) A C Question 13: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers for previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] What is the writer’s overall purpose in writing this article? A. To compare different methods of dealing with auditory problems B. To provide solutions for overly noisy learning environments C. To increase awareness of the situation of children with auditory problems D. To promote New Zealand as a model for other countries to follow Keywords for the question: overall purpose, If you take a close look at the beginning of the passage, you will find the writer alerting us by stating that “Hearing impairment or other auditory function deficit in young children can have a major impact on their development of speech and communication, resulting in a detrimental effect on their ability to learn at school. This is likely to have major consequences for the individual and the population as a whole.” Then, in the following sections, the author gives a detailed description of the situation of hearing deficit in schoolchildren in New Zealand by discussing the causes, effects and ways out to this problem. So, overall, the writer’s purpose or aim is obviously to ‘increase awareness of the situation of children with auditory problems”. So, the answer is: C Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Venus in transit Questions 14-17 (Identifying information): [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 14: examples of different ways in which the parallax principle has been applied Keywords for the question: different ways, parallax principle, applied, The first lines of paragraph F indicates that the parallax principle has been applied in several ways using different measurements. “But astronomers labored hard to analyse the results of these expeditions to observe Venus transits. Johann Franz Encke, Director of the Berlin Observatory, finally determined a value for the AU based on all these parallax measurements.” Here, determined a value . . .. . all these parallax measurements = different ways …. Parallax principle ….applied, So, the answer is: F Question 15: a description of an event which prevented a transit observation Keywords for the question: event, prevented, transit observation, Take a look at the very last line of paragraph D, “Ironically, after travelling nearly 50,000 kilometres, his view was clouded out at the last moment, a very dispiriting experience.” Here, his view was clouded out at the last moment = the event which prevented the observation, So, the answer is: D Question 16: a statement about potential future discoveries leading on from transit observations Keywords for the question: potential future discoveries, transit observations, TIPS: It is generally observed in IELTS exam that any statement indicating “future” is mostly found in the last paragraphs. So, when you are asked to look for ‘future’, go straight to the last paragraph. In paragraph G, the last lines give us the answer, “. . . But such transits have paved the way for what might prove to be one of the most vital breakthroughs in the cosmos – detecting Earth-sized planets orbiting other stars.” Here, paved the way for = leading on from, might prove to be = future, breakthroughs = discoveries, So, the answer is: G Question 17: a description of physical states connected with Venus which early astronomical instruments failed to overcome Keywords for the question: physical states, connected, Venus, early astronomical instruments, failed, The last lines of paragraph E indicate the answer for us. “.. .. . . this showed astronomers that Venus was surrounded by a thick layer of gases refracting sunlight around it, both effects made it impossible to obtain accurate timings.” Here, made it impossible to obtain = failed to overcome So, the answer is: E Questions 18-21: (Matching statements with correct person or people): (The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the keywords and read around different names of people or person carefully. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same person in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions may not follow any sequential order. ) Question 18: He calculated the distance of the Sun from the Earth based on observations of Venus with a fair degree of accuracy. Keywords for this question: distance, observations of Venus, accuracy, In paragraph F, the writer says in lines 2-5, “. … . . Johann Franz Encke, Director of the Berlin Observatory, finally determined a value for the AU based on all these parallax measurements: 153,340,000 km. Reasonably accurate for the time, that is quite close to today’s value of 149,597,870 km. . .. ..” Here, a fair degree of accuracy = Reasonably accurate, AU (Astronomical Unit) = distance of the Earth from the Sun (in paragraph B) So, the answer is: D (Johann Franz Encke) Question 19: He understood that the distance of the Sun from the Earth could be worked out by comparing observations of a transit. Keywords for this question: distance, worked out by comparing observations, In paragraph B we find how Edmund Halley realised the observation of a transit could help find out the distance between the Earth and the Sun, “He realised that from different latitudes, the passage of the planet across the Sun’s disc would appear to differ. By timing the transit from two widely-separated locations, teams of astronomers could calculate the parallax angle – the apparent difference in position of an astronomical body due to a difference in the observer’s position. Calculating this angle would allow astronomers to measure what was then the ultimate goal: the distance of the Earth from the Sun.” So, the answer is: A (Edmund Halley) Question 20: He realised that the time taken by a planet to go around the Sun depends on its distance from the Sun. Keywords for this question: time, around the Sun, distance from the Sun, Paragraph C talks about Johannes Kepler’s realisation about timing of the orbit done by a planet around the Sun. Here, the writer says, “Johannes Kepler, in the early 17th century, had shown that the distances of the planets from the Sun governed their orbital speeds, which were easily measurable.” Here, go around means orbit (orbital) So, the answer is: B (Johannes Kepler) Question 21: He witnessed a Venus transit but was unable to make any calculations. Keywords for this question: Venus transit, unable, make calculations, In lines 4-6 of paragraph D, the writer sympathizes Guillaume Le Gentil which indicates that he was unable to do something, “. . .. . The person who deserves most sympathy is the French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil.” Then follow the last lines, “ .. . Ironically, after travelling nearly 50,000 kilometres, his view was clouded out at the last moment, a very dispiriting experience.” So, the answer is: C (Guillaume Le Gentil) Questions 22-26 (TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN) In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 22: Halley observed one transit of the planet Venus. Keywords for this question: Halley, observed, transit, Venus, In the last few lines of paragraph C, the writer says, “. . .and Halley worked out that by using Venus it would be possible to measure the Sun’s distance to 1 part in 500. But there was a problem: transits of Venus, unlike those of Mercury, are rare, occurring in pairs roughly eight years apart every hundred or so years. Nevertheless, he accurately predicted that Venus would cross the face of the Sun in both 1761 and 1769 – though he didn’t survive to see either.” These lines suggest that Halley predicted the transits of Venus but he was not able to observe any transit because he died before that. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 23: Le Gentil managed to observe a second Venus transit. Keywords for this question: Le Gentil, observe, second Venus transit, In paragraph D, the writer states in lines 8-11, “Undaunted, he remained south of the equator ….before setting off to observe the next transit in the Philippines. Ironically, after traveling nearly 50,000 kilometers, his view was clouded out at the last moment, a very dispiriting experience.” Here, his view was clouded out = he could not observe the transit, The lines suggest that Le Gentil was not able to observe a second Venus transit in the Philippines due to the thickness of the cloud. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 24: The shape of Venus appears distorted when it starts to pass in front of the Sun. Keywords for this question: shape, distorted, pass in front of the sun, In paragraph E, take a look at lines 1-3, “While the early transit timings were as precise as instruments would allow, the measurements were dogged by the ‘black drop’ effect. When Venus begins to cross the Sun’s disc, it looks smeared not circular.” Here, pass in front of the Sun = cross the Sun’s disc, distorted = smeared not circular So, the answer is: TRUE Question 25: Early astronomers suspected that the atmosphere on Venus was toxic. Keywords for this question: early astronomers, suspected, atmosphere on Venus, toxic, There is no information in this passage about the atmosphere of Venus. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 26: The parallax principle allows astronomers to work out how far away distant stars are from the Earth. Keywords for this question: parallax principle, how far, stars, Earth, In paragraph F, take a look at lines 7-10, “The parallax principle can be extended to measure the distances to the stars. If we look at a star in January – when Earth is at one point in its orbit – it will seem to be in a different position from where it appears six month later. Knowing the width of Earth’s orbit, the parallax shift lets astronomers calculate the distance.” The lines suggest that the parallax principles can be used to measure the distance between different stars and the Earth. So, the answer is: TRUE Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: A neuroscientist reveals how to think differently Questions 27-31 (Multiple choice questions) [‘Multiple choice questions’ is a common type of question set in IELTS Reading test. It is also found in Listening test. Most of the time, they come with four options but sometimes there are three options. Candidates need to work hard for this type of questions because this may confuse them easily in passage 2 or passage 3. There will be long answers for each question, so they may kill valuable time. So, quick reading or skimming technique might come handy here. Remember that answers in 3 options out of 4 will be very close. So, vocabulary power will help a lot to choose the best answer. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question 27: Neuroeconomics is a field of study which seeks to – Keywords for this question: Neuroeconomics, seeks to, In the first paragraph, the writer says in lines 3-5, “These discoveries have led to the field known as neuroeconomics which studies the brain’s secrets to success in an economic environment that demands innovation and being able to do things differently from competitors.” The lines suggest that neuroeconomics is the field of study that looks for understanding the link between brain and creativity that leads to achievement in different competitions. Here, success = achievements So, the answer is: C (understand how brain is linked to achievement in competitive fields) Question 28: According to the writer, iconoclasts are distinctive because – Keywords for this question: iconoclasts, distinctive, because, Take a look at lines 1-3 of paragraph no. 2, “This definition implies that iconoclasts are different from other people, but more precisely, it is their brains that are different in three distinct ways: perception, fear response, and social intelligence.” The lines indicate that iconoclasts are different from other people (distinctive) because their brains works differently. So, the answer is: B (their brains function differently) Question 29: According to the writer, the brain works efficiently because – Keywords for this question: brain, works efficiently, because, In paragraph 3, the author states in lines 3-6, “For example, when confronted with information streaming from the eyes, the brain will interpret this information in the quickest way possible. Thus it will draw on both past experience and any other source of information… . ” So, according to the passage, the brain functions quickly because it depends on events of the past. Here, quickly = in the quickest way, depends on = draw on, events of the past = past experience, So, the answer is: D (it relies on previous events) Question 30: The writer says that perception is – Keywords for this question: perception, Take a close look at the end of paragraph no. 3, the author states in the last lines, “More than the physical reality of photons and sound waves, perception is a product of the brain.” The lines indicate that perception is the outcome/product of the brain. So, the answer is: C (a result of brain processes) Question 31: According to the writer, an iconoclastic thinker – Keywords for this question: iconoclastic thinker, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 4. Here, the writer says in lines, “Iconoclasts, either because they were born that way or through learning, have found ways to work around the perceptual shortcuts that plague most people.” Here, work around = avoid, perpetual shortcuts that plague = cognitive traps, So, the answer is: B (avoids cognitive traps) Questions 32-37: (YES, NO, NOT GIVEN) In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the claims of the writer – YES The statement in the question contradicts the claims of the writer – NO If it is impossible to say what the writer thinks about this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 32: Exposure to different events forces the brain to think differently. Keywords for this question: exposure, different events, forces, think differently, The answer for this question is in paragraph no. 5. In the beginning of the paragraph the writer says, “The best way to see things differently to other people is to bombard the brain with things it has never encountered before. Novelty releases the perceptual process from the chains of past experience and forces the brain to make new judgments.” Here, think differently = make new judgments, exposure to different event = to bombard the brain with things it has never encountered before. So, the answer is: YES Question 33: Iconoclasts are unusually receptive to new experiences. Keywords for this question: iconoclasts, usually, receptive, new experiences, In paragraph no. 5, take a look at lines 3-4, where the author says, “Successful iconoclasts have an extraordinary willingness to be exposed to what is fresh and different.” Here, have an extraordinary willingness to be exposed = unusually receptive, fresh and different = new experiences, So, the answer is: YES Question 34: Most people are too shy to try different things. Keywords for this question: most people, too shy, try, different things, From this passage we just learn that people avoid such things or activities which they try to avoid. However, the writer does not mention whether most of the people are shy too try different things or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 35: If you think in an iconoclastic way, you can easily overcome fear. Keywords for this question: exposure, different events, forces, think differently, In paragraph no. 6, in lines 2-3, the writer states, “Fear is a major impediment to thinking like an iconoclast and stops the average person in his tracks.” This means fear works as a blockade against thinking like an iconoclast. So, if someone thinks like an iconoclast, he/she cannot overcome fear. So, the statement is contradictory. So, the answer is: NO Question 36: When concern about embarrassment matters less, other fears become irrelevant. Keywords for this question: iconoclasts, usually, receptive, new experiences, There is no information in relation with embarrassment being more or less. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 37: Fear of public speaking is a psychological illness. Keywords for this question: most people, too shy, try, different things, We find the mention of public speaking in paragraph no. 6. Here, in lines 5-7, “But fear of public speaking, which everyone must do from time to time, afflicts one-third of the population. This makes it too common to be considered a mental disorder. It is simply a common variant of human nature, one which iconoclasts do not let inhibit their reactions.” Here, too common to be considered a mental disorder = so common that it cannot be considered a psychological illness, So, the statement in the passage contradicts with the question. So, the answer is: NO Questions 38-40: (Completing sentences with correct ending) [For this type of question, candidates need to match the beginning and ending of sentences. Candidates need to look for keywords in the sentence-beginnings and find the relative paragraphs and then sentences in the passage. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question 38: Thinking like a successful iconoclast is demanding because it – Keywords for this question: thinking like, successful iconoclast, demanding, because, In lines 1-2 of paragraph no. 7, the author says, “. .. . to be successful iconoclasts, individuals must sell their ideas to other people. This is where social intelligence come in.” Here, we can understand that successful iconoclasts need social intelligence. Then, in lines 7-8, we find the reference of perceptual skills, “Perception is important in social cognition too…”. Finally, in the last lines, the writer talks about the demand of thinking like a successful iconoclast, “Understanding how perception becomes intertwined with social decision making shows why successful iconoclasts are so rare.” Here, rare = demanding So, the answer is: A (requires both perceptual and social intelligence skills) Question 39: The concept of the social brain is useful to iconoclasts because it – Keywords for this question: concept, social brain, useful, iconoclasts, because, In paragraph no. 7, take a look at lines 3-7, “In the last decade there has been an explosion of knowledge about the social brain and how the brain works when groups coordinate decision making. Neuroscience has revealed which brain circuits are responsible for functions like understanding what other people think, empathy, fairness, and social identity. These brain regions play key roles in whether people convince others of their ideas.” So, the lines suggest that the concept of ‘social brain’ plays key roles (is useful) to iconoclasts as these brain regions focuses on group-decision making. Here, groups decide on an action = groups coordinate decision making So, the answer is: B (focuses on how groups decide on an action) Question 40: Iconoclasts are generally an asset because their way of thinking – Keywords for this question: iconoclasts, generally, asset, because, way of thinking, The last paragraph gives us the answer. In lines 1-4, the author says, “Iconoclasts create new opportunities in every area from artistic expression to technology to business. They supply creativity and innovation not easily accomplished by committees. Iconoclasts face alienation and failure, but can also be an asset to any organisation.” The lines indicate that iconoclasts are an asset because their process of thinking works in artistic and scientific fields. So, the answer is: C (works in many fields, both artistic and scientific)",

Keywords for the question: understandable reasons, arguments occur, language, Let’s have a look at the first paragraph. In lines 2-4 the writer says, “Language belongs to everyone, so most people feel they have a right to hold an opinion about it. And when opinions differ, emotions can run high. Arguments can start . . .. . . .”. The lines suggest that there are logics in favour of arguments about language. So, the answer is: YES Question 2: People feel more strongly about language education than about small difference in language usage. Keywords for the question: more strongly, language education, small difference, language usage, The last lines of paragraph no. 1 give us the answer. Here, the writer says, “Arguments can start as easily over minor points of usage as over major policies of linguistic education.” The lines suggest that people feel as strong about minor points (small differences) as they feel about linguistic education (language education). The feelings are equal for both. So, the answer is: NO Question 3: Our assessment of a person’s intelligence is affected by the way he or she uses language. Keywords for the question: assessment, person’s intelligence, affected, uses language, In lines 2-4 of paragraph no. 2, the writer says, “.. .. . . linguistic factors influence how we judge personality, intelligence, social status, educational standards, job aptitude, and many other areas of identity and social survival.” Here, our assessment of a person’s intelligence = how we judge intelligence, affect = influence, So, the answer is: YES Question 4: Prescriptive grammar books cost a lot of money to buy in the 18th century. Keywords for the question: prescriptive grammar books, cost a lot, 18th century, We find the mention of 18th century in paragraph no. 4 and 5. However, we do not find the mention of grammar books being costly in 18th century. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 5: Prescriptivism still exists today. Keywords for the question: prescriptivism, exists, today, The answer can be found by studying two paragraphs. First, in paragraph no. 4, the writer talks about what is prescriptivism. “All the main languages have been studied prescriptively, especially in the 18 century approach to the writing of grammars and dictionaries…. . .. . Some usages are “prescribed”, to be learnt and followed accurately;. …. . .” Then in the beginning of paragraph no. 5, the author says, ““These attitudes are still with us…”. So, the writer says that prescriptivism still exists. So, the answer is: YES Question 6: According to descriptivists, it is pointless to try to stop language change. Keywords for the question: pointless, stop language change, Take a look at lines 4-6 of paragraph no. 5, “… .. . it is the task of the grammarian to describe, not prescribe – to record the facts of linguistic diversity, and not to attempt the impossible tasks of evaluating language variation or halting language change.” Here, attempt the impossible task means it is pointless to try, halting means stop. So, the answer is: YES Question 7: Descriptivism only appeared after the 18th century. Keywords for the question: Descriptivism, after, 18th century, In paragraph 5, the writer states, “This approach is summarised in the statement that it is the task of the grammarian to describe, not prescribe – to record the facts of linguistic diversity, and not to attempt the impossible tasks of evaluating language variation or halting language change. In the second half of the 18th century, we already find advocates of this view, such as Joseph Priestley, whose Rudiments of English Grammar (1761) insists that “the custom of speaking is the original and only just standard of any language”.” So, these lines suggest that descriptivism appeared first in the 18th century. So, the answer is: NO Question 8: Both descriptivists and prescriptivists have been misrepresented. Keywords for the question: descriptivists, prescriptivists, misrepresented, Take a look at the last paragraph where the author says, “In our own time, the opposition between descriptivists and prescriptivists has often become extreme, with both sides painting unreal pictures of the other.” Here, misrepresented = painting unreal pictures of the other, So, the statement is true. So, the answer is: YES Questions 9-12: (Summary completion with list of words given in the box) (In this kind of questions candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. As these are fill in the blanks or gaps, there is a condition of writing letters which represent the words listed in a box. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps.) The title of the summary: The language debate According to 9. …………………….. there is only one correct form of language. Linguists who take this approach to language place great importance on grammatical 10. ……………………. .Conversely, the view of 11. ……………….…., such as Joseph Priestly, is that grammar should be based on 12. …………………….…. . List of words: A. descriptivists, B. language experts, C. popular speech, D. formal language, E. evaluation, F. rules, G. modern linguists, H. prescriptivists, I. change, Question 9: According to __________, there is only one correct form of language. Keywords for the question: only one, correct form, language, In the beginning of paragraph no. 3, the author mentions the view of prescriptivists, “. .. . . prescriptivism is the view that one variety of language has an inherently higher value than others, and that this ought to be imposed on the whole of the speech community.” The lines suggest that people who believe in prescriptivism form the view that only one language is valued over all other languages and it has to be believed by everybody. So, the answer is: H (prescriptivists) Question 10: Linguists who take this approach to language place great importance on grammatical ___________. Keywords for the question: place, great importance, grammatical, Take a look closely at paragraph no. 4. Here, the writer says, “… . .. All the main languages have been studied prescriptively, especially in the 18th century approach to the writings of grammars and dictionaries….. . . . .. .The authoritarian nature of the approach is best characterised by its reliance on ‘rules’ of grammar.” Here, this approach means the approach of the prescriptivists, place great importance means reliance on, So, the answer is: F (rules) Question 11 12: Conversely, the view of 11. ____________, such as Joseph Priestley, is that grammar should be based on 12. _____________. Keywords for the question: view, Joseph Priestly, grammar should be, based on, We can see the mention of the view of Joseph Priestly in paragraph no. 5. So, let’s take a look at this paragraph. In paragraph no. 5, the writer says, “Nevertheless, there is an alternative point of view that is concerned less with standards than the facts of linguistic usage. This approach is summarised in the statement that it is the task of the grammarian to describe, not prescribe – to record the facts of linguistic diversity, and not to attempt the impossible tasks of evaluating language variation or halting language change. In the second half of the 18th century, we already find advocates of this view, such as Joseph Priestley, whose Rudiments of English Grammar (1761) insists that ‘the custom of speaking is the original and only just standard of any language’.” Here, nevertheless = conversely, to describe, not prescribe, = the view of descriptivists, original and just standard = should be based on, The custom of speaking means the way people should speak or most popular way of speaking / popular speech, So, the answers are: A (descriptivists) C (popular speech) Question 13: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers for previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] What is the writer’s purpose in Reading passage 1? a. to argue in favour of a particular approach to writing dictionaries and grammar books. b. to present a historical account of differing views of language. c. to describe the differences between spoken and written language. d. to show how a certain view of language has been discredited Keywords for the question: writer’s purpose, The passage details about different views and approaches towards language and how they occurred and changed over the course of time. Firstly, we find the view of prescriptivists and then the other view of descriptivism. Take a look at the last paragraph also. The last paragraph can be considered as the summary of what has been told in the previous paragraphs. Here, the writer says that we can see in present time the conflicting views between prescriptivists and descriptivists which have been a conflict between radical liberalism and elitist conservatism. So, we can understand that the writer’s purpose in this passage is to present a historical account of differing views of language. So, the answer is: B (to present a historical account of differing views of language.) Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Tidal Power Questions 14-17 (Identifying information): [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 14: the location of the first test site Keywords for the question: location, first test site, The location of the first site is given in paragraph C where writer states, “The first station is expected to be installed off Lynmouth in Devon shortly to test the technology in a venture jointly funded by the department of Trade and Industry and the European Union.” So, the answer is: C Question 15: the way of bringing the power produced on one site back into Britain Keywords for the question: bringing, power produced, site, back into Britain, In paragraph E, the author mentions, “Dr Bahaj has done most work on the Alderney site, where there are powerful currents. The single undersea turbine farm would produce far more power than needed for the Channel Islands and most would be fed into the French Grid and be re-imported into Britain via the cable under the Channel.” Here, re-imported into Britain = back into Britain, So, the answer is: E Question 16: a reference to a previous attempt by Britain to find an alternative source of energy Keywords for the question: previous attempt, by Britain, find an alternative source, In paragraph A, the writer says, “Unlike wind power, which Britain originally developed and then abandoned for 20 years allowing the Dutch to make it a major industry, undersea turbines could become a big export earner to island nations such as Japan and New Zealand”. The lines indicate to the fact that the British made a previous attempt to use wind power as a sustainable and alternative source of energy, though they were not successful and they abandoned this attempt for 20 years. So, the answer is: A Question 17: mention of the possibility of applying technology from another industry Keywords for the question: possibility, applying technology, another industry, In paragraph C, we can see the mention of possible use of a technology, “The technology for dealing with the hostile saline environment under the sea has been developed in the North Sea oil industry and much is already known about .. . ….” So, another industry which has used the technology is the North Sea oil industry. So, the answer is: C Questions 18-22: (Choosing options (claims) from given statements) [In these questions candidates have to choose some options from the given statements. These questions will not follow any sequential orders so candidates need to apply their skills of skimming by reading the statements and finding the correct keywords. ] Which FIVE of the following claims about tidal power are made by the writer? In paragraph A, the writer talks about tidal power and says, “…. . . . . unlike wind, the tides are predictable and the power input is constant (A). This technology raises the prospect of Britain becoming self-sufficient in renewable energy and drastically reducing its carbon dioxide emissions (D). If tides, wind and wave power are all developed, Britain would be able to close gas, coal and nuclear power plants (E) and export renewable power to other parts of Europe (F).” Again, in the end of paragraph C, the writer indicates that “The best sites are between islands or around heavily indented coasts where there are strong tidal currents. (J) ” Here, reliable = predictable, cut down = reduce, plants = stations, a means of increasing national income = export earner, So, the tides are predictable and the power input is constant = It is a more reliable source of energy than wind power (option A), drastically reducing its carbon dioxide emissions = It would cut down air pollution (option D), Britain would be able to close gas, coal and nuclear power plants = It would contribute to the closure of many existing power stations in Britain (option E), export renewable power to other parts of Europe = It could be a means of increasing national income (option F), The best sites are between islands or around heavily indented coasts where there are strong tidal currents = It is best produced in the vicinity of coastlines with particular features (option J). So the answers are: (in any order) A, D, E, F, J, Questions 23-26 (Labeling a diagram) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to label a diagram with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS from the passage. Keywords are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. However, we should not be surprised if the sequence is not maintained. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] An Undersea Turbine Question 23: Whole tower can be raised for __________ and the extraction of seaweed from the blades Keywords for this question: can be raised, extraction of seaweed, Here, our main keyword is ‘extraction of seaweed’. We can find the mention of seaweed at the end of Section D. The writer says, “The towers will stick out of the water and be lit, to warn shipping, and also be designed to be lifted out of the water for maintenance and to clean seaweed from the blades.” Here, lifted out = raised, clean seaweed = the extraction of seaweed, So, the answer is: maintenance Question 24: Sea life not in danger due to fact that blades are comparatively ____________ . Keywords for this question: sea life, not in danger, blades are comparatively, Here, our main keywords are sea life and not in danger which can be found in Section D, in the middle of the paragraph. “. . .. Fish and other creatures are thought unlikely to be at risk from the relatively slow-turning blades.” Here, Fish and other creatures = sea life, unlikely to be at risk = not in danger, relatively = comparatively, So, the answer is: slow / slow-turning Question 25 26: Air bubbles result from the _________ behind blades. This is known as __________. Keywords for this question: air bubbles, result from, behind blades, known as, Here, in these questions, the main keywords are air bubbles and result from which can be found in Section F. Let’s have a look there, “One technical difficulty is cavitation, where low pressure behind a turning blade causes air bubbles.” Here, causes = result from, So, the answers are: low pressure cavitation Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: Information theory – the big idea Questions 27-32 (Identifying information): [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 27: an explanation of the factors affecting the transmission of information. Keywords for this question: factors affecting, transmission of information, Paragraph D has the answer for this question. In lines 1-5 the writer says, “Noise usually means unwanted sounds which interfere with genuine information. Information theory generalises this idea via theorems that capture the effects of noise with mathematical precision. In particular, Shannon showed that noise sets a limit on the rate at which information can pass along communication channels while remaining error-free… .. .” Here, transmission = pass along communication channels So, the lines suggest that factors such as noise can affect transmission of information. So, the answer is: D Question 28: an example of how unnecessary information can be omitted Keywords for this question: unnecessary information, omitted, This question’s answer is found in paragraph F where the author talks about the solution of excluding unwanted information. In lines 1-4 the author states, “Shannon also laid the foundations of more efficient ways of storing information, by stripping out superfluous (redundant) bits from data which contributed little real information. As mobile phone text messages like ‘I CN C U’ show, it is often possible to leave out a lot of data without losing much meaning.” Here, stripping out superfluous (redundant) bits from data to leave out a lot of data means unnecessary data or information can be omitted. So, the answer is: F Question 29: a reference to Shannon’s attitude to fame Keywords for this question: Shannon’s attitude, fame, The answer lies in paragraph B where we find this line in the middle, “While at Bell Laboratories, Shannon developed information theory, but shunned the resulting acclaim.” Here, shunned means turned away from. It means Shannon developed information theory but he avoided the fame he got from his invention. He disliked it. So, the answer is: B Question 30: details of a machine capable of interpreting incomplete information Keywords for this question: machine, capable, interpreting, incomplete information, Take a close look at paragraph E. Here, the writer says in lines 5-7, “Other codes have become part of everyday life – such as the Universal Product Code, or bar code, which uses a simple error-detecting system that ensures supermarket check-out lasers can read the price even on, say, a crumpled bag of crisps.” Here, machine indicates to check-out lasers that can interpret (read) incomplete information (crumpled bag of crisps). So, the answer is: E Question 31: a detailed account of an incident involving information theory Keywords for this question: detailed account, incident, information theory, The answer can be found in paragraph A where we come to know about the problem faced by Voyager I which received instructions through a radio signal from the earth to use its spare parts to operate correctly. The whole paragraph is a detailed description of how NASA was able to send radio signals light years away to the Voyager I prove. So, the answer is: A Question 32: a reference to what Shannon initially intended to achieve in his research Keywords for this question: Shannon, initially, intended to achieve, his research, In paragraph C, the writer indicates, “He (Shannon) set out with an apparently simple aim: to pin down the precise meaning of the concept of ‘information’.” Here, set out with an apparently simple aim = initially intended to achieve So, the answer is: C Questions 33-37: (Note completion) Title of the note: The Voyager I Space Probe Question 33-34: The probe transmitted pictures of both 33. _________ and _________, then left the 34. _________. Keywords for this question: transmitted pictures, both, left, As the word before question 33 is ‘both’, we can understand that the answers for question no. 33 will be same kind of things. If we look closely at paragraph A, we can find the description of Voyager I Space Probe’s mention. In lines 2-4, the writer says, “The space probe, Voyager I, launched in 1977, had sent back spectacular images of Jupiter and Saturn and then soared out of the Solar System on a one-way mission to the stars.” Here, sent back = transmitted, images = pictures, soared out = left, So, the answers are: Jupiter, Saturn Solar System Question 35: Scientists feared that both the ________ and ________ were about to stop working. Keywords for this question: Scientists, feared, both, about to stop working, In paragraph A take a look at lines 5-7, “Sensors and circuits were on the brink of failing and NASA experts realised that they had to do something or lose contact with their probe forever.” Here, on the brink of failing = about to stop working, So, the answers are: sensors, circuits, Special Note: remember, you cannot write sensors and circuits as your answers. It is because the word ‘and’ is already present in the question. In the IELTS listening and Reading Test, it is PROHIBITED to write any word/words which is/are already written in the question. Question 36: The only hope was to tell the probe to replace them with __________ -but distance made communication with the probe difficult. Keywords for this question: only hope, replace, distance, made communication, probe, difficult, In paragraph A the writer talks about the solution of Voyager I problem. In lines 7-8 the author writes, “The solution was to get a message to Voyager I to instruct it to use spares to change the failing parts.” Here, solution = the only hope, change = replace, So, the answer is: spares Question 37: A ________ was used to transmit the message at the speed of light. Keywords for this question: transmit, message, speed of light Take a look at the end of paragraph A. Here, the author says in lines 9-12, “By means of a radio dish belonging to NASA’s Deep Space Network, the message was sent out into the depths of space. Even traveling at the speed of light, it took over 11 hours to reach its target, far beyond the speed of Pluto.” Here, the message was sent out = transmit the message, So, a radio dish was used to send out message to Voyager I. So, the answer is: radio dish Questions 38-40: (TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN) In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 38: The concept of describing something as true or false was the starting point for Shannon in his attempt to send messages over distance. Keywords for this question: describing, starting point, true or false, the starting point, Shannon, In paragraph C, the writer states in lines 3-6, “He set out with an apparently simple aim: to pin down the precise meaning of the concept of ‘information’. The most basic form of information, Shannon argued, is whether something is true or false – which can be captured in the binary unit, or ‘bit’, of the form 1 or 0.” Here, set out = the starting point, The lines clearly agree with the statement. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 39: The amount of information that can be sent in a given time period is determined with reference to the signal strength and noise level. Keywords for this question: the amount of information, sent, the signal strength and noise level, The answer is in paragraph D as Shannon showed that the rate told us how much information passed in a given period of time. “Shannon showed that noise sets a limit on the rate at which information can pass along communication channels while remaining error-free. This rate depends on the relative strengths of the signal and noise traveling down the communication channel, on its capacity (its ‘bandwidth’).” So, the answer is: TRUE Question 40: Products have now been developed which can convey more information than Shannon had anticipated as possible. Keywords for this question: convey more information, Shannon anticipated Take a close look at the end of paragraph E, the writer says, “As recently as 1993, engineers made a major breakthrough by discovering so-called turbo codes – which come very close to Shannon’s ultimate limit for the maximum rate that data can be transmitted reliably, and now play a key role in the mobile videophone revolution.” This means the products of present time came close to what Shannon had anticipated, but could not convey more information. They could not exceed Shannon’s expectations. So, the answer is: FALSE",

Keywords for the question: husband, joint winner, both Nobel Prizes, Let’s have a look at the first paragraph. In lines 5-8 the writer says, “With her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel, she (Marie) was awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics, and was then sole winner of the 1911 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.” The lines suggest that Marie Curie shared her first Nobel Prize with her husband and Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel in 1903, but she won the 1911 Nobel Prize for Chemistry alone (sole winner). So, the answer is: FALSE Buy Cambridge IELTS Series 9 from this link. Question 2: Marie became interested in science when she was a child. Keywords for the question: interested, science, child, In paragraph no. 2 we find information about Marie Curie’s childhood. We can learn about the brilliance of her memory. But there is no information about her interest in science. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 3: Marie was able to attend the Sorbonne because of her sister’s financial contribution. Keywords for the question: attend the Sorbonne, sister’s financial contribution, In the end of paragraph no. 2, the writer says, “.. .. . . From her earnings she was able to finance her sister Bronia’s medical studies in Paris, on the understanding that Bronia would, in turn, later help her to get an education.” This means Marie financed her sister Bronia’s education and hoped that one day Bronia would be able to help in Marie’s education. Then, in the next paragraph, the writer says, “In 1891, this promise was fulfilled and Marie went to Paris and began to study at the Sorbonne (the University of Paris).” So, it is correct that Marie was able to attend the Sorbonne because of her sister contributed for her financially. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 4: Marie stopped doing research for several years when her children were born. Keywords for the question: stop doing research, children, born, In the beginning of paragraph no. 6, the writer mentions, “The births of Marie’s two daughters, Irene and Eve, in 1897 and 1904 failed to interrupt her scientific work.” So, it’s a false statement that Marie stopped doing her research for some years when her children were born. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 5: Marie took over the teaching position her husband had held. Keywords for the question: took over, teaching position, husband, held, In paragraph no. 7, in lines 3-5, the writer says, “On May 13, 1906, she was appointed to the professorship that had been left vacant on her husband’s death, becoming the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne.” So, the answer is: TRUE Question 6: Marie’s sister Bronia studied the medical uses of radioactivity. Keywords for the question: Bronia, studied, medical uses of radioactivity, There is no mention in this passage on whether Bronia studied radioactivity or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Questions 7-13: (Completing notes with ONE WORD AND/OR A NUMBER): In this type of question, candidates are asked to write only word and/or a number to complete some notes on the given topic. For this type of question, first skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. [TIPS: Here scanning technique will come handy. Target the keywords of the questions to find the answers. Remember to focus on Proper nouns, random Capital letters, numbers, special characters of text etc.] Question 7: When uranium was discovered to be radioactive, Marie Curie found that the element called _________ had the same property. Keywords for the question: uranium, radioactive, element, same property, In paragraph no. 4, in lines 3-4, the writer says, “Marie decided to find out if the radioactivity discovered in uranium was to be found in other elements. She discovered that this was true for thorium.” Here, this was true for = had the same property So, the answer is: thorium Question 8: Marie and Pierre Curie’s research into the radioactivity of the mineral known as _______ led to the discovery of two new elements. Keywords for the question: radioactivity, mineral, known, the discovery of two new elements, In paragraph no. 5, the writer says in lines 1-5, “Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose radioactivity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity. Pierre Curie joined her in the work that she had undertaken to resolve the problem, and that led to the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium.” So, it was the research of pitchblende which further progressed to the discovery of two new elements, polonium and radium. So, the answer is: pitchblende Question 9: In 1911, Marie Curie received recognition for her work on the element ________. Keywords for the question: In 1911, received recognition, element, In paragraph no 7, in the last lines, the author says, “In 1911, she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the isolation of a pure form of radium.” Here, received recognition for = was awarded the Nobel Prize for So, the answer is: radium Question 10: Marie and Irene Curie developed X-radiography which was used as a medical technique for ___________. Keywords for the question: Irene, X-radiography, medical technique for, In paragraph no. 8, in the beginning, the writer says, “During World War I, Marie Curie, with the help of her daughter Irene, devoted herself to the development of the use of X-radiography, including the mobile units which came to be known as ‘Litter Curies’, used for the treatment of wounded soldiers.” Here, medical technique = treatment So, the answer is: soldiers Question 11: Marie Curie saw the importance of collecting radioactive material both for research and for cases of _________. Keywords for the question: importance, collecting radioactive material, research, In paragraph no. 10, the writer indicates in the very beginning, “One of Marie Curie’s outstanding achievements was to have understood the need to accumulate intense radioactive sources, not only to treat illness but also to maintain an abundant supply for research.” Here, saw the importance means understood the need, collect means accumulate, It means that Marie Curie found out the importance of collecting or accumulating radioactive materials for research and treating illness. So, the answer is: illness Question 12: The radioactive material stocked in Paris contributed to the discoveries in the 1930s of the ________ and of what was known as artificial radioactivity. Keywords for the question: radioactive material, Paris, discoveries in the 1930s, artificial radioactivity, In paragraph no. 10, the writer says that “The existence in Paris at the Radium Institute of a stock of 1.5 grams of radium made a decisive contribution to the success of the experiments undertaken in the years around 1930. This work prepared the way for the discovery of the neutron by Sir James Chadwick and, above all, for the discovery in 1934 by Irene and Frederic Joliet-Curie of artificial radioactivity.” Here, made a decisive contribution means contributed to So, the answer is: neutron Question 13: During her research, Marie Curie was exposed to radiation and as a result, she suffered from _________. Keywords for the question: exposed, radiation, suffered from, At the very end of paragraph no. 10, the author says, “A few months after this discovery, Marie Curie died as a result of leukaemia caused by exposure to radiation.” This means that Marie Curie died suffering from leukaemia, as she was exposed to radiation when doing her research. So, the answer is: leukaemia Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Young children’s sense of identity Questions 14-19 (Identifying information): [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first.

Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 14: an account of the method used by researchers in a particular study Keywords for the question: method used, researchers, particular study, In paragraph G, the writer gives reference to a particular study in lines 4-8, “In one experiment, Lewis and Brooks-Gunn (1979) dabbed some red power on the noses of children who were playing in front of a mirror, and then observed how often they touched their noses. The psychologists reasoned that if the children knew what they usually looked like, they would be surprised by the unusual red mark and would start touching it.” Here, a particular study means one experiment So, the answer is: G Buy Cambridge IELTS Series 9 from this link. Question 15: the role of imitation in developing a sense of identity Keywords for the question: imitation, developing, sense of identity, Paragraph C talks about mimicry or imitation by little children. “Another powerful source of information for infants about the effects they can have on the world around them is provided when others mimic them. Many parents spend a lot of time, particularly in the early months, copying their infant’s vocalizations. . … However, Lewis and Brooks-Gunn (1979) suggest that infants’ developing understanding that the movements they see in the mirror are contingent on their own, leads to a growing awareness that they are distinct from other people.” Here, imitate and copying means mimic, developing a sense of identity means are distinct from other people So, the answer is: C Question 16: the age at which children can usually identify a static image of themselves Keywords for the question: age, children, usually identify, static image, themselves, Again, take a look at paragraph G, the writer states in the beginning, “Lewis and Brooks-Gunn argued that an important developmental milestone is reached when children become able to recognise themselves visually without the support of seeing contingent movement. This recognition occurs around their second birthday.” Here, identify a static image of themselves means recognise themselves visually without the support of seeing contingent movement So, the answer is: G Question 17: a reason for the limitations of scientific research into ‘self-as-subject’ Keywords for the question: reason, limitations, research, ‘self-as-subject’, The answer is found in paragraph D. The author says here, “Empirical investigations of the self-as-subject in young children are, however, rather scarce because of difficulties of communication: even if young infants can reflect on their experience, they certainly cannot express this aspect of the self directly.” Here, scarce and cannot express = limitations So, the answer is: D Question 18: reference to a possible link between culture and a particular form of behaviour Keywords for the question: possible link, culture, particular, behaviour, In paragraph H, the author says in the last lines, “Although it may be less marked in other societies, the link between the sense of ‘self’ and of ‘ownership’ is a notable feature of childhood in Western societies.” These lines suggest that there is a possible link between the special behaviour (of ‘self’ and of ‘ownership’) and culture (Western societies). So, the answer is: H Question 19: examples of the wide range of features that contribute to the sense of ‘self-as-object’ Keywords for the question: wide range of features, contribute, sense, ‘self-as-object’, If we skim-read and go to paragraph E, we find the reference of ‘self-as-object’. So, we need to scan this paragraph. In lines 3-4 of the paragraph, the writer says, “This second step in the development of a full sense is what James called the ‘self-as-object’.” Then, at the end of the paragraph, we find the wide range of features that contribute to this sense, “ . .. characteristics which derive their meaning from comparison or interaction with other people (such as trustworthiness, shyness, sporting ability).” So, the answer is: E Questions 20-23: (Matching research findings with the researchers) [In this kind of questions, the candidates have to match the statements which are stated by different researchers given in the list. Candidates must write the correct letter A, B, C, D or E; and not the correct name.] Question 20: A sense of identity can never be formed without relationships with other people. Keywords for the question: sense of identity, never be formed, without relationships, other people, In paragraph F, the writer describes in lines 6-9, “Mead (1934) went even further: the self is essentially a social structure, and it arises in social experience . . .. . . … it is impossible to conceive of a self arising outside of social experience” Here, relationships with other people means social experience So, the answer is: D (Mead) Question 21: A child’s awareness of self is related to a sense of mastery over things and people Keywords for the question: awareness of self, mastery, things, people In paragraph B, the writer says, “Cooley (1902) suggested that a sense of the self-as-subject was primarily concerned with being able to exercise power. He proposed that the earliest examples of this are in infant’s attempts to control physical objects, such as toys and his or her own limbs. This is followed by attempts to affect the behaviour of other people.” Here, sense of the self-as-subject = awareness of self, control physical objects, such as toys and his or her own limbs = mastery over things, So, the answer is: B (Cooley) Question 22: At a certain age, children’s sense of identity leads to aggressive behaviour. Keywords for the question: certain age, aggressive behaviour In paragraph H, the writer states, “In the longitudinal study of groups of three or four children, Bronson (1975) found that the intensity of the frustration and anger in their disagreements increased sharply between the ages of 1 and 2 years.” Here, aggressive behaviour = frustration and anger So, the answer is: E (Bronson) Question 23: Observing their own reflection contributes to children’s self awareness. Keywords for the question: observing, reflection, self awareness In paragraph C, the writer states, “However, Lewis and Brooks-Gunn suggest that infants’ developing understanding that the movements they see in the mirror are contingent on their own, leads to a growing awareness that they are distinct from other people.” Here, movements in the mirror = reflection, see = observe, lead to = contribute to, So, the answer is: C (Lewis and Brooks-Gunn) Questions 24-26 (Completing summary) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete a summary with ONE WORD ONLY from the passage. Keywords are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Title of the summary: How children acquire a sense of identity Question 24: First, children come to realise that they can have an effect on the world around them, for example by handling objects, or causing the image to move when they face a _________. Keywords for this question: effect on the world, handling objects, image, move, face In paragraph C, the writer says in lines 4-5, “.. … . …. young children enjoy looking in mirrors, where the movements they can see are dependent upon their own movements.” The lines suggest that when young children look in the mirrors, they can cause the image to move by moving themselves. So, the answer is: mirror Question 25: This aspect of self awareness is difficult to research directly, because of __________ problems. Keywords for this question: difficult to research, problems, We can find about ‘research difficulties’ in paragraph D. Here, in lines 4-7, the author writes, “Empirical investigations of the self-as-subject in young children are, however, rather scarce because of difficulties of communication: even if young infants can reflect on their experience, they certainly cannot express this aspect of the self directly.” Here, investigations = research, difficult to research = rather scarce, So, the answer is: communication Question 26: In Western societies at least, the development of self awareness is often linked to a sense of _____________, and can lead to disputes.. Keywords for this question: Western, self awareness, linked, At the end of paragraph H, “Although it may be less marked in other societies, the link between the sense of ‘self’ and of ‘ownership’ is a notable feature of childhood in Western societies.” Here, disputes means disagreement So, the answers are: ownership Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: The Development of Museums Questions 27-30 (List of headings): [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,).

And then, he explains the fact that, though many of the historical theme parks and museums are successful in “ . .. . the re-enactment of historical events is increasingly popular, ….”, these developments have been criticized as an intolerable vulgarisation. However, the last lines say, “. . . but the success of many historical theme parks and similar locations suggest that the majority of public does not share this opinion.” This means people have mixed views on the recent changes to museums. So, the answer is: ii (Mixed views on current changes to museums) Buy Cambridge IELTS Series 9 from this link. Question 28: Paragraph C In this paragraph, the author mentions in the first few lines, “In a related development, the sharp distinction between museum and heritage sites, on the one hand, and theme parks on the other, is gradually evaporating. They already borrow ideas and concepts from one another.” These lines suggest that the major differences between historical parks (heritage sites) and museums are decreasing slowly, (the differences are becoming fewer.) After that, he gives some evidence to support his idea. Here, differences means distinction, So, the answer is: vi (Fewer differences between public attractions) Question 29: Paragraph D This paragraph details the writer’s statement that museums and heritages are facing great competition and for that matter experts on museums and histories are under huge amounts of pressure. The reason is explained in these lines, “Museum and heritage experts do not have to invent stories and recreate historical environments to attract their visitors… .. . . However, exhibits must be both based on artifacts and facts as we know them, and attractively presented. Those who are professionally engaged in the art of interpreting history must steer a narrow course between the demands of ‘evidence’ and ‘attractiveness’, especially given the increasing need in the heritage industry for income-generating activities.” These lines clearly suggest that there is a huge commercial pressure on those people who operate museums. Here, people in charge means those who are professionally engaged in the art of interpreting history, So, the answer is: i (Commercial pressures on people in charge) Question 30: Paragraph E The answer for this question lies in the following statements found in paragraph E. “. . . .. . in order to make everything in heritage more real, historical accuracy must be increasingly altered”. (lines 1-2). “……… . : if they did not provide the interpretation, visitors would do it for themselves, based on their own ideas, misconceptions and prejudices. And no matter how exciting the result, it would contain a lot more bias than the presentations provided by experts”. (lines 8-10) These lines suggest that interpretation of the facts related to the exhibits in the museums must be avoided so that visitors do not get biased. So, the answer is: iii (Interpreting the facts to meet visitor expectations) Questions 31-36: (Multiple Choice Questions) [‘Multiple choice questions’ is a common type of question set in IELTS Reading test. It is also found in Listening test. Most of the time, they come with four options but sometimes there are three options. Candidates need to work hard for this type of questions because this may confuse them easily in passage 2 or passage 3. There will be long answers for each question, so they may kill valuable time. So, quick reading or skimming technique might come handy here. Remember that answers in 3 options out of 4 will be very close. So, vocabulary power will help a lot to choose the best answer. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question 31: Compared with today’s museums, those of the past – Keywords for this question: museums, past, In the first paragraph, the writer points out in these lines, “Museums used to look – and some still do – much like storage rooms of objects packed together in showcases: good for scholars who wanted to study the subtle differences in design, but not for the ordinary visitor, to whom it all looked alike.” The lines suggest that back in the past museums were not mainly intended for the general people. Here, the general people means the ordinary visitor So, the answer is: B (were not primarily intended for the public) Question 32: According to the writer, current trends in the heritage industry – Keywords for this question: current trends, heritage industry, In paragraph B, the author says, “On so-called heritage sites the re-enactment of historical events is increasingly popular, and computers will soon provide virtual reality experiences, which will present visitors with a vivid image of the period of their choice, in which they can themselves act as if part of the historical environment.” Here, they can themselves act means personal involvement The lines suggest that present trends in the heritage industry emphasize personal involvement. So, the answer is: A (emphasize personal involvement) Question 33: The writer says that museums, heritage sites and theme parks – Keywords for this question: museums, heritage sites, theme parks, In paragraph C, the writer mentions, “In a related development, the sharp distinction between museum and heritage sites on the one hand, and theme parks on the other, is gradually evaporating.” This means that museums, heritage sites and theme parks are becoming harder to differentiate than before. So, the answer is: D (are less easy to distinguish than before) Question 34: The writer says that in preparing exhibits for museums, experts – Keywords for this question: preparing exhibits, experts, In paragraph D, the author describes, “Museum and heritage experts do not have to invent stories and recreate historical environments to attract their visitors: their assets are already in place. However, exhibits must be both based on artefacts and facts as we know them. Those who are professionally engaged in the art of interpreting history must steer a narrow course between the demands of ‘evidence’ and ‘attractiveness’.. …” The lines suggest that experts must balance conflicting priorities in preparing exhibits for museums. Here, balance = steer a narrow course between, conflicting priorities = evidence and attractiveness, So, the answer is: D (have to balance conflicting priorities) Question 35: In paragraph E, the writer suggests that some museum exhibits – Keywords for this question: Paragraph E, museum exhibits, The answer can be found in paragraph E, the writer says, “Such presentations tell us more about contemporary perceptions of the world than about our ancestors.” This means that museum exhibits expose more about current beliefs than about the past. Here, reveal means tell, present beliefs means contemporary perceptions, the past means our ancestors So, the answer is: C (reveal more about present beliefs than about the past) Question 36: The passage ends by noting that our view of history is biased because – Keywords for this question: view of history, biased, In the final paragraph of the passage, the writer says, “. . . . human bias is inevitable, but another source of bias in the representation of history has to do with the transitory nature of the materials themselves. The simple fact is that not everything from history survives the historical process. Castles, palaces and cathedrals have a longer lifespan than the dwellings of ordinary people.” This means that we have a biased view that only long-lasting objects remain from the past. So, the answer is: B (only very durable objects remain from the past) Questions 37-40: (TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN) In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 37: Consumers prefer theme parks which avoid serious issues. Keywords for this question: prefer theme parks, avoid serious issues, In paragraph D, the author says, “Theme parks are undergoing other changes, too, as they try to present more serious social and cultural issues, and move away from fantasy. This development is in response to market forces… .. .” The lines clearly show that museums are moving towards depicting serious issues. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 38: More people visit museums than theme parks. Keywords for this question: more people visit, museums, theme parks, In this passage, we do not find any comparison on museum visits and theme park visits. In paragraph D, we find comment about competition in presenting more serious issues. The writer says, “… .. . . they are operating in a very competitive environment, where visitors make choices on how and where to spend their free time”. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 39: The boundaries of Leyden have changed little since the seventeenth century. Keywords for this question: boundaries, Leyden, changed little, In the last paragraph, the writer mentions, “In a town like Leyden in Holland, which in the seventeenth century was occupied by approximately the same number of inhabitants as today, people lived within the walled town, an area more than five times smaller than modern Leyden.” Here, more than five times smaller contradicts with the question where it says ‘have changed little. . . .” So, the answer is: FALSE Question 40: Museums can give a false impression of how life used to be. Keywords for this question: museums, give false impression, In the last paragraph, the writer says, “. .. … the evidence in museums indicates that life was so much better in the past. This notion is induced by the bias in its representation in museums and heritage centres.” This means that museums can give a biased information about past lifestyles. So, the answer is: TRUE",

Keywords for these answers: examples of ancient stepwells, all over the world, The answer can be found in paragraph 2 lines 7-11 says, “Most stepwells are found dotted round the desert areas of Gujarat (where they are called vav) and Rajasthan (where they are called baori), while a few also survive in Delhi.” This means that stepwells are unique to India, so they cannot be found all around the world. So, the answers are: FALSE Question 2: Stepwells had a range of functions, in addition to those related to water collection. Keywords for these answers: range of functions, in addition to, water collection, The answer can be found in paragraph 2 lines 11-14 says, “Some were located in or near villages as public spaces for the community; others were positioned beside roads as resting places for travelers.” In the same paragraph, the writer also says in the previous lines, “During their heyday, they (stepwells) were places of gathering of leisure and relaxation and of worship for villagers of all but the lowest classes.” This means that stepwells were not only used for collecting water. They were also used for other social purposes. So, the answers are: TRUE Question 3: The few existing stepwells in Delhi are more attractive than those found elsewhere. Keywords for this answer: few existing, Delhi, more attractive In this passage, there is no comparison on the decorations of the stepwells. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 4: It took workers many years to build the stone steps characteristic of stepwells. Keywords for this answer: stone steps characteristic, We can find the mention of ‘stone steps’ in both paragraph 3 and 4. However, no paragraph indicates whether it took the workers many years or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 5: The number of steps above the water level in a stepwell altered during the course of a year. Keywords for this answer: number of steps, altered, course of a year, In paragraph 3 lines 6-9, the author mentions, “When the water level was high, the user needed only to descend a few steps to reach it; when it was low, several levels would have to be negotiated.” These lines suggest that the water level changed during the year, which means that the number of steps above the water level changed, too. So, the answer is: TRUE Questions 6-8: Short answer to open questions In this kind of questions, candidates have to answer some questions, only with some conditions like NO MORE THAN THREE/TWO WORDS and/or A NUMBER or, ONE WORD ONLY. Each question has keywords which will lead to the answer. This question type generally follows a sequence. Question 6: Which part of some stepwells provided shade for people? Keywords for the answer: shade The answers can be found in lines 6-8 of paragraph no. 4, where the writer says, “Built from stone and supported by pillars, they also included pavilions that sheltered visitors from the relentless heat.” Here, sheltered visitors from the relentless heat = provided shade So, the answer is: pavilions Question 7: What type of serious climatic event, which took place in southern Rajasthan, is mentioned in the article? Keywords for these answers: serious climate event, southern Rajasthan, The answers can be found in the last lines of paragraph no. 5. The writer says, “. .. . . .southern Rajasthan suffered an eight-year drought between 1996 and 2004.” We know that drought is a serious climate event. So, the answer is: drought Question 8: Who are frequent visitors to stepwells nowadays? Keywords for this answer: frequent visitors, nowadays, The word ‘nowadays’ indicates the present tense. So, we need to find the recent information about stepwells. The final paragraph starts with the word ‘today’ which indicates the present tense. So, we need to check here for the answer. In lines 6-8 of the final paragraph the writer says, “. .. .. .. . Tourists flock to wells . .. .” Here, the word flock means visit frequently. So, the answer is: tourists Questions 9-13 (Table completion): In this type of question, candidates are asked to fill in the blanks in a table. It is one of the easiest questions because many keywords are available to find the answers. Question 9: Other notes: Restored in the 1960s. Excellent condition, despite the _________ of 2001. Keywords for this answer: Rani Ki Vav, Restored, 1960s, excellent condition, despite, 2001, To find the answer for this question, let’s find the times 1960s and 2001. In paragraph no. 7 we can find both the times 1960s (line 7) and 2001 (line 14). Now, let’s read the last lines in this paragraph, “Incredibly, in January 2001, this ancient structure survived an earthquake that measured 7.6 on the Richter scale.” So, the stepwell remained in excellent condition even though/despite it suffered an earthquake. So, the answer is: earthquake Question 10: Features: Steps on the __________ produce a geometrical pattern. Keywords for this answer: Surya Kund, produce, geometrical pattern, The answer can be found in lines 8-10 of paragraph no. 8. The author says here, “. . .. Besides, it is the steps on the four sides that create a geometrical formation.” So, the answer is: 4 sides (four sides is not the answer because of the given condition in the instruction) Question 11: Other notes: Looks more like a _______ than a well. Keywords for these answers: Surya Kund, looks more like, The answer can be found in lines 4-6 of paragraph no. 8. The author says here, “It actually resembles a tank rather than a well,. . .” Here, resembles = look more like So, the answer is: tank Question 12: Other notes: Old, deep and very dramatic Has ________ which provide a view of the steps Keywords for this answer: Chand baori, old, deep, dramatic, provide, view of the steps, In paragraph 10, the last lines have the answer for this question. “On the fourth side, verandas which are supported by ornate pillars overlook the steps.” The same paragraph has the words like oldest, deepest, most dramatic. Here, overlook the steps = provide a view of the steps. So, the answer is: verandas Question 13: Features: Has two ______ levels Keywords for this answer: Neemrana Ki Baori, two, In paragraph 11, lines 4-5 give us the answer. “. .. .storeys deep, with the last two being underwater.” So the answer is: underwater Reading Passage 1: The headline of the passage: European Transport System 1990-2010 Questions 14-18: (List of headings) [To find answers for List of Headings, check the first and (occasionally) the last few lines of each paragraph. Most of the time, the answer is there for you containing some synonymous words, which have a match with the lists of headings. If you cannot find the answers in the first and last few lines, you may need to check the middle of the paragraphs. This we did in other tests too.] Question 14: Paragraph A In paragraph A, the author states in lines 2-4 “Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport continues to increase.” Also in lines 6-7, the author says, “The number of cars on European Union (EU) roads saw an increase of three million cars each year from 1990 to 2010, … .. . ..” This means that the requirement for vehicles continues to rise. So, the answer is: viii (The rapid growth of private transport) Question 15: Paragraph B In paragraph B, the first sentence gives us the main clue “As far as goods transport is concerned, growth is due to a large extent to changes in the European economy and its system of production.” Right after that, the author also suggests that these changes are the reason of some production sites to be shifted far away from the final assembly plant or away from users, “ –even though the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away… ..”. These lines means that these changes clearly affect the transport distances. So, the answer is: iii (Changes affecting the distances goods may be transported) Question 16: Paragraph C In paragraph C, some important transport statistics is provided by the author, in some nations which wish to enter the EU, “….candidates for entry to the EU”. The statistics show a clear increase in road transport and a decrease in rail transport. So, the answer is: xi (Transport trends in the countries awaiting EU admission) Question 17: Paragraph D In paragraph D, after the first line “A new imperative – sustainable development- offers an opportunity for adapting the EU’s common transport policy.. .. ”, we find the word objective. And in the last line we find the time needed to implement the objective “… in 30 years’ time.” Objective = goal In 30 years’ time = long-term So, the answer is: i (A fresh and important long-term goal) Question 18: Paragraph E In paragraph E, we can see the mention of the effect of energy consumption in the transport sector on the environment. This is specified by the statistic provided on CO2 (carbon-di-oxide). The paragraph says that CO2 emissions are projected to rise by 50% by 2020 because of the increase in traffic. So, the environment is paying heavily for the increase of CO2. So, the answer is: v (The environmental cost of road transport) Question 19: Paragraph G Paragraph G proposes a solution that concentrates on road transport only through pricing. This is because the previous paragraph (paragraph E) talks about transport rebalance. charging=pricing alone=solely restrict=curb So, the answer is: x (Restricting road use through charging policies alone) Question 20: Paragraph H Paragraph H is also about another solution to achieve transport balance. Here, the approach is to concentrate “… .. .on road transport pricing but is accompanied by measures to increase the efficiency of the other modes (better quality of services, logistics, technology.)”. Here, other modes mean other transport methods. So, the answer is: ii (Charging for roads and improving other transport methods) Question 21: Paragraph I Paragraph I specifically talks about the change needed to restructure the modes of transport and the transport network. Look at the first two lines “the third approach comprises a series of measures ranging from pricing to revitalising alternative modes of transport and targeting investment in the trans-European network… … ” So, the answer is: iv (Taking all the steps necessary to change transport patterns) Question 22-26: (TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN) In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN Question 22: The need for transport is growing, despite technological developments. Keywords for this answer: growing, technological developments, In paragraph A, look at these lines, “Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport continues to rise.” So, the main indication here is “the requirement or need for transport is rising”. In this paragraph, requirement means need rise means grow information technologies means technological developments So, the answer is: TRUE Question 23: To reduce production costs, some industries have been moved closer to their relevant customers. Keywords for this answer: reduce production costs, closer to customers The answer is found in paragraph B. “This phenomenon has been emphasized by the relocation of some industries, particularly those which are labour intensive, to reduce production costs, even though the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final assembly or away from users.” This means that some industries are moved much far away from their relevant customers, not moved closer. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 24: Cars are prohibitively expensive in some EU candidate countries. Keywords for this answer: prohibitively expensive, candidate countries. The phrase “EU candidate countries” is mentioned in paragraph C. However, there is no mention of any information about the price of EU countries’ cars or any indication of whether they are expensive or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 25: The Gothenburg European Council was set up 30 years ago. Keywords for this answer: The Gothenburg Council, 30 years ago In Paragraph D, we find the mention of The Gothenburg Council. However, there is no information about the founding time of the Gothenburg Council in this paragraph or the following paragraph. Don’t be fooled by the mention of ’30 years’ at the end of paragraph D. It indicates to the time needed to complete the objective of sustainable development. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 26: By the end of this decade, CO2 emissions from transport are predicted to reach 739 billion tonnes. Keywords for this answer: the end of this decade, 739 billion tonnes, In paragraph E, the writer argues that “… .. CO2 emissions from transport can be expected to increase by 50% to 1,113 billion tonnes, compared with the 739 billion tonnes recorded in 1990.” This means that 739 billion tonnes is the figure or CO2 emissions in 1990, not “by the end of this decade”. So, the answer is: FALSE Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: The psychology of innovation Questions 27-30 (Multiple Choice Questions) [Multiple choice questions is a common type of question set in IELTS Reading test. It is also found in Listening test. Most of the time, they come with four options but sometimes there are three options.

A quick skimming of the paragraph lets us know that ‘million-dollar quartet’ was, in fact, a famous picture of four great “….. … singers Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Jonny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis jamming at a piano in Sun Studios in Memphis …. .. .” However, the paragraph also points out that the picture missed another great singer of the time who was Roy Orbison. The four singers joined hands together at Sun Studios under Sam Phillips, but ‘… .. . Orbison wasn’t inspired by the goal, and only ever achieved one hit with the Sun label’. This means Orbison did not like the idea of sharing success. So, the answer is: C (having a shared objective) Question 28: James Watson suggests that he and Francis Crick won the race to discover the DNA code because they – Keywords for this question: James Watson, Francis Crick, won, discover the DNA code, In paragraph no. 6 we find the mention of James Watson and Francis Crick, the great minds who discovered DNA code. Here, in this paragraph, look at lines 18-20. “….. he (James Watson) and Crick had succeeded because they were aware that they weren’t the most intelligent of the scientists pursuing the answer.” It means both James Watson and Francis Crick knew that they had learning limitations. So, the answer is: A (were conscious of their own limitations) Question 29: The writer mentions competitions on breakfast cereal packets as an example of how to – Keywords for this question: competitions on breakfast cereal packets In paragraph no. 8, ‘competitions on breakfast cereal packets’ is mentioned in lines 8-9. The reason of mentioning this example is described just before. In lines 5-7, the writer says, “….. . . even something as simple as writing deepens every individual’s engagement in the project.” So, the answer is: D (strengthen commitment to an idea) Question 30: In the last paragraph, the writer suggests that it is important for employees to – Keywords for this question: important for employees to In the middle of the last paragraph, lines 4-9, we find the final comments of Cialdini. “ … … Cialdini says: ‘Leaders should encourage everyone to contribute and simultaneously assure all concerned that every recommendation is important to making the right decision and will be given full attention.’ … ..” This means that company owners or employers should provide a view to their employees that they (employees) are also a big part of the company and their suggestions are valued. So, the answer is: B (feel that their contributions are valued) Questions 31-35 (Completing sentences with correct endings) [For this type of question, candidates need to match the beginning and ending of sentences. Candidates need to look for keywords in the sentence-beginnings and find the relative paragraphs and then sentences in the passage. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question 31: Employees whose values match those of their employers are more likely to – Keywords for this question: values, match, more likely to, In paragraph no. 2, the writer says in lines 5-12, “. . . .. . Research shows that the fit between an employee’s values and a company’s values makes difference to what contribution they make and whether they’re still at the company”. This clearly suggests that the matching or fitting of value has an influence on whether employees stay in their present jobs or not. So, the answer is: G (remain in their jobs) Question 32: At times of change, people tend to – Keywords for this question: time of change, In paragraph no. 4, the writer mentions in lines 4-6, “ . .. .. when things change, we are hard-wired to play it safe.” This line suggests that when there are changes we or people try our best to play safe or avoid risks. So, the answer is: E (avoid risk) Question 33: If people are aware of what they might lose, they will often – Keywords for this question: if, aware, might lose, will often At the end of paragraph no. 4 the writer says, “.. .. . studies show that we invariably take more gambles when threatened with a loss than when offered a reward”. This means that when people are threatened with a loss or damage, people will take gambles or chances. So, the answer is: A (take chances) Question 34: People working under a dominant boss are liable to – Keywords for this answer: dominant boss, liable to, In paragraph no. 9, lines 7-11, we find comments of Cialdini, “. .. . crew members of multipilot aircraft exhibit a sometimes deadly passivity when the flight captain makes a clearly wrong-headed decision. This behaviour is not unique to air travel, but can happen in any workplace where the leader is overbearing.” These lines indicate the fact that people working under an overbearing or dominant boss tend to take more passive decision or action. To be more precise, they become liable to ignore their duties. So, the answer is: F (ignore their duties) Question 35: Employees working in organisations with few rules are more likely to – Keywords for this answer: employees, with few rules We find the answer in paragraph no. 10 Here, the writer specifies that the environment ‘. .. . where the only rule was that there were no rules.. ..’ … … .. . ‘.. . .encouraged a free interchange of ideas…. ..’ *interchange = share This means that employees who work in organisations with few rules are more likely to interchange or share their ideas. So, the answer is: B (share their ideas) Questions 36-40 (YES/NO/NOT GIVEN): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 36: The physical surroundings in which a person works play a key role in determining their creativity. Keywords for this answer: surroundings, determining creativity In paragraph no. 1, lines 3-9 say, “There are, nevertheless, people working in luxurious, state-of-the-art centres designed to stimulate innovation who find that their environment doesn’t make them feel at all creative. And there are those who don’t have a budget, or much space, but who innovate successfully.” This means that the working environment or physical surroundings of the workplace does not affect the employees’ creativity. So, the answer is: NO Question 37: Most people have the potential to be creative. Keywords for this answer: potential, creative, In paragraph no. 2, lines 11-14, the writer says, “… . .. . although some individuals may be more creative than others, almost every individual can be creative in the right circumstances.” The lines clearly agree with the statement. So, the answer is: YES Question 38: Teams work best when their members are of equally matched intelligence. Keywords for this answer: work best, equally matched intelligence We find reference of team work in paragraph no. 7. However, there is no mention of whether teamwork gives the best work result when team members are equally intelligent. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 39: It is easier for smaller companies to be innovative. Keywords for this answer: easier, smaller companies, innovative Again, in paragraph 5, the author only argues in lines 2-6, “It’s easy for a company to be pulled in conflicting directions as the marketing, product development, and finance departments each get different feedback from different sets of people.” The author also says in lines 8-10, “… .. .it’s also easy for small ‘pockets of innovation’ to disappear.” Therefore, ‘whether it is easy or difficult for smaller companies to be creative or innovative’ is not clearly mentioned here. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 40: A manager’s approval of an idea is more persuasive than that of a colleague. Keywords for this answer: manager’s approval, more persuasive At the last part of paragraph no. 7, the writer mentions in lines 8-11, “.. . . Research shows that peer power, used horizontally not vertically, is much more powerful than any boss’s speech.” So, the statement clearly contradicts with the view of the writer. It means a colleague or peer’s speech is more persuasive or powerful than a boss. So, the answer is: NO",

Most of the time, the answer is there for you containing some synonymous words, which have a match with the lists of headings. If you cannot find the answers in the first and last few lines, you may need to check the middle of the paragraphs. This we did in other tests too.] Question 1: Paragraph A The answer can be found in the last lines of paragraph A. Here, the author asks, “Why did this particular Big Bang-the world-changing birth of industry – happen in Britain? And why did it strike at the end of the 18 century?” These questions give us the hint about the place and the time of Industrial Revolution. So, the answer is: iv (The time and place of the Industrial Revolution) Question 2: Paragraph B The answer can be found in paragraph B, lines 1-2 says, “There are about 20 different factors and all of them need to be present before the revolution can happen.” Then the writer mention the factors such as technology, power, cheap labour, easy transportation, market-driven economy, political system etc. All of these factors are the conditions required for Industrial Revolution. So, the answer is: viii (Conditions required for industrialisation) Question 3: Paragraph C The answer is found in paragraph C, lines 1 and 2 mentions the missing conditions or factors, “Tea and beer, two of the nation’s favorite drinks, fueled the revolution.” Then the author explains why they were the keys or important factors, “The antiseptic properties of tannin, the active ingredient in tea, and of hops in beer – plus the fact that both are made with boiled water – allowed urban communities to flourish at close quarters without succumbing to water-borne diseases such as dysentery.” So, the answer is: vii (Two keys to Britain’s industrial revolution) Question 4: Paragraph D In the first lines of paragraph D the writer says, “Macfarlane had wondered for a long time how the Industrial Revolution came about.” This line suggests that Macfarlane was searching the reason behind the revolution. Then in lines 3-4, the writer says, “Between about 1650 and 1740, the population in Britain was static. But then there was a burst in population growth.” Then in the following lines he lists four questions which were suggested as causes of this burst. So, the answer is: i (The search for the reasons for an increase in population) Question 5: Paragraph E In paragraph E lines 7-11, the author mentions, “For a long time, the English were protected by the strong antibacterial agent in hops, which were added to help preserve the beer. But in the late 17th century a tax was introduced on malt, the basic ingredient of beer. The poor turned to water and gin and in the 1720s, the mortality rate began to rise again. Then it suddenly dropped again.” This means that the English changed their habit of drinking, which, in return, changed the mortality rate too. So, the answer is: vi (Changes in drinking habits in Britain) Question 6: Paragraph F Paragraph F starts with the line, “Macfarlane looked to Japan, . .. .” Then in the following lines we find a comparison between Japan and Britain. … . “Water-borne disease had a much looser grip on the Japanese population than those in Britain.” Thus Macfarlane was able to find out that “. .. . . the history of tea in Britain provided an extraordinary coincidence of dates”. So, the answer is: ix (Comparisons with Japan lead to the answer) Question 7: Paragraph G The answer is in lines 3-5 where the author says, “ . .. . it had turned its back on the essence of any work-based revolution by giving up labour-saving devices such as animals, afraid that they would put people put of work.” This means fear of unemployment because of industrialisation. So, the answer is: ii (Industrialisation and the fear of unemployment) Questions 8-13: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 8: China’s transport system was not suitable for industry in the 18th century. Keywords for the answer: China, transport, not suitable, 18th century Though the writer mentions the country China in paragraph B and F; and China and 18th century are also mentioned in Paragraph F; we cannot find any mention of transport system in China anywhere in the paragraphs. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 9: Tea and beer both helped to prevent dysentery in Britain. Keywords for these answers: tea, beer, both, helped, prevent dysentery Remember reading lines from Paragraph C for list of headings? “The antiseptic properties of tannin, the active ingredient in tea, and of hops in beer – plus the fact that both are made with boiled water – allowed urban communities to flourish at close quarters without succumbing to water-borne diseases such as dysentery.” These lines suggest that antiseptic properties in tea and beer helped to prevent dysentery in urban communities though they lived in close quarters. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 10: Roy Porter disagrees with Professor Macfarlane’s findings. Keywords for this answer: Roy Porter, disagree, Macfarlane At the end of paragraph C, the author says, “Macfarlane’s case has been strengthened by support from notable quarters- Roy Porter…. . .. . ”. This line suggests that Roy Porter agreed and supported with Professor Macfarlane’s findings. The statement contradicts with the question. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 11: After 1740, there was a reduction in population in Britain. Keywords for this answer: After 1740, reduction, population, Britain In paragraph D, lines 3-4 say, “Between 1650 and 1740, the population in Britain was static. But then there was a burst in population growth.” This means that after 1740, there was a huge increase in population in Britain. The statement contradicts with the question. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 12: People in Britain used to make beer at home. Keywords for this answer: Britain, make beer, at home Though drinking beer is mentioned in paragraphs C and E, there is no such information that makes it clear to understand that people in Britain used to make beer at their homes. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 13: The tax on malt indirectly caused a rise in the death rate. Keywords for this answer: tax on malt, indirectly caused, rise, death rate We find the mention of tax and death rate at the end of paragraph E, “But in the late 17 century, a tax was introduced on malt, the basic ingredient of beer. The poor turned to water and gin and in the 1720s the mortality rate began to rise again.” This clearly suggests that the introduction of tax on malt led poor people to stop drinking beer and started to drink water and gin, which caused a rise in the mortality rate / death rate. So, the answer is: TRUE Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Gifted children and learning Questions 14-17 (Identifying information): [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. For this passage, first answer question 4- 13. After finishing with these questions, come to question 1-3. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 14: a reference to the influence of the domestic background on the gifted child. Keywords for this question: influence, domestic background, gifted child In paragraph A, the author mentions the importance of ‘home educational provision’ and ‘reported verbal interactions with parents, number of books and activities in their home etc.’ Take a look at the lines 4-6, “For example, a very close positive relationship was found when children’s IQ scores were compared with their home educational provision (Freeman, 2010)”. These suggest the fact that home or domestic background of a gifted child has a great influence on him/her. So, the answer is: A Question 15: reference to what can be lost if learners are given too much guidance Keywords for this question: what can be lost, learners given, too much guidance Look at lines 2-3 of paragraph D. The author says, “Conversely, teachers who have a tendency to ‘overdirect’ can diminish their gifted pupils’ learning autonomy.” The line means that if a gifted child is ‘overdirected’ / given too much guidance by their teachers, the gifted pupils’/ learners’ autonomy / independence is badly affected. So, the answer is: D Question 16: a reference to the damaging effects of anxiety Keywords for this question: effects, anxiety In paragraph F, the author directly argues in lines 3-5, “Fear, for example, can limit the development of curiosity, which is a strong force in scientific advance, because it motivates problem-solving behaviour.” So, fear (synonymous to anxiety) has negative effects on the development of curiosity. So, the answer is: F Question 17: examples of classroom techniques which favour socially-disadvantaged children Keywords for this question: techniques, socially-disadvantaged children Take a look at the last few lines of paragraph D, “There are quite a number of new methods which can help, such as child-initiated learning, ability-peer tutoring, etc. Such practices have been found to be particularly useful for bright children from deprived areas.” Here, new methods = classroom techniques, favour = found to be particularly useful, socially-disadvantaged children = children from deprived areas. So, the answer is: D Questions 18-22 (Matching statements with correct person or people): (The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the keywords and read around different names of people or person carefully. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same person in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions may not follow any sequential order. ) Question 18: Less time can be spent on exercises with gifted pupils who produce accurate work. Keywords for this question: less time, exercises, gifted pupils, produce accurate work In paragraph C, we find the results done by Shore and Kanevsky in 1993. The lines say, “If they (the gifted) merely think more quickly, then we need only teach more quickly. If they merely make fewer errors, then we can shorten the practice.” Here, make fewer errors = produce accurate work, shorten the practice = less time spent on exercises So, the answer is: B (Shore and Kanevsky) Question 19: Self-reliance is a valuable tool that helps gifted students reach their goals. Keywords for this question: self-reliance, valuable tool, reach, goals In paragraph E, we find the research findings of Simonton in 1988 who came “ . . .. . … to the conclusion that above a certain high level, characteristics such as independence seemed to contribute more to reaching the highest levels of expertise than intellectual skills, due to the great demands of effort and time needed for learning and practice.” The lines suggest that independence or self-reliance contributes more or helps a lot to reach the highest level or goal. So, the answer is: D (Simonton) Question 20: Gifted children know how to channel their feelings to assist their learning. Keywords for this question: channel feelings, assist learning Take a look at the last lines of the last paragraph, “In Boekaerts’ (1991) review of emotion in the learning of very high IQ and highly achieving children, she found emotional forces in harness. They (which mean the gifted children) were not only curious, but often had a strong desire to control their environment, improve their learning efficiency, and increase their own learning resources.” These lines mean that gifted children actually know to control their learning environment which helps them better to learn more. Here, emotional forces in harness = channel their feelings, improve their learning efficiency = assist their learning So, the answer is: E (Boekaerts) Question 21: The very gifted child benefits from appropriate support from close relatives. Keywords for this question: benefits, support from close relatives In paragraph A we find about close relatives’ support from the research of Freeman (2010). Look at lines 7-9, “The higher the children’s IQ scores, especially over IQ 130, the better the quality of their educational backup, measured in terms of reported verbal interactions with parents, number of books and activities in their home, etc.” Here, parents are the close relatives who support gifted children to learn. So, the answer is: A (Freeman) Question 22: Really successful students have learnt a considerable amount about their subject. Keywords for this question: learn, considerable amount, about their subject In paragraph E, the second and third lines are the findings of Elshout (1995) “… .. individuals who know a great deal about a specific domain will achieve at a higher level than those who do not.” Here, know a great deal = have learnt a considerable amount, a specific domain = their subject, achieve at a higher level = really successful, So, the answer is: C (Elshout) Questions 23-26: (Completing sentences with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to write no more than two words to complete sentences on the given topic. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word/words.] Question 23: One study found a strong connection between children’s IQ and the availability of _________ and ________ at home. Keywords for this answer: connection, children’s IQ, at home Look at paragraph A where the writer argues that “A very close positive relationship was found when children’s IQ scores were compared with their home educational provision. The higher the children’s IQ scores, especially over IQ 130, the better the quality of their educational backup, measured in terms of reported verbal interactions with parents, number of books and activities in their home, etc.” Here, A very close positive relationship = a strong connection So, the answers are: books, activities Question 24: Children of average ability seem to need more direction from teachers because they do not have ________. Keywords for this answer: average ability, more direction, they do not have, In paragraph B, the author mentions in lines 4-7, “There appears to be a qualitative difference in the way the intellectually highly able think, compared with more average-ability or older pupils, for whom external regulation by the teachers often compensates for lack of internal regulation.” Here, external regulation = more direction, lack of = do not have, So, the answer is: internal regulation Question 25: Metacognition involves children understanding their own learning strategies, as well as developing __________. Keywords for this answer: Metacognition, children understanding, learning strategies, developing, In paragraph B, “To be at their most effective in their self-regulation, all children can be helped to identify their own ways of learning – metacognition – which include strategies of planning, monitoring, evaluation, and choice of what to learn. Emotional awareness is also part of metacognition, so children should be helped to be aware of their feelings around the area to be learned.” So, the lines suggest that along with the learning strategies, metacognition includes emotional awareness. So, the answer is: emotional awareness Question 26: Teachers who rely on what is known as _________ often produce sets of impressive grades in class tests. Keywords for this answer: rely on, produce impressive grades, tests, In paragraph D we find in the first lines talk about teachers’ directing gifted children. Then in lines 3-4 the writer says, “Although ‘spoon-feeding’ can produce extremely high examination results, .. …. .. . ” Here, extremely high examination results = sets of impressive grades in class tests So, the answer is: spoon-feeding IELTS Academic Reading: Cambridge 10 Test 2; Reading passage 3; Museums of fine art and their public; with best solutions and explanations April 14, 2019April 14, 2019 by IELTSdeal This IELTS Reading post focuses on all the solutions for IELTS Cambridge 10 Reading Test 2 passage 3 which is entitled ‘Museums of fine art and their public’.

IELTS Cambridge 10 Test 2: AC Reading Module The headline of the passage: Museums of fine art and their public Questions 27-31 (Summary completion using list of words) (In this kind of questions candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. As these are Fill in the blanks or gaps, there is a condition of writing the words from the given list of words for each answer. The words are given with letters and candidates must fill in the blanks with the correct letter, not the word/words. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers to fill in the gaps.) Question 27 and 28: People go to art museums because they accept the value of seeing an original work of art. But they do not go to museums to read original manuscripts of novels, perhaps because the availability of novels has depended on 27. __________ for so long, and also because with novels, the 28. _________are the most important thing. Question 27: Keywords for this question: museums, novels, For this question, we have to find out the reason people do not go to museums to read original manuscripts of novels. Let’s have a look at the second paragraph because we find the word ‘novel’ in this paragraph. At the beginning of paragraph 2, the writer says in lines 5-10, “This might be explained by the fact that the novel has evolved precisely because of technological developments that made it possible to printout huge numbers of texts, whereas oil paintings have always been produced as unique objects.” This means people do not need to go to museums to read novel manuscripts because novels are now available as a huge production of printed documents. Here, to printout huge numbers of texts = mass production So, the answer is: B (mass production) Question 28: Keywords for this question: novels, most important, To find answer to this question, we need to move to lines 13-16 of paragraph 2. Here the writer makes another comment about novels. “With novels, the reader attends mainly to the meaning of words rather than the way they are printed on the page.” These lines clearly indicate that the reader finds the meaning of words most important. Here, most important = mainly, the meaning of words = underlying ideas So, the answer is: H (underlying ideas) Questions 29-30: However, in historical times, artists such as Leonardo were happy to instruct 29. _________to produce copies of their work and these days new methods of reproduction allow excellent replication of surface relief features as well as colour and 30. __________. Question 29: Keywords for this question: artists, instruct, copies Let’s take a look at paragraph 3 for this question. The author talks about artists here and says that “…in the 16th century, artists seemed perfectly content to assign the reproduction of their creations to their workshop apprentices as regular ‘bread and butter’ work.” Here, content = happy, workshop apprentices = assistants, reproduction = copy So, the answer is: L (assistants) Question 30: Keywords for this question: excellent replication, colour, surface relief The last part of paragraph 3 says, “And today the task of reproducing pictures is incomparably more simple and reliable, with reprographic techniques that allow the production of high-quality prints made exactly to the original scale, with faithful colour values, and even with duplication of the surface relief of the painting.” The lines mean that along with the surface relief features and faithful colour values, new methods allow the copies made exactly to the original scale or the original size. Here, reproducing = replication, today = these days So, the answer is: G (size) Question 31: It is regrettable that museums still promote the superiority of original works of art, since this may not be in the interests of the ____________. Keywords for this question: promote, original works, not in the interests of In paragraph 5, “Unfortunately, this seems to place severe limitations on the kind of experience offered to visitors.” The line suggests that it is an unfortunate or regrettable matter that museums still highlight or promote the most superior types of arts because general visitors do not have a great interest in them. Here, regrettable = unfortunately, severe limitations on the kind of experience offered = may not be in the interests of, visitors = the public So, the answer is: D (public) Questions 32-35 (Multiple choice questions) [‘Multiple choice questions’ is a common type of question set in IELTS Reading test. It is also found in Listening test. Most of the time, they come with four options but sometimes there are three options. Candidates need to work hard for this type of questions because this may confuse them easily in passage 2 or passage 3. There will be long answers for each question, so they may kill valuable time. So, quick reading or skimming technique might come handy here. Remember that answers in 3 options out of 4 will be very close. So, vocabulary power will help a lot to choose the best answer. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question 32: The writer mentions London’s National Gallery to illustrate — Keywords for this question: London’s National Gallery To find the answer to this question, let’s find out the mention of London’s National Gallery. Take a look at paragraph 6. Here the author says, “In addition, a major collection like that of London’s National Gallery is housed in numerous rooms, each with dozens of works, any one of which is likely to be worth more than all the average visitor possesses. In a society that judges the personal status of the individual so much by their material worth, it is therefore difficult not to be impressed by one’s own relative ‘worthlessness’ in such an environment.” These lines suggest the fact that London’s National Gallery is mentioned to demonstrate the adverse / negative effect a museum can have on visitors’ opinions of themselves. Here, one’s own relative ‘worthlessness’ = negative So, the answer is: C Question 33: The writer says that today, viewers may be unwilling to criticise a work because — Keywords for this question: unwilling, criticise a work Read quickly paragraph 7, “…since these works were originally produced, they have been assigned a huge monetary value by some person or institution more powerful than themselves.” These lines talk about the strong power behind the artworks and their maintenance in the museum. Then read the following lines, “Evidently, nothing the viewer thinks about the work is going to alter the value, and so today’s viewer is deterred from trying to extend that spontaneous, immediate, self-reliant kind of reading which would originally have met work.” Now, these lines clearly show that the viewers or audiences in a museum feel that their opinion is of no importance or significance / nothing the viewer thinks about the work is going to alter the value and so they are deterred from trying to give any opinion. So, the answer is: D Question 34: According to the writer, the „displacement effect‟ on the visitor is caused by – Keywords for this question: displacement effect, caused by The answer is in paragraph 8. Here, the writer says at the very beginning, “The visitor may be struck by the strangeness of seeing such diverse paintings, drawings and sculptures brought together in an environment for which they were not originally created. This ‘displacement effect’ . … .. . .. .. ” These lines describe what displacement effect is. It means the variety of works placed and arranged somewhere they are not created for. So, the answer is: A Question 35: The writer says that unlike other forms of art, a painting does not – Keywords for this question: unlike other forms of art, a painting does not Take a close look at the first lines in paragraph 9 where the writer differentiates between paintings and other arts. “A fundamental difference between paintings and other forms is that there is no prescribed time over which a painting is viewed.” Then again in lines 11-13, “whereas a picture has no clear place at which to start viewing, or at which to finish.” So, the lines explain the fact that the difference between other forms of arts and a painting is that a painting has no specific start or end. So, the answer is: D Questions 36-40 (YES/NO/NOT GIVEN): In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer. Question 36: Art history should focus on discovering the meaning of art using a range of media. Keywords for this question: art history, meaning of art, media We find the mention of art history/historian in paragraph 10. “Consequently, the dominant critical approach becomes that of the art historian, a specialised academic approach devoted to ‘discovering the meaning’ of art within the cultural context of its time”. So, it means it has become common for art historians to devote themselves to discovering the meaning. But the lines do not tell us whether art history should focus on meaning or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 37: The approach of art historians conflicts with that of art museums. Keywords for this question: approach, art historians, conflicts, art museums. For the previous question we found that art historians devote themselves on discovering the meaning of art forms. Now, look at the lines 5-6 of paragraph 10, “This is in perfect harmony with the museum’s function, since . . . .. . . .” So, this line suggests that there is a ‘harmony’ between art historian’s approach and the function of art museum. The word ‘harmony’ is the exact antonym/ opposite of ‘conflict’. So, the answer is: NO Question 38: People should be encouraged to give their opinions openly on works of art. Keywords for this question: should be encouraged, give, opinions openly, Take a look at the last paragraph, lines 4-7, “The museum public, like any other audience, experience art more rewardingly when given the confidence to express their views.” The lines suggest that if people provide their opinions about works of art, the museums can benefit from this. So, this is an encouragement for people to provide opinions. Here, express their views means to give their opinions. So, the answer is: YES Question 39: Reproductions of fine art should only be sold to the public if they are of high quality. Keywords for this question: reproductions, should only be sold, high quality We find the discussion about reproductions of fine art in the last paragraph. “If appropriate works of fine art could be rendered permanently accessible to the public by means of high-fidelity reproductions, as literature and music already are, the public may feel somewhat less in awe of them.” There is no information about “selling fine art reproductions to the public”. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 40: In the future, those with power are likely to encourage more people to enjoy art. Keywords for this question: future, power, encourage, enjoy art Take a look at the very last line of the last paragraph, “Unfortunately, that may be too much to ask from those who seek to maintain and control the art establishment.” The line means it is a very unfortunate matter that it is not a very good idea (too much to ask) to ask people with power to establish and maintain museums to encourage people to enjoy art. So, the answer is: NO",

Most of the time, the answer is there for you containing some synonymous words, which have a match with the lists of headings. If you cannot find the answers in the first and last few lines, you may need to check the middle of the paragraphs. This we did in other tests too.] Question 1: Paragraph B In the first line of Paragraph B the author talks about tourism. Then in the second line, the author says, “.. .. Historians suggest that the advent of mass tourism began in England during the industrial revolution with the rise of the middle class and the availability of relatively inexpensive transportation.” Then the author talks about the creation of commercial airline industry…. . And then, “… .. This growth led to the development of a major new industry: tourism.” So, the answer is: ii (The development of mass tourism) Question 2: Paragraph C Read only the first line of paragraph C. “Tourism today has grown significantly in both economic and social importance.” This first line is the main idea of the whole paragraph. So, the answer is: i (Economic and social significance of tourism) Question 3: Paragraph D Again, we should read the first lines which provide us with the main idea. “However, the major problems of the travel and tourism industry that have hidden, or obscured, its economic impact are the diversity and fragmentation of the industry itself “. It means it has become difficult to recognise (hidden/obscured) the economic impacts of tourism. So, the answer is: v (Difficulty in recognising the economic effects of tourism) Question 4: Paragraph E Read lines 3-5 where the author says, “…. .. . . suggests that tourism has become the largest commodity in international trade for many nations and, for a significant number of other countries, it ranks second or third.” Then, he shows some examples. So, the lines show the impact of tourism worldwide. So, the answer is: vii (The world impact of tourism) Questions 5-10: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 5: The largest employment figures in the world are found in the travel and tourism industry. Keywords for the question: largest employment figures, travel and tourism industry For this question, we have to look at figures of employment. So, we need to find out words like ‘employment’, ‘employee’, ‘employer’ etc. In paragraph C, the author says in lines 9-10, “The travel and tourism industry is the world’s largest employer with almost 130 million jobs, or almost 7 percent of all employees.” So, the answer is: TRUE Question 6: Tourism contributes over six per cent of the Australian gross national product. Keywords for the question: tourism, over six per cent, Australian, gross, national, product There is no mention of Australian gross national product or Australia in the passage. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 7: Tourism has a social impact because it promotes recreation. Keywords for the question: tourism, social impact, promotes recreation We can find the mention of ‘social impact’ of tourism in paragraph C. However, the paragraph has no clue about whether or not tourism has social impact because of its promotion of recreation. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 8: Two main features of the travel and tourism industry make its economic significance difficult to ascertain. Keywords for the question: two main features, economic significance, difficult to ascertain Look closely at paragraph D. The first lines say, “However, the major problems of the travel and tourism industry that have hidden, or obscured, its economic impact are the diversity and fragmentation of the industry itself.” The lines mean that two main features of travel and tourism industry (diversity and fragmentation) have hidden, or obscured (make difficult to ascertain) its economic significance. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 9: Visitor spending is always greater than the spending of residents in tourist areas. Keywords for this question: visitor spending, greater, resident spending We find a mention of ‘spending by visitors’ in line 7 of paragraph D. However, this paragraph does not give us any specific information about any comparison on visitor spending and resident spending. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 10: It is easy to show statistically how tourism affects individual economies. Keywords for this question: easy to show, statistically, tourism affect economies. In paragraph E, take a look at the last of the paragraph. “However, because of problems of definition, which directly affect statistical measurement, it is not possible with any degree of certainty to provide precise, valid or reliable data about the extent of world-wide tourism participation or its economic impact.” The lines mean it is not so easy (it is not possible with any degree of certainty) to present statistically (statistical measurement) the impact of tourism. So, the answer is: FALSE Questions 11-13 :(Completing sentences with NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to write no more than three words to complete sentences on the given topic. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word/words.] Question 11: In Greece, tourism is the most important ___________. Keywords for this question: Greece, most important We find the mention of Greece in the last paragraph (paragraph E), lines 5-6: “For example, tourism is the major source of income in Bermuda, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and most Caribbean countries.” Here, major means most important. So, the answer is: source of income Question 12: The travel and tourism industry in Jamaica is the major ___________. Keywords for this question: Jamaica, the major In paragraph E, look at lines 8-10, where the author says, “…… suggest that the travel and tourism industry is the number one ranked employer in the Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, France, (the former) West Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States.” Here, number one ranked means major. So, the answer is: employer Question 13: The problems associated with measuring international tourism are often reflected in the measurement of __________. Keywords for this question: problems, measuring international tourism, often reflected, measurement, Have a look at the last lines of paragraph E, “However, because of problems of definition, which directly affect statistical measurement, it is not possible with any degree of certainty to provide precise, valid or reliable data about the extent of world-wide tourism participation or its economic impact. In many cases, similar difficulties arise when attempts are made to measure domestic tourism.” Here, similar difficulties arise means reflected. So, the answer is: domestic tourism Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Autumn Leaves Questions 14-18 (Identifying information): [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. For this passage, first answer question 4- 13. After finishing with these questions, come to question 1-3. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 14: a description of the substance responsible for the red colouration of leaves. Keywords for this question: substance, responsible, red colouration, leaves For this question we need to find the clue (the substance) which causes the leaves to turn red. Take a look at the first lines of paragraph C. The writer says, “The source of the red is widely known: it is created by anthocyanins, water-soulable plant pigments reflecting the red to blue range of the visible spectrum.” This means the substance which is responsible for red colouration of leaves is anthocyanins. So, the answer is: C Question 15: the reason why trees drop their leaves in the autumn. Keywords for this question: reason, trees drop, leaves, autumn In paragraph B lines 3-7 say, “As fall approaches in the northern hemisphere, the amount of solar energy available declines considerably. For many trees – evergreen conifers being an exception – the best strategy is to abandon photosynthesis until the spring. So rather than maintaining the now redundant leaves throughout the winter, the tree saves its precious resources and discards them.” So, the lines suggest that many trees like the conifers cannot create photosynthesis due to the lack of solar energy. So, they stop their photosynthesis until spring. The tree drops the leaves to save its precious energy. Here, discards = drops So, the answer is: B Question 16: some evidence to confirm a theory about the purpose of the red leaves Keywords for this question: evidence, confirm, theory, purpose, red leaves. In paragraph H the writer starts by saying, “Even if you had never suspected that this is what was going on when leaves turn red, there are clues out there.” The lines suggest that there are some clues or evidences which can confirm the purpose of red leaves. Then, in the following lines the writer shows three evidences to confirm the theory. So, the answer is: H Question 17: an explanation of the function of chlorophyll Keywords for this question: function, chlorophyll In paragraph B, the author says in the very first lines, “Summer leaves are green because they are full of chlorophyll, the molecule that captures sunlight and converts that energy into new building materials for the tree.” So, this line explains what chlorophyll does. So, the answer is: B Question 18: a suggestion that the red colouration in leaves could serve as a warning signal Keywords for this question: red colouration, could serve as, warning signal In paragraph E the first lines talk about a suggestion, “It has also been proposed that trees may produce vivid red colours to convince herbivorous insects that they are healthy and robust and would be easily able to mount chemical defenses against infestation.” So, this proposal means that the red colouration works as a warning sign for herbivorous insects and protect the trees from those insects. So, the answer is: E Questions 19-22 (Completing sentences with NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to write no more than three words to complete sentences on the given topic. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word/words.] Question 19: The most vividly coloured red leaves are found on the side of the tree facing the _________. Keywords for this question: most vividly coloured red leaves, found, side, facing In paragraph H lines 2-3, the writer says,“One is straightforward: on many trees, the leaves that are the reddest are those on the side of the tree which gets most sun.” Here, the leaves that are the reddest = most vividly coloured red leaves, get = faces So, the answer is: sun Question 20: The __________ surfaces of leaves contain the most red pigment. Keywords for this question: surface, contains, most red pigment Take a look at lines 3-4 in paragraph H, where the writer says, “Not only that, but the red is brighter on the upper side of the leaf.” Here, the lines mean that the red colour/ pigment is found most (the red is brighter) on the upper side (surface). So, the answer is: upper Question 21: Red leaves are most abundant when daytime weather conditions are ________ and sunny. Keywords for this question: most abundant, daytime weather, sunny Again, in paragraph H, the writer mentions in lines 4-5, “It has also been recognised for decades that the best conditions for intense red colours are dry, sunny days and . . … . . ” The lines suggest that ‘intense red colour’ (Red leaves are most abundant) when the daytime weather is dry and sunny. So, the answer is: dry Question 22: The intensity of the red colour of leaves increases as you go further __________. Keywords for this question: intensity of red colour, increases, go further In paragraph H lines 7-8, the writer says, “And finally, trees such as maples usually get much redder the more north you travel in the northern hemisphere.” Here, the lines mean if you travel further north, you will see much redder leaves / the intensity of red colour will increase. So, the answer is: north Question 23-25: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 23: It is likely that the red pigments help to protect the leaf from freezing temperatures. Keywords for this answer: red pigments, protect, freezing temperatures In paragraph D, the writer talks about the possibility of the defense mechanism of red pigments in the very first sentence, “Some theories about anthocyanins have argued that they might act as a chemical defense against attacks by insects or fungi, or that they might attract fruit-eating birds or increase a leafs tolerance to freezing.” The statement suggests that red pigment actually increases leaf’s tolerance to freezing, not protect the leaf from freezing temperature. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 24: The ‘light screen’ hypothesis would initially seem to contradict what is known about chlorophyll. Keywords for this answer: light screen hypothesis, seem to contradict, about chlorophyll In paragraph F, the author mentions in lines 1-3, “Perhaps the most plausible suggestion as to why leaves would go to the trouble of making anthocyanins when they’re busy packing up for the winter is the theory known as the ‘light screen’ hypothesis. It sounds paradoxical, … …” Here, paradoxical = seems to contradict So, the answer is: TRUE Question 25: Leaves which turn colours other than red are more likely to be damaged by sunlight. Keywords for this answer: turn colours other than red, more likely, damaged, sunlight In paragraph I we find the writer’s confused tone over the issue of colouration of leaves by some trees and not by some others. “…. .. is why some trees resort to producing red pigments while others don’t bother, and simply reveal their orange or yellow hues. Do these trees have other means at their disposal to prevent overexposure to light in autumn? … .. ..” There is no clue or a clear decision regarding this. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 26: Multiple choice question For which of the following questions does the writer offer an explanation? A why conifers remain green in winter B how leaves turn orange and yellow in autumn C how herbivorous insects choose which trees to lay their eggs in D why anthocyanins are restricted to certain trees In paragraph B we find a clear explanation about how leaves turn orange and yellow in autumn. The writer concludes the paragraph by saying, “.. ..This unmasking explains the autumn colours of yellow and orange. .. . . .. . …” So, the answer is: B Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: Beyond the blue horizon Questions 27-31 (Summary completion using list of words) (In this kind of questions candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. As these are Fill in the blanks or gaps, there is a condition of writing the words from given list of words for each answer. The words are given with letters and candidates must fill in the blanks with the correct letter, not the word/words. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps.) The title of the summary: The Efate burial site Question 27 and 28: A 3,000-year-old burial ground of a seafaring people called the Lapita has been found on an abandoned 27 _________ on the Pacific island of Efate. The cemetery, which is a significant 28 _______, was uncovered accidentally by an agricultural worker. Question 27: Keywords for this question: 3000 years old burial ground, Lapita, abandoned, The answer is found in lines 5-9, where the author mentions the discovery of a 3000-year-old burial site. “… .. . An agricultural worker, digging in the grounds of a derelict plantation, scraped open a grave – the first of dozens in a burial ground some 3,000 years old.” Here, the word ‘derelict’ means ‘abandoned’. So, the answer is: B (plantation) Question 28: Keywords for this question: cemetery, significant, IMPORTANT TIPS: Generally all the answers in ‘fill in the blanks’ type of questions maintain sequence. In this question, however, the answer is found way before question no. 1. This can happen in Reading Passage 3 and candidates need to be aware of this. So, we need to look for keywords which match the keyword ‘significant’. The very first line says, “An important archaeological discovery on the island of Efate in the Pacific archipelago of Vanuatu has revealed traces . .. . .” And then, in the next few lines we find the mention of the discovery of the cemetery (burial ground) by an agricultural worker. So, the answer is: F (archaeological discovery) Questions 29: The Lapita explored and colonised many Pacific islands over several centuries. They took many things with them on their voyages including __________ and tools. Keywords for this question: The Lapita, voyages, tools, We find about the voyages made by the Lapita in the following paragraph. Lines 1-6 of paragraph no. 2 say, “They were daring blue-water adventurers (voyagers) who used basic canoes to rove across the ocean. But they were not just explorers. They were also pioneers who carried with them everything they would need to build new lives – their livestock, taro seedlings and stone tools.”. Here, the line inform us of the Lapita taking some important things with them on their voyages or sea/ ocean journeys; livestock, taro seedlings and stone tools. The word ‘livestock’ means ‘animals’, ‘taro seedlings’ mean saplings of some sort of root-type plants and stone tools mean tools made of stone. The word ‘tools’ is mentioned at the end of the question. Therefore, our answer should be either ‘livestock/animals’ or ‘taro seedlings’. In the options given with question, we do not find any synonyms for ‘taro seedlings’. So, the answer is: I (animals) the word is synonymous to ‘livestock’. Question 30 and 31: The burial ground increases the amount of information about the Lapita available to scientists. A team of researchers, led by Matthew Spriggs from the Australian National University, are helping with the excavation of the site. Spriggs believes the 30 _______ which was found at the site is very important since it confirms that the 31 ________ found inside are Lapita. Keywords for these questions: team of researchers, Matthew Spriggs, very important, confirms, found inside Here, we need to look for thoughts/comments/remarks made by researcher Matthew Spriggs about a discovered material and its importance. Look at lines 6-11 in paragraph no. 3. “Other items included a Lapita burial urn with modeled birds arranged on the rim as though peering down at the human remains sealed inside. . .. . “It’s an important discovery,” says Matthew Spriggs, … . .. .‟ for it conclusively identifies the remains as Lapita. Here, the lines mean that the team of researchers led by Matthew Spriggs, professor of archaeology at the Australian National University, says that the burial urn found in the discovery is important because it carried human remains inside which proved to the remains of Lapita people. Human remains = bones So, the answers are: G (burial urn) D (bones) Questions 32-35 (Multiple choice questions) [‘Multiple choice questions’ is a common type of question set in IELTS Reading test. It is also found in Listening test. Most of the time, they come with four options but sometimes there are three options. Candidates need to work hard for this type of questions because this may confuse them easily in passage 2 or passage 3. There will be long answers for each question, so they may kill valuable time. So, quick reading or skimming technique might come handy here. Remember that answers in 3 options out of 4 will be very close. So, vocabulary power will help a lot to choose the best answer. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question 32: According to the writer, there are difficulties explaining how the Lapita accomplished their journeys because – Keywords for this question: difficulties, explaining, Lapita, accomplished, journeys, because, In paragraph no. 5, the author mentions, “There is one stubborn question for which archaeology has yet to provide any answers: how did the Lapita accomplish the ancient equivalent of a moon landing, many times over? No-one has found one of their canoes or any rigging, which could reveal how the canoes were sailed. Nor do the oral histories and traditions of later Polynesians offer any insights, for they turn into myths long before they reach as far back in time as the Lapita.” The lines indicate to the fact that archaeology of the present time could not verify all the information relating to their accomplishments made by Lapita so long ago. Even local Polynesians could not provide any insight regarding this matter. So, the answer is: C (Little information relating to this period can be relied upon for accuracy) Question 33: According to the sixth paragraph, what was extraordinary about the Lapita? Keywords for this question: sixth paragraph, extraordinary about, Lapita, In lines 9-14 of paragraph no. 6, the writer states, “The real adventure didn’t begin, however, until their Lapita descendants sailed out of sight of land, with empty horizons on every side. This must have been as difficult for them as landing on the moon for us today.” The lines suggest that the voyages / sailing out of sight of land (beyond the point where land was visible) were really extraordinary for the Lapita as it is compared to landing on the moon. So, the answer is: A (They sailed beyond the point where land was visible) Question 34: What does ‘This’ refer to in the seventh paragraph? Keywords for this question: ‘This’, seventh paragraph, The answer is in paragraph 7. Here, the writer mentions the comments of Professor Geoff Irwin, “They could sail out for days into the unknown and assess the area, secure in the knowledge that if they didn’t find anything, they could turn about and catch a swift ride back on the trade winds. This is what would have made the whole thing work.” So, in this context, the word ‘this’ indicates to the Lapita people’s belief that if they failed to find anything in the open, wide ocean and they could turn back, the trade winds would guide them and bring them back home swiftly. So, the answer is: D (the Lapita’s belief they would be able to return home) Question 35: According to the eighth paragraph, how was the geography of the region significant? Keywords for this question: eighth paragraph, how, geography, significant The answer is both at the beginning and at the end of paragraph no. 8. In the beginning, the writer says, “For returning explorers, successful or not, the geography of their own archipelagoes would have provided a safety net. Without this to go by, overshooting their home ports, getting lost and sailing off into eternity would have been all too easy.” This means that the geography of the area gave them safety from getting lost in the open ocean. Then at the end of the paragraph, “.. . . ..its scores of intervisible islands forming a backstop for mariners riding the trade winds home.” This line suggests that the mariners used the intervisible islands (islands which can be seen from one island to another) to use trade wind accurately to return home, which means the navigation on returning home was made easy by the geography of the area. So, the answer is: C (It provided a navigational aid for the Lapita) Questions 36-40 (YES/NO/NOT GIVEN): In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer. Question 36: It is now clear that the Lapita could sail into a prevailing wind. Keywords for this question: now clear, sail into, prevailing wind The answer can be found in paragraph no. 9. Here, the writer mentions the remarks of Professor Atholl Anderson. Look carefully, “All this presupposes one essential detail, says Atholl Anderson, professor of prehistory at the Australian National University: the Lapita had mastered the advanced art of sailing against the wind. ‘And there’s no proof they could do any such thing.’ Anderson says.” So, the answer is: NO Question 37: Extreme climate conditions may have played a role in Lapita migration. Keywords for this question: extreme climate conditions, Lapita migration Take a look at paragraph no. 10, where the writer mentions El Nino. “Rather than give all the credit to human skill, Anderson invokes the winds of chance. El Nino, the same climate disruption that affects the Pacific today, may have helped scatter the Lapita,. …” Here, Professor Anderson is suggesting the climate disruption (extreme climate condition) named El Nino played a significant role to scatter the Lapita (Lapita migration). So, the answer is: YES Question 38: The Lapita learnt to predict the duration of El Ninos. Keywords for this question: predict, duration, El Ninos, We find the mention of El Nino only in paragraph no. 10. However, there is no information regarding the Lapita people learned to predict about the duration of El Nino. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 39: It remains unclear why the Lapita halted their expansion across the Pacific. Keywords for this question: unclear, halted expansion, the Pacific, Paragraph no. 11 starts with this line, “However they did it, the Lapita spread themselves a third of the way across the Pacific, then called it quits for reasons known only to them.” Here, However they did it = It is unclear to us/ the writer, quits for reasons known only to them = only the Lapita knew about the halt (quit) of their expansion Therefore, the expansion halted by the Lapita for reasons known only to them. So, the answer is: YES Question 40: It is likely that the majority of Lapita settled on Fiji. Keywords for this question: the majority, Fiji, The last paragraph mentions about Fiji but it doesn’t mention about the number of population settled in Fiji. It only says, “They probably never numbered more than a few thousand in total, . ..” And at the last of the paragraph the number of islands in Fiji is mentioned. “. .. . they encountered hundreds of islands – more than 300 in Fiji alone.” So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN",

      "content_clean": "Reading Passage 1: The headline of the passage: The megafires of California Questions 1-6: (Completing notes with ONE WORD AND/OR A NUMBER): In this type of question, candidates are asked to write only word and/or a number to complete some notes on the given topic. For this type of question, first skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. [TIPS: Here scanning technique will come handy. Target the keywords of the questions to find the answers. Remember to focus on Proper nouns, random Capital letters, numbers, special characters of text etc.] Questions 1 and 2: Characteristics of wildfires and wildfire conditions today compared to the past: – Occurrence: more frequent – Temperature: hotter – Speed: faster – Movement: 1 ____________ more unpredictably – Size of fires: 2 ____________ greater on average than two decades ago. Question 1: Movement: ____________ more unpredictably Keywords for the question: movement, more unpredictably Read the last lines of paragraph no. 1. “The wildfires themselves, experts say, are generally hotter, faster, and spread more erratically than in the past.” Here, erratically means unpredictably. So, the answer is: spread Question 2: Size of fires: ____________ greater on average than two decades ago. Keywords for the question: size of fire, greater, than two decades ago The first lines of paragraph no. 2 give us the answer. ““Megafires, also called ‘siege fires’ are the increasingly frequent blazes that burn 50,000 acres or more – 10 times the size of the average forest fire of 20 years ago. Here, 20 years ago means two decades ago. So, the answer is: 10/ten times Questions 3-6: Reasons wildfires cause more damage today compared to the past: – Rainfall: 3 _________ average – More brush to act as 4 __________ – Increase in yearly temperature – Extended fire 5 __________ – More building of 6 __________ in vulnerable places Question 3: Rainfall: _________ average Keywords for the question: rainfall, average We can find the keyword ‘rainfall’ in paragraph no. 3 but the word is not given there directly. We can see a synonym of ‘rainfall’ in line no. 4. Let’s read lines 1-4 of paragraph no. 3. “One explanation for the trend to more superhot fires is that the region, which usually has dry summers, has had significantly below normal precipitation in many recent years.” Here, the words ‘precipitation’ means ‘rainfall’, ‘normal’ means ‘average’. So, the answer is: below Question 4: More brush to act as __________ Keywords for the question: more brush, act as, Read lines 9-11 of paragraph no. 3, where the author says, “The unintentional consequence has been to halt the natural eradication of underbrush, now the primary fuel for megafires.” These lines mean that previously US Forest Service had a policy to cut down (eradication) the underbrush regularly because it was the main reason (primary fuel) for forest fires. But now the service is at halt (stop). So, more underbrush is growing more and more and it is acting as the fuel for megafires. So, the answer is: fuel Question 5: Extended fire __________ Keywords for the question: extended fire In paragraph no. 4 the author mentions three other factors of megafires. Take a look at the second factor in lines 5-7, “. .. . Second is fire seasons that on average are 78 days longer than they were 20 years ago.” Here, 78 days longer than they were 20 years ago = extended So, the answer is: seasons Question 6: More building of __________ in vulnerable places Keywords for the question: more building, vulnerable places, Again, in paragraph no. 4 the author mentions three other factors of megafires. Take a look at the third factor in lines 7-9, “Third is increased construction of homes in wooded areas.” As we know, wood is vulnerable/ risky for catching fire, here wooded areas means vulnerable places. Also, increased construction means more building. So, the answer is: homes Questions 7-13: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 7: The amount of open space in California has diminished over the last ten years. Keywords for the question: amount of open space, California, diminished, last ten years Lines 1-7 of paragraph no. 6 give the answer. “In California, where population growth has averaged more than 600,000 a year for at least a decade, more residential housing is being built. What once was open space is now residential homes providing fuels to make fires. .. . .” The lines suggest that California has a big population growth (600,000 every ten years/decade) and more residential houses has been built. So, open spaces have been occupied by residential homes which mean the amount of open space has diminished (decreased). So, the answer is: TRUE Question 8: Many experts believe California has made little progress in readying itself to fight fires. Keywords for the question: many experts, California, little progress, fight fires, In the beginning of paragraph 7, the writer mentions, “That said, many experts give California high marks for making progress on preparedness in recent years, after some of the largest fires in state history scorched thousands of acres, burned thousands of homes, and killed numerous people.” The lines suggest that experts believe that California should be given high marks or praised for the progress in preparedness in firefighting. So, the question contradicts with the information in the passage. Here, the phrase ‘readying itself’ means ‘preparedness’. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 9: Personnel in the past have been criticised for mishandling fire containment. Keywords for the question: personnel, criticised, mishandling, fire containment, In the final half part of paragraph 7, the author talks about the criticism, “Stung in the past by criticism of bungling that allowed fires to spread when they might have been contained, personnel are meeting the peculiar challenges of neighborhood – and canyon – hoping fires better than previously, observers say.” Here, stung in the past by criticism = criticised, bungling = mishandling, they might have been contained = fire containment, So, the answer is: TRUE Question 10: California has replaced a range of firefighting tools. Keywords for this question: replaced, firefighting tools, In paragraph 9, the writer starts by saying, “Besides providing money to upgrade the fire engines that must traverse the mammoth state and wind along serpentine canyon roads, the state has invested .. .. .” These lines suggest to the fact that the State of California has invested money to upgrade (replace) its firefighting engines or tools. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 11: More firefighters have been hired to improve fire-fighting capacity. Keywords for this question: more firefighters, hired, improve, fire-fighting capacity, In this passage, we find the writer mentioning the upgrading of firefighting engines or tools, but there is no mention of whether more firefighters have been hired to improve fire-fighting capacity. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 12: Citizens and government groups disapprove of the efforts of different states and agencies working together. Keywords for this question: citizens and government groups, disapprove, states and agencies, working together, Take a look the end of paragraph 9, where the writer states, “There is a sense among both government and residents that the speed, dedication, and coordination of firefighters from several states and jurisdictions are resulting in greater efficiency than in past ‘siege fire’ situations.” The lines clearly suggest that both citizens (residents) and government groups approve or support the efforts of different states and agencies (jurisdictions) working together (coordination). So, the statement in the passage contradicts with the question. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 13: Randy Jacobs believes that loss of life from fires will continue at the same levels, despite changes made. Keywords for this question: Randy Jacobs, loss of life, same levels, We find the comments of Randy Jacobs at the very end of the passage who says, “Notwithstanding all the damage that will continue to be caused by wildfires, we will no longer suffer the loss of life endured in the past because of the fire prevention and firefighting measures that have been put in place”. This means as a result of the fire prevention and firefighting measures, citizens of California will no longer suffer the loss of life from fires like they did in the past. So, the statement clearly contradicts with the given question. So, the answer is: FALSE Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Second Nature Questions 14-18 (Summary completion with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS) (In this kind of questions candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps. TIP: First skim to go to the paragraph(s) from where the questions have been set. Then scan for keywords to find the answer. Remember, the answers will follow a sequence. ) Question 14 and 15: Psychologists have traditionally believed that a personality 14 ___________ was impossible and that by a 15 _____________, a person’s character tends to be fixed. Keywords for this question: traditionally believed, personality, impossible, character, fixed In section A, paragraph no. 1, we find the view of psychologists at the very beginning. “Psychologists have long held that a person’s character cannot undergo a transformation in any meaningful way and that the key traits of personality are determined at a very young age.” Here, cannot undergo = was impossible, are determined = tends to be fixed, So, the answers are: transformation young age Question 16: One of the easiest qualities to acquire is ____________. Keywords for this question: easiest qualities, acquire, In section A paragraph no. 2, the writer starts by saying, “Some qualities are less challenging to develop than others, optimism being one of them.” Here, less challenging = easiest quality to acquire, So, the answer is: optimism Question 17 and 18: However, regardless of the quality, it is necessary to learn a wide variety of different 17 ___________ in order for a new quality to develop; for example, a person must understand and feel some 18 __________ in order to increase their happiness. Keywords for this question: learn, different, new quality to develop, understand and feel, increase, happiness, In section A paragraph no. 2, the writer says at the end, “However, developing qualities requires mastering a range of skills which are diverse and sometimes surprising. For example, to bring more joy and passion into your life, you must be open to experiencing negative emotions.” Here, developing qualities = a new quality to develop, a wide variety of = a range of, Increase their happiness = bring more joy and passion, must understand and feel = must be open to experience, So, the answers are: skills negative emotions Questions 19-22 (Matching statements with the correct persons) (In this type of question, candidates need to relate statements which are given by or links to some persons in the passage. The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the name of the person and read around it carefully. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same person in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions may not follow any sequential order.) Question 19: People must accept that they do not know much when first trying something new. Keywords for this question: must accept, not know much, new Take a look the end of paragraph F where you can find a statement made by Todd Kashdan, “As a newcomer, you also have to tolerate and laugh at your own ignorance. You must be willing to accept the negative feelings that come your way.” Here, as a newcomer means when first trying something new, tolerate means accept, ignorance means do not know much So, the answer is: E Question 20: It is important for people to actively notice when good things happen. Keywords for this question: important, actively notice, good things, happen The answer is found in paragraph D, in the recommendations made by Suzanne Segerstrom in lines 3-4, “She recommends you train yourself to pay attention to good fortune by writing down three positive things that come about each day.” Here, pay attention = actively notice, positive things = good things, come about = happen. So, the answer is: C Question 21: Courage can be learned once its origins in a sense of responsibility are understood. Keywords for this question: courage, be learned, origins, understood Take a look at lines 6-9 of paragraph H, the writer mentions here, “According to Cynthia Pury, a psychologist at Clemson University, Pedeleose’s story proves the point that courage is not motivated by fearlessness, but by moral obligation. Pury also believes that people can acquire courage.” Here, moral obligation = sense of responsibility So, the answer is: G Question 22: It is possible to overcome shyness when faced with the need to speak in public. Keywords for this question: overcome shyness, the need to speak in public, In paragraph B Christopher Peterson gives account of his own life experience, “Inherently introverted, he (Christopher Peterson) realised early on that as an academic, his reticence would prove disastrous in the lecture hall. So he learned to be more outgoing and entertain his classes. “Now my extroverted behaviour is spontaneous,” he says. …” Here, reticence = shyness, to be more outgoing and entertain his classes = speak in public, overcome shyness = learned to be more outgoing, So, the answer is: A Question 23-26: (Identifying information): [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. For this passage, first answer question 4- 13. After finishing with these questions, come to question 1-3. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 23: a mention of how rational thinking enabled someone to achieve physical goals. Keywords for this answer: rational thinking, achieve goals In paragraph E the writer mentions in lines 5-9, “The physical stamina required for this sport is intense but the psychological demands are even more overwhelming. Streeter learned to untangle her fears from her judgment of what her body and mind could do.” Here, judgment means rational thinking. So the last lines mean that Streeter had learned to untangle (recover from) her fears by rationally thinking or judging. So, the answer is: E Question 24: an account of how someone overcame a sad experience Keywords for this answer: overcame, sad experience Take a look at paragraph C where the writer says, “He (David Fajgenbaum) was preparing for university, when he had an accident that put an end to his sports career…He launched a support group to help others in similar situations. He took action despite his own pain – a typical response of an optimist.” Here, accident = sad experience, took action despite his own pain = overcame So, the answer is: C Question 25: a description of how someone decided to rethink their academic career path. Keywords for this answer: rethink, academic career path We can find the answer in paragraph G, “He (Mauro Zappaterra) was miserable as his research wasn’t compatible with his curiosity about healing. He finally took a break and during eight months in Santa Fe, Zappaterra learned about alternative healing techniques not taught at Harvard. When he got back, he switched labs to study how cerebrospinal fluid nourishes the developing nervous system.” Here, learned about alternative healing techniques . .. . and he switched labs to study. .. .. = rethink … academic career path So, the answer is: G Question 26: an example of how someone risked his career out of a sense of duty. Keywords for this answer: risked his career, duty The answer is found in paragraph H, in lines 3-8, “The new manager was intimidating staff so Pedeleose carefully recorded each instance of bullying and eventually took the evidence to a senior director, knowing his own job security would be threatened…. Pedeleose’s story proves the point that courage is not motivated by fearlessness, but by moral obligation.” Here, his own job security would be threatened = risked his career, a sense of duty=moral obligation So, the answer is: H Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: When evolution runs backwards Questions 27-31 (Multiple choice questions) [‘Multiple choice questions’ is a common type of question set in the IELTS Reading test. It is also found in the Listening test. Most of the time, they come with four options but sometimes there are three options. Candidates need to work hard for this type of question because this may confuse them easily in passage 2 or passage 3. There will be long answers for each question, so they may kill valuable time. So, quick reading or skimming techniques might come in handy here. Remember that answers in 3 options out of 4 will be very close. So, vocabulary power will help a lot to choose the best answer. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question 27: When discussing the theory developed by Louis Dollo, the writer says that – Keywords for this question: theory, Louis Dollo, We find the mention of Louis Dollo in paragraph no. 3. Here, in lines 2-13, the writer says, “… . ..a Belgian palaeontologist called Louis Dollo was studying fossil records and coming to the opposite conclusion. In 1890, he proposed that evolution was irreversible: that ‘an organism is unable to return, even partially, to a previous stage already realised in the ranks of its ancestors’. Early 20th-century biologists came to a similar conclusion, though they qualified it in terms of probability, stating that there is no reason why evolution cannot run backwards – it is just very unlikely.” Here, they qualified it in terms of probability = they (20th century biologists) modified the theory of Louis Dollo. So, the answer is: C (it was modified by biologists in the early twentieth century) Question 28: The humpback whale caught off Vancouver Island is mentioned because of – Keywords for this question: humpback whale, Vancouver Island In paragraph no. 4 we find the reference of the discovery of humpback whale., “In 1919, for example, a humpback whale with a pair of leg-like appendages over a metre long, complete with a set of limb bones, was caught off Vancouver Island in Canada. Explorer Roy Chapman Andrews argued at the time that the whale must be a throwback to a land-living ancestor.” This argument of Andrews is quite opposite to the theory presented by Dollo’s law. Therefore, we need to understand that the humpback whale is mentioned here because of its strange / unusual features. So, the answer is: D (the reason given for its unusual features) Question 29: What is said about ‘silent genes’? Keywords for this question: silent genes In paragraph no. 5, the last lines give us the answer, “They reasoned that while some evolutionary changes involve the loss of genes and are therefore irreversible, others may be the result of genes being switched off. If these silent genes are somehow switched back on, they argued, long-lost traits could reappear.” The lines mean that ‘silent genes’ could lead to the re-emergence of certain characteristics. Here, characteristics = traits and re-emerge = reappear So, the answer is: C (They could lead to re-emergence of certain characteristics) Question 30: The writer mentions the mole salamander because – Keywords for this question: mole salamander In paragraph no. 6, the writer mentions Rudolf Raff’s 10-million year time frame of the survival of silent genes. Then, we find the reference of mole salamander in paragraph no. 7. In the end of paragraph no. 7, the writer says, “The salamander example fits with Raff’s 10-million-year time frame.” Here, fits = matches This means that the example of mole salamander was given to prove that Raff’s theory was correct. So, the answer is: B (it suggests that Raff’s theory is correct) Question 31: Which of the following does Wagner claim? Keywords for this question: Wagner, claim, In paragraph no. 8, “According to his (Wagner’s) analysis of the Bachia family tree, the toed species re-evolved toes from toeless ancestors and, what is more, digit loss and gain has occurred on more than one occasion over tens of millions of years” So, the lines suggest Wagner claims that members of the Bachia lizard family have lost and regained certain features more the one time. Here, several times = on more than one occasion So, the answer is: A (Members of the Bachia lizard family have lost and regained certain features several times) Questions 32-36 (Matching sentence ending) [For this type of question, candidates need to match the beginning and ending of sentences. Candidates need to look for keywords in the sentence-beginnings and find the relative paragraphs and then sentences in the passage. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question 32: For a long time biologists rejected – Keywords for this question: long time, biologists, rejected, In paragraph no. 1, take a look at lines 3-6, “.. .. .. For the better part of a century, most biologists have been reluctant to use those words, mindful of a principle of evolution that says ‘evolution cannot run backwards’…”. Here, ‘those words’ indicate to the words in the previous lines ‘evolutionary throwback’. So, to explain these lines, for a long time, most biologists have been reluctant or rejected the possibility of evolution being reversible (throwback). So, the answer is: F (the possibility of evolution being reversible.) Question 33: Opposing views on evolutionary throwbacks are represented by – Keywords for this question: opposing views, evolutionary throwbacks, In lines 1-4 of paragraph no. 3, the writer states, “While Lombroso was measuring criminals; a Belgian palaeontologist called Louis Dollo was studying fossil records and coming to the opposite conclusion.” The lines suggest that Lombroso and Dollo were studying different fields but they were also studying the same theory whether evolution could reappear. But their conclusions or findings were opposing. So, the answer is: G (Dollo’s findings and the convictions held by Lombroso.) Note: here, convictions = beliefs or views Question 34: Examples of evolutionary throwbacks have led to – Keywords for this question: examples, evolutionary throwbacks, In the first few lines of paragraph no. 5, the author states, “Since then, so many other examples have been discovered that it no longer makes sense to say that evolution is as good as irreversible. And this poses a puzzle: how can characteristics that disappeared millions of years ago suddenly reappear?” This means the examples have led us to the puzzle or question about the reappearance of long-lost traits or characteristics. So, the answer is: A (the question of how certain long-lost traits could reappear.) Question 35: The shark and killer whale are mentioned to exemplify – Keywords for this question: shark, killer whale, In paragraph 9 the writer mentions, “One possibility is that these traits are lost and then simply reappear, in much the same way that similar structures can independently arise in unrelated species, such as the dorsal fins of sharks and killer whales.” These lines suggest that the shark and killer whale are mentioned to exemplify the occurrence of a particular feature in different or unrelated species. So, the answer is: B (the occurrence of a particular feature in different species.) Question 36: One explanation for the findings of Wagner’s research is – Keywords for this question: Wagner, research, In paragraph 9 the writer mentions, “Another more intriguing possibility is that the genetic information needed to make toes somehow survived for tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of years in the lizards and was reactivated.” This means an explanation of Wagner’s research is that the continuous existence (survived for tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of years) So, the answer is: D (the continued existence of certain genetic information.) Questions 37-40 (YES/NO/NOT GIVEN): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 37: Wagner was the first person to do research on South American lizards. Keywords for this question: Wagner, first, South American lizards Studying the passage we can learn that Wagner did research on South American research (paragraph no. 8). However, whether Wagner was the first person to such research is not mentioned anywhere in the passage. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 38: Wagner believes that Bachia lizards with toes had toeless ancestors. Keywords for this question: Bachia lizards with toes, toeless ancestors, Take a look at these lines in paragraph 8, “According to his analysis of the Bachia family tree, the toed species re-evolved toes from toeless ancestors…” These lines suggest that the statement is true. So, the answer is: YES Question 39: The temporary occurrence of long-lost traits in embryos is rare. Keywords for this question: temporary occurrence, long-lost traits, rare, In the last paragraph, the writer mentions in lines 4-5,“Early embryos of many species develop ancestral features.” These lines suggest that the temporary occurrence of long-lost traits (ancestral features) in embryos is not rare as it happens in many species. So, the answer is: NO Question 40: Evolutionary throwbacks might be caused by developmental problems in the womb. Keywords for this question: Evolutionary throwbacks, might be caused, developmental problems, womb, Again in the last paragraph, look at lines 1-4, “But if silent genes degrade within 6 to 10 million years, how can long-lost traits be reactivated over longer time scales? The answer may lie in the womb.” The lines suggest that we find answer to the question about evolutionary throwbacks if we look at research findings about the womb. So, the answer is: YES",

      "content_clean": "READING PASSAGE 1 So, let’s begin. Questions 1-7: Completing sentences by filling in the gaps (NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS) Indoor Farming Some food plants, including ­­­_______, are already grown indoors. Key phrase for the answer is already grown indoors The answer is found in the first sentence of Paragraph 2 where the author states, “The concept of indoor farming is not new, since hothouse production of tomatoes and other produce has been in vogue for some time”. The example of only tomatoes clarifies the answer for the question. In the question, the word including is synonymous to for example. More clues: in vogue for some time = already, hothouse production= grown indoors Answer: tomatoes Vertical farms would be located in _________, meaning that there would be less need to take them long distances to customers. Key words / phrases for the answer are: vertical farm, located, distances The answer is found in line 15 of Paragraph 2 where the author says, “Situated in the heart of urban centres, they (vertical farms) would drastically reduce the amount of transportation required to bring food to customers”. More clues: situated= located, transportation= distance, drastically reduce= would be less Answer: urban centers / centres Vertical farms could use methane from plants and animals to produce ________. Key words for the answer are methane, produce The answer is found in paragraph 4 where the word methane is mentioned. Therefore, we should focus on it. Here, line 15 says, “Although the system would consume energy, it would return energy to the grid via methane generation from composting non-edible parts of plants”. More clues: return = produced as a result Answer: energy The consumption of ______ would be cut because agricultural vehicles would be unnecessary. Key words for this answer are consumption, cut, vehicles The answer is found in lines 19, 20, 21 of Paragraph 4 where the writer states, “It would also dramatically reduce fossil fuel use, by cutting out the need for tractors, ploughs and shipping.” More clues: use = consumption, reduce = cut, tractors = vehicles Answer: fossil fuels The fact that vertical farms would need ______ light is a disadvantage. Key words for the answer are need, light and disadvantage The answer is found in the opening of Paragraph 5 where the writer states, “A major drawback of vertical farming, however, is that the plants would require artificial light”. So, here we find a description of light which is artificial. More clues: require = need, drawback = disadvantage Answer: artificial One form of vertical farming involves planting in ______ which are not fixed. Key words / phrases for this answer are one form, planting, not fixed. The answer is found in the opening of Paragraph 6 where the author mentions, “One variation on vertical farming that has been developed is to grow plants in stacked trays that move on rails”. More clues: One variation =One form, move on rails = not fixed Answer: (stacked) trays The most probable development is that food will be grown on ___ in towns and cities. Key phrases/ words for the answer are most probable, grown on, towns and cities The answer is found at the ending of the passage, the author mentions, “Most experts currently believe it is far more likely that we will simply use the space available on urban rooftops.” More clues: far more likely = most probable, urban = towns and cities Answer: (urban) rooftops Questions 8-13: True, False, Not Given (You have to write whether the statements Yes, No or there is no information in the passage about it.) Methods for predicting the Earth’s population have recently changed. Key phrase for the answer is have recently changed In the first paragraph, the author says, “applying the most conservative estimates to current demographic trends”. With this the author guesses the future population. However, there is no information about current / recent changes in population predicting methods. Therefore, we have to take the answer as NOT GIVEN. Answer: NOT GIVEN More clues: predict = estimate, demographic trends = population change Human beings are responsible for some of the destruction to food-producing land. Key words for the answer are responsible and destruction. In Paragraph 3, line 4 continues, “….. we despoiled most of the land we work, often turning verdant, natural eco-zones into semi-arid deserts”. It clearly tells us that human action is the reason of the injury to agricultural land. Human destroyed most of the crop-growing land, causing natural eco-zones to be turned into semi-arid deserts. So, the statement is TRUE. Answer: True More clues: natural areas of plants and animals = eco-zones, semi-arid = with low rate of water The crops produced in vertical farms will depend on the season. Key words for this answer are depend, seasons, produced At the outset of paragraph 2, the writer defines a benefit of vertical farming which is “sustainable production of a safe and varied food supply (through year-round production of all crops)”. In short, crops are produced in a controlled condition of environment and therefore not influenced by natural conditions. For this reason, the statement is FALSE. The production will not depend on the season. Answer: False Some damage to food crops is caused by climate change. Key phrase for this answer is climate change. The answer is in Paragraph 3 states, “However, more often than not now, due to a rapidly changing climate, this is not what happens. Massive floods, long droughts, hurricanes and severe monsoons take their toll each year, destroying millions of tons of valuable crops”. Therefore, because of climate change, unpleasant natural disasters result in the damage of many valuable crops. For this, the statement is TRUE. More clues: plants which are grown for food = crops Answer: True Fertilisers will be needed for certain crops in vertical farms. Key phrase for this answer is fertilisers needed The answer is located in the center of paragraph 4 where the writer states, “All the food could be grown organically, eliminating the need for herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers”. It is clear that there is zero need for fertilisers to grow crops in vertical farms. The statement opposes the information in the passage and so the statement is FALSE. Answer: False Vertical farming will make plants less likely to be affected by infectious diseases. Key word / phrase for this answer are less, infectious diseases The answer lies in paragraph 4 where the writer says, “The system would greatly reduce the incidence of many infectious diseases that are acquired at the agricultural interface”. The method (vertical farming) would decrease infectious diseases, which makes plants less likely to be affected. So, the statement is TRUE. Answer: True READING PASSAGE 2 Title of the passage: The Falkirk Wheel (A unique engineering achievement) Questions 14-19 (TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN] The Falkirk wheel has linked the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal for the first time in history. Keywords for this question: linked, Forth and Clyde Canal, Union Canal, first time, In paragraph 2 lines 4-9 say, “….Historically, the two canals had been joined near the town of Falkirk by a sequence of 11 locks – enclosed sections of canal in which the water level could be raised or lowered- that stepped down across a distance of 1.5 km. This has been dismantled in 1933, .. … .” These lines mean that both the canals had been linked before, so this is not the first time. So, the answer is: FALSE There was some opposition to the design of the Falkirk Wheel at first. Keywords for this question: opposition, design, at first As the most important keyword for this question is ‘opposition’, we need to find any word that relates to opposition. Apparently, there is no such information in the text. According to paragraph 3, many ideas were submitted for the project but the writer does not show whether anyone opposed the plan that was approved. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN The Falkirk Wheel was initially put together at the location where its components were manufactured. Keywords for this question: initially, put together, location, components, manufactured As this question asks for the location of the wheel, we need to find the information about the Wheel’s location. According to paragraph 4, lines 1-4, “The various parts of the Falkirk Wheel were all constructed and assembled at Butterley Engineering’s Steelworks in Derbyshire…”. So the statement and the information in the text have the same meaning. So, the answer is: TRUE The Falkirk Wheel is the only boat lift in the world which has steel sections bolted together by hand. Keywords for this question: only boat lift, bolted together by hand At the end of paragraph 4, the writer says, “Over 45,000 bolt holes were matched with their bolts, and each bolt was hand-tightened.” So, the writer does mention about bolts being hand-tightened. But, we do not find any information which confirms that it was the only boat with such unique feature. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN The weight of the gondolas varies according to the size of boat being carried. Keywords for this question: weight, varies, size of boat The answer can be found in paragraph 5 lines 6-7. Here, the writer says, “….These gondolas always weigh the same, whether or not they are carrying boats.” It means that the weight is always the same. So, the answer is: FALSE The construction of the Falkirk Wheel site took into account the presence of a nearby ancient monument. Keywords for this question: construction, presence, ancient, monument In relation to the last paragraph, “the Wheel could not be constructed to elevate boats over the full 35-metre difference between the two canals, owing to the presence of historically important Antonine Wall”. Here, historically important means ancient. So, we can understand form here that the construction of the Wheel is influenced by the presence of an ancient monument. So, the answer is: TRUE Questions 20-26 (Labeling diagram) [In this type of question, candidates will be asked to work on a picture and fill in some gaps in the given points or labels. There is a condition to write the answers with no more than one, two or three words. An interesting point about this type of question is that the answers for these questions are generally found around one or two paragraphs. The picture or diagram can become useful because it may help a lot to find critical information.] Title of the diagram: How a boat is lifted on the Falkirk Wheel A pair of ______ are lifted in order to shut out water from canal basin. Keywords for this question: a pair, lifted, shut out water In lines 4-7 of paragraph 6, we can find, “Two hydraulic steel gates are raised, so as to seal the gondola off from the water in the canal basin”. Now, here we find some matches with keywords. * a pair of = two * lifted = raised * shut out water = seal off from water So, the answer is: gates A _______ is taken out, enabling Wheel to rotate Keywords for this question: taken out, rotate As said in the fourth sentence of paragraph 6, “A hydraulic clamp ______ , is removed, allowing the Wheel to turn”. We find some matches with keywords here. *taken out = removed *rotate = turn So, the answer is: clamp Hydraulic motors drive_______ Keywords for this question: drive As far as paragraph 6 is concerned, “In the central machine room an array of ten hydraulic motors then begins to rotate the central axle“. So it means that the hydraulic motors drive, or control the axle by rotating it. So, the answer is: axle A range of different-sized ________ ensures boat keeps upright. Keywords for this question: different-sized, upright Again in paragraph 6, lines 16-21 say, “As the wheel rotates, the gondolas are kept in the upright position by a simple gearing system. Two eight-metre-wide cogs orbit a fixed inner cog of the same width connected by two smaller cogs…..” Here, the writer says that the writer illustrates the gearing system which comprises many cogs of different sizes. So, the word in the blank is cogs. So, the answer is: cogs Boat reaches top Wheel, then moves directly onto… Keywords for this question: moves directly onto If we look closely at the end of paragraph 6, the author indicates, “When the gondola reaches the top, the boat passes straight onto the aqueduct situated 24 metres above the canal basin”. Here, *move onto=pass onto, * directly=straight So, the answer is: aqueduct Boat travels through tunnel beneath Roman __________ Keywords for this question: beneath, Roman The end of the text provides us the answer. Here, in the last lines of the last paragraph, the writer says, “Boats travel under this wall via a tunnel …..”. “This wall” indicates to the wall built by the Romans in the 2nd century AD. Also, here under means beneath. So, the answer is: wall ________ raise boat 11m to level of Union Canal. Keywords for this question: raise, reach The final paragraph begins with a special information. “The remaining 11 metres of lift needed to reach the Union Canal is achieved by a pair of locks“. So, here it means that the locks actually lifts or raises boat. So, the answer is: locks READING PASSAGE 3 Title of the passage: Reducing the Effects of Climate Change Questions 27-29 (Identifying Information): [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. For this passage, first answer question 4- 13. After finishing with these questions, come to question 1-3. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] mention of a geo-engineering project based on an earlier natural phenomenon. Keywords for this question: geo-engineering, earlier natural phenomenon Here, the question asks us to find whether a geo-engineering project had been modelled on any natural phenomenon. We can skim the paragraphs one by one and in paragraph D, we find the mention of a natural phenomenon or disaster in lines 3-4, where it states, “The idea is modelled on historic volcanic explosions, such as that of Mount Pinatubo…… . .” So, the answer is: D an example of a successful use of geo-engineering. Keywords for this question: successful use, geo-engineering In paragraph B lines 1-2 say, “Geo-engineering has been shown to work, at least on a small localized scale. For decades, May Day parades in Moscow have taken place under clear blue skies, aircraft having deposited dry ice, silver iodide and cement powder to disperse cloud.’’ We can easily find here the example of a successful use of geo-engineering. So, the answer is: B a common definition of geo-engineering Keywords for this question: common, definition Generally, a definition of anything can be found in the first few paragraphs. So, we need to look carefully in Paragraph A. In paragraph A lines 7-8 state, “…. … . .geo-engineering – a term which generally refers to the intentional large-scale manipulation of the environment.” Here, refers to = means / defines So, the answer is: A Questions 30-36 (Completing table) [Here, the candidates are given a table with two portions where there are some blanks. Candidates must fill up these blanks with ONE WORD only. Finding keywords quickly can help here a lot.] to create a _________ that would reduce the amount of light reaching Earth. Keywords for this question: create, would reduce, light reaching earth Look carefully through the first few paragraphs and try to find out the word ‘spacecraft’ because this word is found in the Procedure column in the question. The mention of the word ‘spacecraft’ can be found in paragraph B, line 6. So, we have to scan from here. Lines 6-8 say, “…. His scheme would employ up to 16 trillion minute spacecraft, each weighing about one gram, to form a transparent, sunlight-refracting sunshade in an orbit 1.5 million km above the Earth. This could, argues Angel, reduce the amount of light reaching the Earth by two per cent.” Here, tiny = minute, create = form, far above Earth = 1.5 million km above the Earth So, the answer is: sunshade place………in the sea Keywords for this question: place, the sea In paragraph C, line 2 the writer says, “…. . . and depositing iron in the ocean to stimulate the growth of algae – …”. Here, depositing = place, ocean = the sea So, the answer is: iron to encourage ……..to form Keywords for this question: encourage, to form In paragraph C, line 2 the writer says, “…. . . and depositing iron in the ocean to stimulate the growth of algae – …”. Here, to stimulate the growth = encourage, to form So, the answer is: algae to create ……….that would reduce the amount of light reaching Earth. Keywords for this question: create, would reduce, light reaching Earth To find this question, we need to find out the paragraph that contains the information about aerosol sprays because ‘aerosol spray’ is mentioned in the Procedure column. The mention of ‘aerosol spray’ is found in paragraph D, line 1, and in line 3 it says, “… .. .. so that sulphur dioxide would form clouds which would, in turn, lead to a global dimming.” Here, create = form, reduce the amount of light reaching Earth = a global dimming, So, the answer is: clouds fix strong……to Greenland ice sheets Keywords for this question: fix, strong, Greenland ice sheets Just try to find the word ‘Greenland’ and you will get the answer. Focusing on paragraph D, we find the following lines – “Scientists have also scrutinized whether it’s possible to preserve the ice sheets of Greenland with reinforced high-tension cables, preventing icebergs from moving into the sea.” Here, strong = reinforced So, the answer is: cables to allow the……..to reflect radiation Keywords for this question: allow, reflect, radiation As said by the table, we have to find out information about planting trees in Russian Arctic, because at the end of paragraph D, the author says, “Meanwhile in the Russian Arctic, geo-engineering plans include the planting of millions of birch trees. Whereas the region’s native evergreen pines shade the snow and absorb radiation, birches would shed their leaves in winter, thus enabling radiation to be reflected by the snow.” So, planting trees would allow snow to reflect radiation. Here, lose = shed, allow = enable So, the answer is: snow change the direction of ……….. to bring more cold water into ice-forming areas. Keywords for this question: change, direction, to bring, more cold water, ice-forming areas For this question, the keyword is ice-forming areas. At the end of paragraph D, the author points out that “Re-routing Russian rivers to increase cold water flow to ice-forming areas could also be used to slow down warming, say some climate scientists.” Here, change the direction of = re-route, bring more cold water = increase cold water flow So, the answer is: rivers Questions 37-40 (Matching statements with list of people) [In this kind of questions, candidates are asked to match the given statements in the questions with the persons who gave those statements in the passage. To successfully answer these questions, you need to follow some simple steps: Step 1: Read the questions carefully and select the keywords, Step 2: Read the list of people, Step 3: Start reading from the beginning and quickly look for the names of people with any statement. Step 4: When you find a names with statements, read it attentively and match it with the questions. Step 5: Mark it properly so that you need not read it again. Then go to the next statement in the text. Step 6: Continue doing the same for the rest of the questions.] For these questions, we must focus on the last four paragraphs of Reading Passage 3 which contain the scientists’ statements. The effects of geo-engineering may not be long-lasting. Keywords for this question: effects, not long-lasting In paragraph E, there is a statement from Dr Phil Rasch which is as follows – “I think all of us agree that if we were to end geo-engineering on a given day, then the planet would return to its pre-engineered condition very rapidly… . . .. ” This means that once geo-engineering does its job, the effects of it on the planet may end, too. In other words, “the effects of geo-engineering may not be long-lasting” So, the answer is: B Geo-engineering is a topic worth exploring Keywords for this question: worth exploring In the last paragraph, Dr Martin Sommerkorn gives stress that “Human-induced climate change has brought humanity to a position where we shouldn’t exclude thinking thoroughly about this topic and its possibilities.” Here, we find some match: worth exploring = shouldn’t exclude thinking thoroughly So, the answer is: D It may be necessary to limit the effectiveness of geo-engineering projects. Keywords for this question: limit In paragraph G, we find a statement from Dan Lunt – “To avoid such a scenario, Lunt says Angel’s project would have to operate at half strength; all of which reinforces his view that the best option is to avoid the need for geo- engineering altogether.” Here, limit the effectiveness = operate at half strength So, the answer is: C Research into non-fossil-based fuels cannot be replaced by geo-engineering. Keywords for this question: non-fossil-based fuels The answer is in paragraph E, Angel says that his plan is “no substitute for developing renewable energy, the only ‘permanent solution’.” Here, non-fossil-based fuels = renewable energy, cannot be replaced = no substitute for So, the answer is: A",

Keywords for the question: some doubt, caused the Mary Rose to sink To find the answer to this question, we need to locate the keyword ‘some doubt’ which can be found in paragraph no. 1, lines 10-16. Here, the author writes, “Accounts of what happened to the ship vary: while witnesses agree that she was not hit by the French, some maintain that she was outdated, over-laden and sailing too low in the water, others that she was by undisciplined crew.” Here, Accounts ….. vary: means that the accounts on how the ship sank has some doubts. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 2: The Mary Rose was the only ship to sink in the battle of 19th July 1545. Keywords for the question: the only ship to sink, in the battle As we found information about the sinking of the Mary Rose in paragraph no. 1, we look for the answer to this question in the same paragraph. But we find no reference to whether Mary Rose was the only ship that sank in the battle because this paragraph and the following paragraphs only discusses about the Mary Rose. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 3: Most of one side of the Mary Rose lay undamaged under the sea. Keywords for the question: Most of one side, lay undamaged Paragraph no. 2 talks about the undamaged part of the Mary Rose. Look carefully at lines 10-11. The lines say, “Because of the way the ship sank, nearly all of the starboard half survived intact.” Here, nearly all of the starboard half matches with Most of one side, survived intact matches with lay undamaged` So, the answer is: TRUE Question 4: Alexander Mckee knew that the wreck would contain many valuable historical objects. Keywords for the question: Alexander Mckee, the wreck would contain, valuable historical objects We find the mention of Alexander Mckee in paragraph no. 4 and 5. However, paragraph no. 4 does not have any information about valuable historical objects. But take a close look at lines 5-9 of paragraph no. 5, “McKee and his team now knew for certain that they had found the wreck, but were as yet unaware that it also housed a treasure trove of beautifully preserved artefacts.” So, these lines indicate that Mckee and his team were not aware that the ship would have precious artefacts or valuable historical objects. So, the answer is: FALSE Questions 5-8 (Matching statements with the correct date/year) [In these questions, the candidates need to match statements with the correct dates or years. It is somewhat similar to Matching statements with Researchers/ Writers/ Persons. You need to scan the lines with dates or years to find the match with the statements. Remember that the answers may not follow a sequence or order.] Question 5: A search for the Mary Rose was launched. Keywords for the question: search, launched The first parts of paragraph no. 4 have the answer to this question. Here, in lines 1-5, the author states, “The Mary Rose then faded into obscurity for another hundred years. But in 1965, military historian and amateur diver Alexander McKee, in conjunction with the British Sub-Aqua Club, initiated a project called ‘Solent Ships’.” Here, initiated = launched. So, the answer is: C Question 6: One person’s exploration of the Mary Rose site stopped. Keywords for the question: exploration, stopped We can find the reference to Diver John Deane’s search in the Mary Rose in paragraph no. 3. Then in lines 13-14, the writer explains, “…. …Deane continued diving on the site intermittently until 1840, ….. . .. ” So, this means Deane stopped his exploration in 1840. So, the answer is: B Question 7: It was agreed that the hull of the Mary Rose should be raised. Keywords for the question: agreed, the hull, should be raised In paragraph no. 5, the author talks about the decision about raising the hull of the Mary Rose. In the last lines of the paragraph, the author writes, “While the original aim was to raise the hull if at all feasible, the operation was not given the go-ahead until January 1982, when all the necessary information was available.” So, the answer is: G Question 8: The site of the Mary Rose was found by chance. Keywords for the question: found by chance Answer to this question can be found in the first lines of paragraph no. 3. Here, the writer says, “Then, on 16 June 1836, some fishermen in the Solent found that their equipment was caught on an underwater obstruction, which turned out to be the Mary Rose.” So, the answer is: A Questions 9-13 (Labeling the diagram with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to write only one word/ no more than two words to label the diagram on the given topic. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word.] [TIPS: Here scanning technique will come in handy. Target the keywords of the questions to find the answers. Remember to focus on Proper nouns, random Capital letters, numbers, special characters of text etc.] Question 9: ________ attached to hull by wires Keywords for the question: attached, by wires In the last paragraph, the writer says in lines 6-7 “The hull was attached to a lifting frame via a network of bolts and lifting wires.” So, the answer is: lifting frame Question 10: ______ to prevent hull being sucked into mud Keywords for the question: prevent, sucked into mud The answer lies in lines 8-10 of the last paragraph where the writer says, “The problem of the hull being sucked back downwards into the mud was overcome by using 12 hydraulic jacks.” So, the answer is: hydraulic jacks Question 11: legs are placed into ________ Keywords for the question: legs, placed into We find the answer to this question in lines 22-24 of the last paragraph. The author says, “This required precise positioning to locate the legs into the ‘stabbing guides’ of the lifting cradle.” So, the answer is: stabbing guides Question 12: hull is lowered into _________ Keywords for the question: hull, lowered into The answer is found in lines 18-21 of the last paragraph. The author says, “In this stage, the lifting frame was fixed to a hook attached to a crane, and the hull was lifted completely clear of the seabed and transferred underwater into the lifting cradle.” Here, transferred underwater into = lowered into So the answer is: lifting cradle Question 13: _____ used as extra protection for the hull Keywords for the question: used as, extra protection The answer is found in lines 3-4 of the last paragraph, “The lifting cradle was designed to fit the hull using archaeological survey drawings, and was fitted with airbags to provide additional cushioning for the hull’s delicate timber framework.” Here, additional cushioning = extra protection So the answer is: airbags Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: What destroyed the civilization of Easter Island? Questions 14-20: (List of headings) [To find answers for List of Headings, check the first and (occasionally) the last few lines of each paragraph. Most of the time, the answer is there for you containing some synonymous words, which have a match with the lists of headings. If you cannot find the answers in the first and last few lines, you may need to check the middle of the paragraphs. This we did in other tests too.] Question 14: Paragraph A In paragraph A, the answer to this question is found at the end in lines 12-13 where the author mentions, “Modern science – linguistic, archeological, and genetic evidence – has definitely proved the moai builders were Polynesians, ……”. Here, the phrase definitely proved means that the fact has no dispute. So, the answer is: ii (An undisputed answer to a question about the moai) Question 15: Paragraph B In paragraph B lines 9-12, the author writes, “When the islanders (the Rapanui people) cleared the forests for firewood and farming, the forests didn’t grow back. As trees became scarce and they could no longer construct wooden canoes for fishing, they ate birds. Soil erosion decreased their crop yields.” All these indicate that the food resources actually decreased or diminished. So, the answer is: ix (Diminishing food resources) Question 16: Paragraph C The very first line of paragraph C has the answer. Here, the writer says, “The moai, he thinks, accelerated the self-destruction.” Then, the writer supports this idea and presented a list of what the moai (the statues) did, for example, competing by building ever bigger figures, laying the moai on wooden sledges, hauling over log rails, clearing land etc. So, the right answer for this paragraph has to be how the statues made the situation worse. So, the answer is: viii (How the statues made a situation worse) Question 17: Paragraph D In Paragraph D, the answer to this question can be traced simply looking at the last line. The author writes, “… .. . the prehistoric Rapanui were pioneers of sustainable farming.” So, this line indicates that the Rapanui people were the people to innovate some environmental friendly farming methods. The author supports it with previous lines, “.. .. . archaeological excavations indicate that the Rapanui went to heroic efforts to protect the resources of their wind-lashed, infertile fields. They built thousands of circular stone windbreaks and gardened inside them, and used broken volcanic rocks to keep the soil moist”. So, the answer is: i (Evidence of innovative environment management practices) Question 18: Paragraph E In Paragraph E, the answer is found in line no. 4. “.. .. Hunt and Lipo say, archeological evidence backs up Rapanui folklore… .. ” Here, backs up means support, folklore means local belief. So, the answer is: iv (A theory which supports a local belief) Question 19: Paragraph F In paragraph F, the author mentions a number of damages for which the Rapanui people were not responsible, for instance, rats and some deadly diseases. The first line gives the indication, “Moreover, Hunt and Lipo are convinced that the settler were not wholly responsible for the loss of the island’s trees. . . .” Then, in line 4, he talks about the rats, “.. .. The rats arrived along with the settlers… … .” and in lines 10-11 the writers mentions of the diseases, “.. .. of the Europeans, who introduced deadly diseases to which islanders had no immunity”. So, the answer is: vii (Destruction outside the inhabitants’ control) Question 20: Paragraph G In Paragraph G, the writer talks about two different views of the Rapanui. In one side, Hunt and Lipo provides the vision that the moai builders were “… peaceful and ingenious” (lines 1 2)., while we find another view that the Rapanui “were reckless destroyers ruining their own environment and society.” (lines 2 3). And the writer agrees with both vision in line 4. “Whichever is the case.. .. .” So, the correct heading for this paragraph has to be two opposing views about the Rapanui people. So, the answer is: vi (Two opposing views about the Rapanui people) Question 21-24 (Summary completion with ONE word only) (In this kind of questions candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. As these are fill in the blanks or gaps, there is a condition of writing ONE, TWO or THREE words for each answer. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps.) As the heading of the summary is Jared Diamond’s View, we have to start looking for answers from paragraph B. Question 21: Diamond believes that the Polynesian settlers on Rapa Nui destroyed its forests, cutting down its trees for fuel and clearing land for _________. Keywords for this question: destroyed forests, cutting down trees, for fuel, clearing land In paragraph B, the writer mentions in lines 5-9, “US scientist Jared Diamond believes that the Rapanui people – descendants of Polynesian settlers wrecked their own environment. They had unfortunately settled on an extremely fragile island – dry, cool, and too remote to be properly fertilised by windblown volcanic ash. When islanders cleared the forests for firewood and farming, the forests didn’t grow back.” It can be gathered from the lines that the islanders cleared the forests for two reasons, firewood (fuel) and farming. So, the answer is: farming Question 22: When the islanders were no longer able to build the _____ they needed to go fishing, …. .. Keywords for this question: no longer able to build, needed to go fishing The answer is in line 10 of paragraph B. “As trees became scarce and they could no longer construct wooden canoes for fishing, they ate birds.” This means that the islanders failed to construct (build) canoes with which they used to go fishing. So, the answer is: canoes Question 23: . . … they began using the island’s _______ as a food source, according to Diamond. Keywords for this question: began using, island’s, food source We came to know from the previous question that the islanders failed to build canoes with which they could fish. And so, what did they do? Line 10 of paragraph B gives us the clue. “As trees became scarce and they could no longer construct wooden canoes for fishing, they ate birds.” They started eating the birds of the island. So, the answer is: birds Question 24: …. .. .and that the methods of transporting the statues needed not only a great number of people, but also a great deal of _______. Keywords for this answer: methods of transporting, statues, great number of people, In paragraph C, we find the reference to the construction of the moai (the big statues). Here, in lines 4-5, the writer talks about how they might have moved the statues. “Diamond thinks they laid the moai on wooden sledges, hauled over log rails, but that required both a lot of wood and a lot of people.” Here, required = needed, a lot of people = a great number of people. So, the answer is: wood Question 25-26: (Choosing TWO answers from given options) Question 25 and 26: On what points do Hunt and Lipo disagree with Diamond? To find these answers, we need to look at points where Diamond discussed about a thing Hunt and Lipo disagreed with him. Let’s take a look at paragraph C where Diamond presumes, and the writer mentions, “they (the Rapanui people) laid the moai on wooden sledges; hauled over log rails, but that required both a lot of wood and a lot of people.” However, in paragraph E, Hunt and Lipo opines, and the author writes, “moving the moai required few people and no wood.” So, it can be gathered that Hunt and Lipo’s suggestion differs with Diamond about how the moai were transported. Again, in paragraph C, Diamond believes that the moai (the statues) accelerated the destruction of the island whereas in paragraph F, the writer opines, “Hunt and Lipo are convinced that the settlers were not wholly responsible for the loss of the island’s trees.” So, here, Hunt and Lipo disagree with Diamond’s view about the impact of the moai on Rapanui society. So, the answers are: B and C Cambridge 11 Test 2 Reading passage 3 The headline of the passage: Neuroaesthetics Questions 27-30: (Multiple Choice Questions) [Multiple choice questions are a common type of question set in the IELTS Reading test. It is also found in the Listening test. Most of the time, they come with four options but sometimes there are three options. Candidates need to work hard for this type of question because this may confuse them easily in passage 2 or passage 3. There will be long answers for each question, so they may kill valuable time. So, quick reading or skimming technique might come handy here. Remember that answers in 3 options out of 4 will be very close. So, vocabulary power will help a lot to choose the best answer.] [TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question 27: In the second paragraph, the writer refers to a shape-matching test in order to illustrate Keywords for this question: shape-matching test, illustrate In paragraph 2, the writer mentions in lines 4-6, “We certainly do have an inclination to follow the crowd. When asked to make … . . .. . people often choose a definitively wrong answer if they see others doing the same.” This clearly means that the writer gives reference to a shape-matching test with the aim of illustrating human tendency that is influenced by the opinions of others. So, the answer is: C Question 28: Angelina Hawley-Dolan’s findings indicate that people Keywords for this question: Angelina Hawley-Dolan’s findings In paragraph 3, in the last few lines, the writer mentions what Angelina Hawley-Dolan’s experiment shows. “… . .. . volunteers generally preferred the work of renowned artists, even when they believed it was by an animal or a child. It seems that the viewers can sense the artist’s vision in paintings, even if they can’t explain why.” Therefore, Angelina Hawley-Dolan’s findings point out that people have the capacity to recognize the intention behind artwork. So, the answer is: D Question 29: Results of studies involving Robert Pepperell’s pieces suggest that people Keywords for this question: results of studies, Pepperell’s pieces, suggest At the end of paragraph 4, in lines 6-7, the author argues that “It would seem that the brain sees these images as puzzles, and the harder it is to decipher the meaning, the more rewarding is the moment of recognition.” This indicates that the results of studies involving Robert Pepperell’s pieces give hint that people find it satisfying to work out what a painting signifies. Here, satisfying means rewarding, work out means decipher, what a painting means = the meaning So, the answer is: B Question 30: What do the experiments described in the fifth paragraph suggest about the paintings of Mondrian? Keywords for this question: experiments, suggest, paintings of Mondrian In the fifth paragraph, in lines 3-5, the writer points to the fact that “.. .. .. eye-tracking studies confirm that they (Mondrian’s) works are meticulously composed, and that simply rotating a piece radically changes the way we view it.” This implies that the paintings of Mondrian are more carefully designed than they seem to be. Here, experiments means studies So, the answer is: A Questions 31-33: (Summary completion with the given list of words) [In this kind of question candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. As these are fill in the blanks or gaps, there is a condition of writing the answers from given list of words for each answer and candidates must maintain this condition. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers to fill in the gaps. The letters for the words are the answers, so candidates must not put down the words.] Title of the summary: Art and the Brain Question 31: The discipline of neuroaesthetics aims to bring scientific objectivity to the study of art. Neurological studies of the brain, for example, demonstrate the impact which Impressionist paintings have on our ___________. Keywords for this question: the impact, Impressionist paintings have on our As the question starts with the aim of neuroaesthetics, we have to look for the answer in the first paragraph. In the first paragraph, the writer says in lines 3-5, “The blurred imagery of Impressionist paintings seems to stimulate the brain’s amygdala, for instance. Since the amygdala plays a crucial role in our feelings, that finding might explain why many people find these pieces so moving.” This indicates that Impressionist paintings greatly impact our feelings. Here, emotions = feelings So, the answer is: C Question 32: Alex Forsythe of the University of Liverpool believes many artists give their works the precise degree of _______ which most appeals to the viewer’s brain. Keywords for this question: Alex Forsythe, precise degree, most appeals to the viewer’s brain For this question, we have to jump to paragraph no. 7 where the writer mentions of Alex Forsythe. In paragraph 7, in lines 1-3, the writer says, “In another experiment, Alex Forsythe of the University of Liverpool analysed the visual intricacy of different pieces of art, and her results suggest that many artists use a key level of detail to please the brain.” Here, the writer means that Alex Forsythe believes many artists furnish their works with the exact scale of visual intricacy or complexity which most appeals to the viewer’s brain. So, the answer is: B Question 33: She also observes that pleasing works of art often contain certain repeated ________ which occur frequently in the natural world. Keywords for this question: pleasing works of art, repeated In paragraph 7, the writer argues in lines 4-8, “What’s more, appealing pieces both abstract and representational, show signs of ‘fractals’ -repeated motifs recurring in different scales. Fractals are common throughout nature, for example, in the shapes of mountain peaks of branches of trees. It is possible that our visual system, which evolved in the great outdoors, finds it easier to process such patterns.” So, pleasing or appealing works of art or pieces frequently contain certain repeated motifs/ patterns/ images which commonly appear in the natural world. So, the answer is: H Questions 34-39 (YES/NO/NOT GIVEN): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 34: Forsythe’s findings contradicted previous beliefs on the function of ‘fractals’ in art. Keywords for this question: contradicted, previous beliefs We find about Alex Forsythe in paragraph 7. But we find no information regarding any comparison between Forsythe’s findings and any previous beliefs in this paragraph and the following paragraph. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 35: Certain ideas regarding the link between ‘mirror neurons’ and art appreciation require further verification. Keywords for this question: link, mirror neurons, art appreciation, further verification In paragraph 8, the writer says in lines 1-5 “It is also intriguing that the brain appears to process movement when we see a handwritten letter, as if we are replaying the writer’s moment of creation. This has led some to wonder whether Pollock’s works feel so dynamic because the brain reconstructs the energetic actions the artist used as he painted. This may be down to our brain’s ‘mirror neurons’, which are known to mimic others’ actions. The hypothesis will need to be thoroughly tested…” Here, require further verification = the hypothesis will need to be thoroughly tested So, the answer is: YES Question 36: People’s taste in paintings depends entirely on the current artistic trends of the period. Keywords for this question: taste, current artistic trends At the end of paragraph 8, in lines 7-9, the writer mentions, “While the fashion of the time might shape what is currently popular, works that are best adapted to our visual system may be the most likely to linger once the trends of previous generations have been forgotten.” Therefore, we can safely say it is incorrect that people’s taste in paintings depends entirely on the current artistic trends of the period. It may stay as long as people remember the previous trends. Here, trend of the period = fashion of the time So, the answer is: NO Question 37: Scientists should seek to define the precise rules which govern people’s reactions to works of art. Keywords for this question: define precise rules, govern, reactions The last paragraph has the answer to this question. The writer says in lines 2-3, “It would, however, be foolish to reduce art appreciation to set a set of scientific laws.” Therefore, it can be gathered from the lines, it is not correct that scientists should seek to define the precise rules which govern people’s reactions to works of art. Here, rules = laws, people’s reactions to works of art = art appreciation So, the answer is: NO Question 38: Art appreciation should always involve taking into consideration the cultural context in which an artist worked. Keywords for this question: always, cultural context In the last paragraph, the writer says in lines 3-4, “We shouldn’t underestimate the importance of the style of a particular artist, their place in history and the artistic environment of their time.” This means that we should consider the cultural context in which an artist worked. So, the answer is: YES Question 39: It is easier to find meaning in the field of science than in that of art. Keywords for this question: easier, meaning in science, art In the final paragraph, we find a comparison between art and science, but they are only compared in terms of “looking for systems and decoding meaning so that we can view and appreciate the world in a new way”. There is no comparison in terms of which one’s meaning is easy or difficult. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 40: (Most appropriate subtitle) [In this kind of question (choosing title or subtitle), most of the students may face big difficulty. The good point about the question is that by the time you face question, you have already answered all the other questions. Try to locate the main idea of the passage for this question. In most cases, the introduction, the second paragraph and the conclusion may help you to trace this question.] Question 40: What would be the most appropriate subtitle for the article? In this passage about Neuroaesthectics, the writer gives reference to some scientific experiments or studies, theories and knowledge of the methods the brain shows reaction to abstract artworks. The main topic is mentioned in Paragraph no. 1 in the study of past masterpieces (“……has already given us a better understanding of many masterpieces). Interestingly, the writer asks in lines 1-2 of the second paragraph: “Could the same approach also shed light on abstract twentieth-century pieces .. .. . . …?” Then, our previous reading of the whole article shows that the writer tries to answer this question with some scientific experiments and theories of scientists and artists on artwork (Angelina Hawley-Dolan, Robert Pepperell, Mondrian, Oshin vartanian, Alex Forsythe, etc.) as a follow-through. For this reason, the most suitable subtitle for this article is some scientific insights into how the brain responds to abstract art. So, the answer is: A",

For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. Question 1: Around 3000 BC, according to legend: silkworm cocoon fell into emperor’s wife’s __________ Keywords for the question: 3000 BC, fell into, emperor’s wife We find the mention of 3000 BC in paragraph no. 1. So, we should try to locate the answer from here. The answer to this question can be found in paragraph no. 1 lines 14-17 where, the author writes, “It just so happened that while she was sipping some tea, one of the cocoons that she had collected landed in the hot tea and started to unravel into a fine thread.” So, the answer is: tea Question 2: – emperor’s wife invented a ______ to pull out silk fibres Keywords for the question: emperor’s wife, invented, pull out silk fibres The answer can be found in paragraph no. 1 lines 21-24. Here, the author writes, “She also devised a special reel to draw the fibres from the cocoon into a single thread so that they would be strong enough to be woven into fabric.” This means that the emperor’s wife devised or invented a reel to draw out or pull out silk fibres. So, the answer is: reel Question 3: Only _______ were allowed to produce silk Keywords for the question: only, were allowed to produce Paragraph no. 2 contains the answer to this question at the very beginning. Here, in lines 1-2, the author says, “Originally, silkworm farming was solely restricted to women and .. .. . .”. Here, the phrase solely restricted to women means that only women were allowed to farm silk. So, the answer is: women Question 4: Only _______ were allowed to wear silk Keywords for the question: only, allowed to wear In paragraph no. 2 lines 6-7 say, “…. . . only royalty were entitled to have clothes made of silk.” This clearly means that only royalty were allowed to wear silk clothes. So, the answer is: royalty Question 5: Silk used as a form of _______ g. farmer’s taxes consisted partly of silk Keywords for the question: silk used, form of, farmer’s taxes To locate this answer, we need to find the keywords farmer’s taxes and it can be found in lines 15-16 of paragraph no. 2. So, we need to look for the answer a few lines ahead because ‘farmer’s taxes’ is an example here. In lines 12-16, the writer says, “… . .. .silk was so prized that it was also used as a unit of currency. Government officials were paid their salary in silk, and farmers paid their taxes in grain and silk.” So, the answer is: currency Question 6: Silk used for many purposes g. evidence found of _____ made from silk around 168 AD Keywords for the question: 168 AD, many purposes, evidence The answer can be found at the end of paragraph 2. Here, in lines 20-23, the writer mentions, “The earliest indication of silk paper being used was discovered in the tomb of a noble who is estimated to have died around 168 AD.” So, it can be understood that paper made from silk was found around 168 AD. So, the answer is: paper Question 7: Merchants use Silk Road to take silk westward and bring back _______ and precious metals. Keywords for the question: Merchants, Silk Road, bring back, precious metals In paragraph no. 3, the author talks about trading of silk through Silk Road. In lines 3-5 of the paragraph, the author writes, “…. now known as the Silk Road, taking silk westward and bringing gold, silver and wool to the East.” So, the merchants took silk westward and traded them for precious metals like gold and silver and for wool. So, the answer is: wool Question 8: 550 AD: ______ hide silkworm eggs in canes and take them to Constantinople. Keywords for the question: 550 AD, hide, eggs, canes, Constantinople Answer to this question can be found in the middle of paragraph no. 4 where we can find the reference to Constantinople. Here, in lines 10-14, the writer says, “According to another legend, monks working for the Byzantine emperor Justinian smuggled silkworm eggs to Constantinople in 550 AD, concealed inside hollow bamboo walking canes.” So, the answer is: monks Question 9: 20th century: ______ and other manmade fibres cause decline in silk production. Keywords for the question: 20th century, manmade fibre, cause decline, To find the answer to this question, we need to locate the keywords ‘20th century’ and ‘decline in silk production’ which is found in the last paragraph. Here, the writer says in lines 7-8, “Then in the twentieth century, new manmade fibres, such as nylon, started to be used in what had traditionally been silk products, such as stockings and parachutes.” So, it can be understood that nylon was a man-made fibre. So, the answer is: nylon Question 10-13 (TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 10: Gold was the most valuable material transported along the Silk Road. Keywords for the question: gold, most valuable material In paragraph 3, the writer mentions in lines 1-8, “Demand for this exotic fabric eventually created the lucrative trade route now known as the Silk Road, taking silk westward and bringing gold, silver and wool to the East. It was named the Silk Road after its most precious commodity, which was considered to be worth more than gold.” So, it can be safely guessed that gold is not the most valuable material, it’s silk. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 11: Most tradesmen only went along certain sections of the Silk Road. Keywords for the question: tradesmen, certain sections In paragraph 3, the writer indicates that “The Silk Road stretched over 6,000 kilometers from Eastern China to the Mediterranean Sea .. .. . . Few merchants traveled the entire route; goods were handled mostly by a series of middlemen.” This clearly means that the journey through Silk Road was long enough for merchants to travel along; therefore, they only travelled along certain sections. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 12: The Byzantines spread the practice of silk production across the West. Keywords for the question: The Byzantines, spread In paragraph 4, from line 3, the writer mentions, “The Byzantines were as secretive as the Chinese, however, and for many centuries the weaving and trading of silk fabric was a strict imperial monopoly. Then in the seventh century, the Arabs conquered Persia, capturing their magnificent silks in the process. Silk production thus spread through Africa, Sicily and Spain as the Arabs swept through these lands.” Therefore, it was the the Arabs, not the Byzantines, who spread the practice of silk production across the West. So the answer is: FALSE Question 13: Silk yarn makes up the majority of silk currently exported from China. Keywords for the question: silk yarn, the majority, exported, China In the last paragraph, the writer says, “.. .. .in more recent decades, China has gradually recaptured its position as the world’s biggest producer and exporter of silk and silk yarn.” So, it is unclear from the lines whether silk yarn makes up the majority of silk currently exported from China, we only make out that both silk and silk yarn are exported, but there is no information on which product makes up the majority of silk exported from China. So the answer is: NOT GIVEN Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Great Migrations Questions 14-18: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 14: Local gulls and migrating arctic terns behave in the same way when offered food. Keywords for the question: local gulls, migrating arctic terns, behave, same way, offered food, In paragraph no. 2, the first few lines indicate the answer, “An arctic tern, on its 20,000 km flight from the extreme south of South America to the Arctic circle, will take no notice of a nice smelly herring offered from a bird-watcher’s boat along the way. While local gulls will dive voraciously for such handouts, the tern flies on. .. ..” The lines suggest that local gulls will be attracted to food offered while arctic terns will not pay attention to food when migrating; they behave differently. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 15: Experts’ definitions of migration tend to vary according to their area of study. Keywords for the question: experts’ definitions, migration, tend to vary, area of study, In paragraph no. 4, take a look at the first few lines, “But migration is a complex issue, and biologists define it differently, depending in part on what sorts of animals they study. .. .” Here,biologists = experts, define = definitions, differently = vary, depending in = according to, what sorts of animals they study = their area of study, So, the answer is: TRUE Question 16: Very few experts agree that the movement of aphids can be considered migration. Keywords for the question: very few experts, agree, movement, aphids, can be considered, migration, We find the mention of aphids’ movement in paragraph no. 5, “But daily vertical movements by zooplankton in the ocean – upward by night to seek food, downward by day to escape predators – can also be considered migration. So can the movement of aphids when, having depleted the young leaves on one food plant, their offspring then fly onward to a different host plant, with no one aphid ever returning to where it started.” However, no comparison has been made on experts’ opinion about aphids’ movement considered as migration. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 17: Aphids’ journeys are affected by changes in the light that they perceive. Keywords for the question: Aphids’ journey, affected, changes, light, they perceive, In paragraph no. 6, the answer to this question can be traced in lines 6-11, “ . .. . They allow for the fact that, for example, aphids will become sensitive to blue light (from the sky) when it’s time for takeoff on their big journey, and sensitive to yellow light (reflected from tender young leaves) when it’s appropriate to land. .. .” Here, when it’s time for takeoff on their big journey = aphids’ journey, will become sensitive to blue light sensitive to yellow light = affected by changes in the light, So, the answer is: TRUE Question 18: Dingle’s aim is to distinguish between the migratory behaviours of different species. Keywords for the question: Dingle’s aim, distinguish, migratory behaviours, different species, In paragraph no. 6, the answer is found in the last few lines “.. .. The value of his definition, Dingle argues, is that it focuses attention on what the phenomenon of wildebeest migration shares with the phenomenon of the aphids, and therefore helps guide researchers towards understanding how evolution has produced them all. ..” This means the aim of Dingle is to focus attention on the similarities between wildebeest migration and aphid migration, not to distinguish the migratory behaviours of different species. So, the answer is: FALSE Questions 19-22: Completing/Matching sentences with correct endings [For this type of question, candidates need to match the beginning and end of sentences. Candidates need to look for keywords in the sentence-beginnings and find the relative paragraphs and then sentences in the passage. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question 19: According to Dingle, migratory routes are likely to – Keywords for the question: Dingle, migratory routes, likely to, Take a look at lines 8-13 of paragraph no. 1, “ . .. . The biologist Hugh Dingle has identified five characteristics that apply, in varying degrees and combinations, to all migrations. They are prolonged movements that carry animals outside familiar habitats; they tend to be linear, . .. .” Here, tend to = likely to, linear = follow a straight line, So, the answer is: G (follow a straight line.) Question 20: To prepare for migration, animals are likely to – Keywords for the question: prepare, migration, animals, likely to, Again, in paragraph no. 1 at lines 14-16, the writer says, “ . .. . they involve special behaviours concerning preparation (such as overfeeding) and arrival; .. .” Here, preparation = to prepare for migration, overfeeding = eat more than they need, So, the answer is: C (eat more than they need for immediate purposes.) Question 21: During migration, animals are unlikely to – Keywords for this question: during, migration, animals, unlikely to, In paragraph no. 1, the writer mentions in lines 17-22, “ .. . And one more: migrating animals maintain an intense attentiveness to the greater mission, which keeps them undistracted by temptations and undeterred by challenges that would turn other animals aside.” Here, undeterred = unlikely to be discouraged, challenges = difficulties, So, the answer is: A (be discouraged by difficulties.) Question 22: Arctic terns illustrate migrating animals’ ability to – Keywords for this question: Arctic terns, illustrate, migrating animals’ ability, The answer is in lines 1-5 of paragraph no. 2, “An arctic tern, on its 20,000 km flight from the extreme south of South America to the Arctic circle, will take no notice of a nice smelly herring offered from a bird-watcher’s boat along the way. . .. .” Here, will take no notice of = ignore, nice smelly herring (food) = distractions, So, the answer is: E (ignore distractions.) Question 23-26: Summary completion with ONE word only [In this kind of question candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. As these are fill in the blanks or gaps, there is a condition of writing ONE, TWO or THREE words for each answer. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers to fill in the gaps.] Title of the summary: The migration of pronghorns Question 23: Pronghorns rely on their eyesight and _________ to avoid predators. Keywords for this question: Pronghorns, rely on, eyesight, to avoid, predators, Let’s take a look at paragraph no. 7 (where the writer talks about the Pronghorns) in lines 24-25, “ .. . Pronghorn, dependent on distance vision and speed to keep safe from predators, .. . .” Here, dependent on = rely on, vision = eyesight, keep safe = avoid, So, the answer is: speed Question 24: One particular population’s summer habitat is a national park, and their winter home is on the _________ where they go to avoid the danger presented by the snow at that time of year. Keywords for this answer: one particular population’s summer habitat, national park, winter home, where, go, avoid, danger, snow, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 7 in lines 6-12, “ .. . One population, which spends the summer in the mountainous Grand Teton National Park of the western USA, follows a narrow route from its summer range in the mountains, across a river, and down onto the plains. Here they wait out the frozen months, feeding mainly on sagebrush blown clear of snow. … .” Here, One population = one particular population, spends the summer = summer habitat, Grand Teton National Park = national park, they wait out the frozen months = their winter home, So, the answer is: plains Question 25: However, their route between these two areas contains three ________. Keywords for this answer: their route, these two area, contains, three, In paragraph no. 7, lines 13-16 say, “. .. . These pronghorn are notable for the invariance of their migration route and the severity of its constriction at three bottlenecks. .. . .” Here, route = migration route, So, the answers are: bottlenecks Question 26: One problem is the construction of new homes in a narrow __________ of land on the pronghorns’ route. Keywords for this answer: one problem, construction of new homes, narrow, land, pronghorns’ route, Take a close look at the last few lines of paragraph no. 7, “ . .. At one of the bottlenecks, forested hills rise to form a V, leaving a corridor of open ground only about 150 metres wide, filled with private homes. Increasing development is leading toward a crisis for the pronghorn, threatening to choke off their passageway.” Here, a crisis = one problem, Increasing development = construction of new homes, only about 150 metres wide = narrow, So, the answers are: corridor/passageway Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: Preface to ‘How the other half thinks: Adventures in mathematical reasoning Questions 27-34: Identifying information: [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 27: a reference to books that assume a lack of mathematical knowledge Keywords for this question: books, assume, lack of mathematical knowledge, In section D, the first lines say, “Other scientists have written books to explain their fields to non-scientists, but have necessarily had to omit the mathematics, . .. ..” Here, had to omit the mathematics = had to exclude the subject of mathematics thinking that the readers might have a lack of knowledge in mathematics, So, the answer is: D Question 28: the way in which this is not a typical book about mathematics Keywords for this question: the way, not, typical book, about mathematics, In section B, take a look at the last lines of the first paragraph and the first lines of the second paragraph, “. . . I want to reveal not only some of the fascinating discoveries, but, more importantly, the reasoning behind them. In that respect, this book differs from most books on mathematics written for the general public.” Here, this book differs from most books on mathematics = not a typical book about mathematics. The lines suggest that this particular book is not typically a book on mathematics. So, the answer is: B Question 29: personal examples of being helped by mathematics Keywords for this question: personal examples, being helped, by mathematics, Section G has three paragraphs and paragraphs no. 1 and 2 deal with examples provided in favour of mathematics by a physician and a lawyer. In the first paragraph, it says, “A physician wrote, ‘The discipline of analytical thought process [in mathematics] prepared me extremely well for medical school. . .. ..” In the second paragraph, we find another example from the experience of a lawyer. So, the answer is: G Question 30: examples of people who each had abilities that seemed incompatible Keywords for this question: examples, people, each had abilities, seemed incompatible, Take a look at the last few lines of Section C, “ .. . . To illustrate our human potential, I cite a structural engineer who is an artist, an electrical engineer who is an opera singer, an opera singer who published mathematical research, and a mathematician who publishes short stories.” Here, we can find the examples of different people having abilities that seem quite incompatible or mismatched. So, the answer is: C Question 31: mention of different focuses of books about mathematics Keywords for this question: different focuses of books, about mathematics, Section B has two paragraphs and the second paragraph says, “In that respect, this book differs from most books on mathematics written for the general public. Some present the lives of colorful mathematicians. Others describe important applications of mathematics. Yet others go into mathematical procedures, but assume that the reader is adept in using algebra.” Here, we can learn from these lines that books about mathematics have different focuses. So, the answer is: B Question 32: a contrast between reading this book and reading other kinds of publication Keywords for this question: contrast, reading this book, reading other kinds of publication, In Section E, look at lines 4-5, “ . .. . . You will turn these pages much more slowly than when reading a novel or a newspaper. .. .” Here, a novel or a newspaper = other kinds of publication, So, the answer is: E Question 33: a claim that the whole of the book is accessible to everybody Keywords for this question: claim, the whole of the book, accessible, everybody, Section A of the passage contains two paragraphs. In the first paragraph, the writer says in lines 6-7, “ . . .. Each of the eight chapters in this book illustrates this phenomenon. Anyone can understand every step in the reasoning.” Then, in the second paragraph, the writer says again, “ . .. . . Thus all readers will have the chance to participate in a mathematical experience, to appreciate the beauty of mathematics, and to become familiar with its logical, yet intuitive, style of thinking.” These lines suggest that the complete book is accessible to anyone. So, the answer is: A Question 34: a reference to different categories of intended readers of this book Keywords for this question: different categories, intended readers, of this book, In section F the author talks about categories of readers who can enjoy this book. “ .. . As I wrote, I kept in mind two types of readers: those who enjoyed mathematics until they were turned off by an unpleasant episode, usually around fifth grade, and mathematics aficionados, who will find much that is new throughout the book. This book also serves readers who simply want to sharpen their analytical skills . ….” So, the answer is: F Questions 35-40: Completing sentences with ONE WORD ONLY [In this type of question, candidates are asked to write ONE WORD ONLY to complete sentences on the given topic. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. TIPS: Here scanning technique will come in handy. Target the keywords of the questions to find the answers. Remember to focus on Proper nouns, random Capital letters, numbers, special characters of text etc.] Question 35: Some areas of both music and mathematics are suitable for someone who is a ___________. Keywords for this question: some areas, both music and mathematics, suitable for, Take a look at lines 1-2 in section A, as the writer says, “Occasionally, in some difficult musical compositions, there are beautiful, but easy parts – parts so simple a beginner could play them. So it is with mathematics as well. Here, easy parts – parts so simple = suitable for someone, So, the answer is: beginner Question 36: It is sometimes possible to understand advanced mathematics using no more than a limited knowledge of ___________. Keywords for this question: sometimes possible, understand, advanced mathematics, using, no more than, limited knowledge, In section A, lines 3-6 say, “ . … .. There are some discoveries in advanced mathematics that do not depend on specialized knowledge, not even on algebra, geometry, or trigonometry. Instead, they may involve, at most, a little arithmetic, such as ‘the sum of two odd numbers is even’, and common sense. … … .” Here, at most, a little = no more than a limited knowledge of, So, the answer is: arithmetic Question 37: The writer intends to show that mathematics requires _________ thinking, as well as analytical skills. Keywords for this question: the writer, intends to show, mathematics, requires, thinking, analytical skills, The answer can be found in section C lines 3-4, “ . .. . As the chapters will illustrate, mathematics is not restricted to the analytical and numerical; intuition plays a significant role.” Here, the writer means that in addition to analytical skills, mathematics requires or needs intuition, or intuitive thinking. So, the answer is: intuitive Question 38: Some books written by _________ have had to leave out the mathematics that is central to their theories. Keywords for this question: some books, written by, had to leave out, mathematics, central to their theories, To find the answer to this question, we have to go to section D. Here, in lines 1-2, the author writes, “Other scientists have written books to explain their fields to non-scientists, but have necessarily had to omit the mathematics, although it provides the foundation of their theories. . .. .” Here, had to omit = have had to leave out, provides the foundation = central, So, the answer is: scientists Question 39: The writer advises non-mathematical readers to perform __________ while reading. Keywords for this question: the writer, advices, non-mathematical readers, perform, while reading, In section E, the author says, “Still, the non-mathematical reader can go far in understanding mathematical reasoning. . .. . .. . . . . . It may help to have a pencil and paper ready to check claims and carry out experiments.” Here, carry out = perform, So, the answer is: experiments Question 40: A lawyer found that studying __________ helped even more than other areas of mathematics in the study of law. Keywords for this question: lawyer, found, studying, helped, more than other areas, mathematics, study of law, In Section G, paragraph no. 2, the writer mentions a lawyer, “A lawyer made the same point, “Although I had no background in law – not even one political science course — I did well at one of the best law schools. I attribute much of my success there to having learned, through the study of mathematics, and, in particular, theorems, how to analyze complicated principles. . ..” Here, I did well at one of the best law schools = helped even more than other areas of mathematics, So, the answer is: theorems",

      "content_clean": "Title of Reading Passage 1: Cork Question 1-5 : TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN Note: This type of question maintains a sequence. So, if you find the answer to question 2 in the first few lines of Paragraph 2, look for the answer to question 1 in paragraph 1. Strategies to answer the questions: This post may help you to answer this type of question easily. http://www.ieltsdeal.com/2018/01/13/ielts-reading-a-smart-strategy-to-handle-yes-no-not-given/ Now let’s look at the questions and explanations. The cork oak has the thickest bark of any living tree. Keywords for the question: thickest bark In paragraph 1 of the passage the author mentions, “Cork- the thick bark of the cork oak tree (Quercus suber) – is a remarkable material.” Again, in paragraph 2, the author mentions, “Its bark grows up to 20cm in thickness.” In both these lines, the word THICK is available. But, in our question, the phrase is the thickest bark. Here, the word thickest is in superlative form of adjective, which means this tree has to be in the rank no. 1 as far as thickness is concerned. There is no such comparison in the passage and it means that our answer is not available in the passage. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Scientists have developed a synthetic cork with the same cellular structure as natural cork. Keywords for the question: synthetic cork, same cellular structure, natural cork In paragraph 2 line 9-13, the author mentions the cellular structure of the bark of the cork oak “the bark of the cork oak has a particular cellular structure – with about 40 million cells per cubic centimetre – that technology has never succeeded in replicating”. Here, there is a clear contradiction or disagreement between the question and the above-quoted text from the passage. The question says, scientists have developed or discovered or invented an artificial synthetic cork that matches the cellular structure of natural cork. But the words “never succeeded in replicating” means that they have not been successful to make anything similar to the natural cork, with all of the same qualities. Here, the word replicate may create confusion as a new or unknown word, which means duplicate or same. So, the answer is: FALSE Individual cork oak trees must be left for 25 years between the first and second harvest. Keywords for the question: individual, 25 years, the first and second harvest Take a close look at paragraph 4, which talks about the harvesting of an individual cork oak tree. The author says, “From the planting of a cork sapling to the first harvest takes 25 years, and a gap of approximately a decade must separate harvests from an individual tree”. * Approximately a decade = nearly 10 years. So, the gap is 10 years, not 25 years. * A gap = must be left……….. between So, the answer is: FALSE Note: If there is only a numeric (number) difference between the question and the passage, the answer is always False. Here is a picture to explain question no. 3 in a better way. Cork bark should be stripped in dry atmospheric conditions. Keywords for the question: stripped, dry atmospheric conditions The word stripped is directly mentioned in paragraph 4 (Follow the order of the text from the previous question). Here, in line 15 the author states, “If the bark is stripped on a day when it’s too cold – or when the air is damp – the tree will be damaged”. This text agrees with the question, but in a reverse pattern. Here, the word “damp” is antonym for the word “dry”. So, the bark should not be stripped in damp atmospheric conditions; rather, it needs to be stripped in dry atmospheric conditions. So, the answer is: TRUE The only way to remove the bark from cork oak trees is by hand. Keywords for the question: only way, remove, by hand The answer is available in paragraph 5, where the author maintains, “No mechanical means of stripping cork bark has been invented, so the job is done by teams of highly skilled workers.” Stripping = remove Since the author’s negative statement “no mechanical means has been invented” suggests that there is no mechanical technology available to remove the bark, it has to be done by hand (the hands of highly skilled workers). So, the answer is: TRUE Question 6-13: NOTE-COMPLETION (One word only) Note: This type of question is nothing more than filling in the blanks. Read the title of the note, which is very important to have an idea about the questions and targeted paragraphs to find the answers. do not affect the ___________ of the bottle contents Keywords for the question: affect, bottle contents First, find the main keyword “bottle contents” and then scan the line carefully. The author states in paragraph 6, “Recent years have seen the end of the virtual monopoly of cork as the material for bottle stoppers, due to concerns about the effect it may have on the contents of the bottle…..The tiniest concentrations – as little as three or four parts to a trillion – can spoil the taste of the product contained in the bottle. The result has been a gradual yet steady move first towards plastic stoppers and, more recently, to aluminium screw caps.” Here, look at the synonymous links. Affect = spoil • Bottle contents = the product contained in the bottle These lines indicate that aluminium screw caps overcame one disadvantage of cork bottle stoppers, which is that they “spoil the taste of the product contained in the bottle”. So, it can be said that aluminium screw caps do not affect the taste of the product inside the bottle. So, the answer is: taste are ________ to produce Keywords for the question: produce are _______ to use Keywords for the question: use In the final sentence of paragraph 6, the author states, “These substitutes are cheaper to manufacture and, in the case of screw caps, more convenient for the user”. Here, These substitutes = aluminium screw caps Manufacture = produce, for the user = to use So, we can gather the meaning from here that they are cheaper to produce and more convenient for the user. However, the question requires ONE WORD ONLY, so the answers for question 7 and 8 have to be “cheaper” and “convenient”. Produce = manufacture To use = for the user So, the answers are: 7. cheaper 8. convenient Suit the ______ of quality products Keywords for the question: suit, quality products We find some information about quality products in the sentence in paragraph 7 line 3: “Firstly, its(the cork bottle stopper) traditional image is more in keeping with that of the type of high quality goods with which it has long been associated”. Here, the phrase “in keeping with” means “suit”. So the answer is “traditional image”, but the answer requires only one word, so it has to be “image”. It is because you have to choose noun between noun and adjective. Products = goods • In keeping with = suit So, the answer is: image made from a ______ material Keywords for the question: made from, material easily ______ In the very following sentence, the author mentions “Secondly – and very importantly – cork is a sustainable product that can be recycled without difficulty”. Recycling often is linked with the material. So the author is referring to its material here. The answer is “sustainable” and “recycled” Here, without difficulty = easily So, the answers are: 10. sustainable 11. recycled cork forests aid _______ Keywords for the question: cork forests, aid cork forests stop _____ happening Keywords for the question: cork forests, stop In paragraph 7 line 9-the end the author states about the cork forests – “Moreover, cork forests are a resource which support local biodiversity, and prevent desertification in the regions where they are planted. So, given the current concerns about environmental issues, the future of this ancient material once again looks promising”. Here, support = aid Prevent = stop. So the answers are clearly “biodiversity” and “desertification” So, the answers are: 12. Biodiversity 13. Desertification",

      "content_clean": "Reading Passage 1 The headline of Passage 1: The Risks agriculture faces in developing countries Question 1-3 (identifying information): This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. For this passage, first, answer question 4- 13. After finishing with these questions, come to question 1-3. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Question 1: a reference to characteristics that only apply to food production. Keywords for the answer: characteristics, only apply, food production In Paragraph A, line 1, the writer says, “Two things distinguish food production form all other productive activities.” Here, the word distinguish is a verb and it refers to differentiate one thing from the other. The rest of the paragraph is about food only. So, by placing the word distinguish here, the writer means that these two things only apply to food production. Also, in the question, the word characteristics is in plural form, which means there is more than one characteristic = two things. So, the answer is: A Question 2: a reference to challenges faced only by farmers in certain parts of the world. Keywords for the answer: challenges, only, farmers in certain parts of the world In Paragraph B the very first line deals with the challenges the farmers have to face all round the world = “Farmers everywhere face major risks, including …. . .”. Now, many candidates will think it says farming problems of the whole world. Don’t let the line fool you. Go through the next lines. Here, line 3 says, “However, smallholder farmers in developing countries must in addition deal with adverse environments, both natural .. .. . ..”. Developing countries = certain parts of the world. So, the answer is: B Question 3: a reference to difficulties in bringing about co-operation between farmers Keywords for the answer: difficulties, co-operation between farmers. *** This question will make you read all the paragraphs, but you will find the answer in paragraph H. That’s why I’ve instructed you not to touch this type of question at the beginning of your test. In paragraph H, lines 7-8 has a reference to Giel Ton who warns, “…that collective action does not come as a free good. It takes time, effort …… .” This line is a clear match with the difficulties of Collective actions (co-operation between farmers). So, the answer is: H Question 4-9 (matching statements with list of people): This question asks you to match the given statements with the list of people in the box below the question. Here, there are names of six agriculturists who have made different statements in the passage. First, find the main keyword of the question from the passage and then match other supporting keywords. Then, you can decide which person has made the selected statement. Read the instructions for the questions carefully. You may get confused sometimes if you don’t read the instructions. Question 4: Financial assistance from the government does not always go to the farmers who most need it. Keywords for the answer: financial assistance, does not always go to the farmers If you skim the paragraphs A, B, C and D, you can’t find the main keyword financial assistance there. But, paragraph E, line 7 has a word ‘subsidies’ which is synonymous with financial assistance. It also says in lines 10 and 11, “In fact, studies show that sixty percent of beneficiaries of subsidies are not poor, but rich… .. . .” The underlined part of the sentence matches with “does not always go to the farmers”. Here, farmers are not rich. The statement is made by Rokeya Kabir, Executive Director of Bangladesh Nari Progati Shangha. So, the answer is: D Question 5: Farmers can benefit from collaborating as a group. Keywords for the answer: benefit, collaborate, as a group The main keyword collaborating is synonymous to collective action and this phrase first appears in Paragraph H. So, it’s clear that the answer is in para H. Here lines 6 7 say, “collective action offers an important way for farmers to strengthen their political and economic bargaining power.” Here, the word strengthen can be replaced with benefit. The statement is made by Sophia Murphy, senior advisor to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. So, the answer is: B Question 6: Financial assistance from the government can improve the standard of living of farmers. Keywords for the answer: financial assistance, standard of living, farmers. The opening sentence of paragraph E, from where we found the answer of question 4, mentions the statement of Shennge Fan, who believes “…safety nets and public welfare programmes” are “…valuable ways to address poverty among farming families and reduce their vulnerability to agriculture shocks”. “Public welfare programmes” are actually those programmes which supply financial assistance. And “address poverty” and “reduce their vulnerability to agriculture shocks” means to “improve the standard of living”. The statement is made by Shennge Fan, Director General of the International Food Policy Research Institute. So, the answer is: C Question 7: Farmers may be helped if there is financial input by the same individuals who buy from them. Keywords for the answer: may be helped, financial input, same individuals, buy Skim to Paragraph I and you find these synonyms or some synonymous phrases. In line 8, there is a phrase “worth more attention” which is synonymous to “farmers may be helped”. Also, the part of the sentence in line 7 “consumers invest in local farmers….” matches with “financial input by the same individuals who buy from them”. The statement is made by Sonali Bisht, founder and advisor of INHERE, India. So, the answer is: G Question 8: Governments can help to reduce variation in prices. Keywords for the answer: governments, reduce, variation in prices There is a statement in paragraph D which deals with the reduction of variation in prices. Just focus on the words and phrases in the last three lines of paragraph D. There is a word ‘government’. The word ‘Mitigate’ means ‘reduce’. ‘Wild swings in food prices’ means ‘variation in prices’. The statement is made by Sophia Murphy, senior advisor to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. So, the answer is: B Question 9: Improvements to infrastructure can have a major impact on risk for farmers. Keywords for the answer: improvements to infrastructure, major impact, risk for farmers Skim to paragraph D where you’ve just found the previous answer to question 8. In lines 3, 4, 5 and 6, you find talks about improvements of infrastructures like roads, water, and food storage facilities etc. Also, here are other phrases which match with the question. Take a look: Major impact on risk for farmers = governments can significantly reduce risk for farmers (line 4) The statement is made by Kanayo F. Nwanze, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development. So, the answer is: A Question 10-13 (Multiple choice questions for two answers): This set of questions asks you to find TWO answers to the same questions. So, the main keyword/keywords will be same. Remember, you just need to find the two answers and put in boxes 10 and 11 of the answer sheet but you need not follow any sequence for that. Do the same for questions 12 and 13. Question 10 and 11: Which TWO problems are mentioned which affect farmers with small farms in developing countries? Keywords for the answer: problems, affect farmers with small farms, developing countries In paragraph B line 3, you can find the mention of smallholder farmers which means farmers with small farms. There is also a clear mention of developing countries. Now, in line 3 and 4 you will find a phrase adverse environment which matches with answer D = the effects of changing weather patterns. Also in the opening of paragraph G, the writer states, “… climate change and its consequences for small-scale agriculture”. Here, ‘Small-scale agriculture’ matches with ‘farmers with small farms’. So, the identifiable first problem is climate change and its consequences, which are a match with “the effects of changing weather patterns”. Answer: D Now, in paragraph I, the author talks about “the presence of intermediary purchasers” (line 2). “Purchasers” means “buyers”. Those people “… taking advantage of farmers’ vulnerability, dictate prices.” It’s the reason as farmers are bound to sell their goods to these intermediary buyers and these are the buyers who play with prices or dictate prices. Answer: E So, the answers are: D E (put answers in boxes 10 and 11 in any order) Question 12 and 13: Which TWO actions are recommended for improving conditions for farmers? Keywords for the answer: recommended, improving, conditions for farmers In paragraph H, as we’ve already read that collective actions can be beneficial for farmers. So, this matches with answer C where organizing co-operation …. is mentioned. In paragraph I, lines 7 and 8 there is a mention of “….community-supported agriculture, where consumers invest in local farmers by subscription and guarantee producers a fair price, ….” So, this matches with answer D where we find phrases like encouraging consumers and financial stakes. So, the answers are: C D (put answers in boxes 12 and 13 in any order) The headline of Passage 2: The Lost City Question 14-20 (List of headings/ Matching Headlines): In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph which will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Read the first two lines, and occasionally, the last line of each heading. In most cases, the answers are found here. Do it for all the paragraphs. Do not read too much. If you still don’t find the answers, only then, read the remaining texts. Question 14: Paragraph A In paragraph A, the answer is found in line 4 and line 6, at the end of the paragraph. Line 4 states, “…… His goal was to locate…..”. Line 6 states, “….. and Bingham’s plan was to… …” Both these lines have words like goal and plan which indicates that there was an aim of the trip. So, the answer is: iv The aim of the trip Question 15: Paragraph B In paragraph B, you can find the answer in line 2 and 3, where the writer says, “ ….. a track had recently been blasted down….” Again, you read further and in line 4, the writer also says, “Almost all previous travelers had left the river at Ollantaytambo and taken a high pass across the mountains to rejoin the river………. … .. . but also therefore never passing through the area around Machu Picchu.” It means that before Bingham’s expedition using the recent track, previous travelers had no idea that the recent route has existed. So, the answer is: vi A new route Question 16: Paragraph C In paragraph C, the last lines contain the answer. In lines 5 and 6 the writer says, “……. And Bingham also seems to have been less than keen on …… “ It means for the time being Bingham also lost his interest in the expedition. So, the answer is: viii Bingham’s lack of enthusiasm Question 17: Paragraph D As for paragraph D, the answer can be gathered both from first and last lines. In line 1, the author says, “….. Bingham writes about the approach in vivid style.” Line 7 and 8 says, “… It seemed like unbelievable dream….” Both in vivid style and unbelievable dream suggest that the description of Bingham was dramatic. So, the answer is: v A dramatic description Question 18: Paragraph E The answer to paragraph E lies in line 2 and 3 where he says, “ ….. His journey entries of the time reveal a much more gradual appreciation of his achievement.” This means he wrote more than what he saw. Also in line 5 and 6, the writer says, “….. rejoined his companions, to whom he seems to have said little about his discovery.” So, Bingham writes in his notebook many things but doesn’t tell his companions much. So, the answer is: i Different accounts of the same journey Question 19: Paragraph F In paragraph F, line 2 and 3, it is written, “…. . . When he came to write the National Geographic magazine article that broke the story to the world in April 1913, …” These lines suggest that Bingham wrote an article on Machu Picchu. So, the answer is: vii Bingham publishes his theory Question 20: Paragraph G In paragraph G, line 5 says, “ … An idea which has gained wide acceptance over the past few years…..”. Here, wide acceptance means that the idea became a common belief. So, the answer is: iii A common belief Question 21-24 (TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN): In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN Click here to learn more on how to tackle this type of question best. Question 21: Bingham went to South America in search of an Inca City. Keywords for the answer: went, South America, search, Inca city In paragraph A line 1, the writer says, “… . .. Hiram Bingham arrived in South America….”. In line 3, the writer also says, “…. . .exploration of the remote hinterland to the west of Cusco, the old capital of the Inca .. ..” So, the answer is: TRUE Question 22: Bingham chose a particular route down the Urubamba valley because it was the most common route used by travelers. Keywords for the answer: chose, particular route, down the Urubamba valley, the most common route In paragraph B, you can find the answer in line 2 and 3, where the writer says, “ ….. a track had recently been blasted down….” Again, you read further and in line 4, the writers also says, “Almost all previous travelers had left the river at Ollantaytambo and taken a high pass across the mountains to rejoin the river………. … .. . but also therefore never passing through the area around Machu Picchu.” It clearly means that before Bingham’s expedition using the recent track, previous travelers had no idea that the recent route have existed. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 23: Bingham understood the significance of Machu Picchu as soon as he saw it. Keywords for the answer: understood, significance, Machu Picchu, as soon as, saw In paragraph E, line 6 and 7, the writers says, “… . .. At this stage, Bingham didn’t realize the extent or the importance of the site….” The text clearly contradicts/doesn’t match with the question. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 24: Bingham returned to Machu Picchu in order to find evidence to support this theory. Keywords for the answer: returned, in order to, find, evidence The previous answer was taken from paragraph E. So, you need not go back. Just skim the next paragraphs. You will find no information regarding Bingham’s return to Machu Picchu. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 25-26 (Completing sentences with ONE WORD ONLY): In this type of question, candidates are asked to write only one word to complete the sentence. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. Question 25: The track that took Bingham down the Urubamba valley had been created for the transportation of …………………… . Keywords for the answer: the track, down the Urubamba valley, for transportation The answer can be found in paragraph B. Here, you can find in line 2 and 3, “…. .. a track had recently been blasted down… .. .. to enable rubber to be brought up by mules from the jungle.” It means that the recent route which Bingham used to reach Machu Picchu was made to transport rubber. So, the answer is: rubber Question 26: Bingham found out about the ruins of Machu Picchu from a …………………… in the Urubamba valley. Keywords for the answer: ruins of Machu Picchu, the Urubamba valley, from a This answer can be found in paragraph C line 1 there is a mention of the word valley. In lines 3 and 4, the writer says, “. . . .. . . up the nearby hill to see some ruins that a local farmer, Melchor Arteaga, had told them about … . .. . ”. So, it was a local farmer who told Bingham’s team about the ruins. So, the answer is: farmer The headline of Passage 3: The Benefits of Being Bilingual Question 27-31 (Matching tables; tests and findings) In this type of question, the candidates are asked to fill in the blanks in two tables where some tests and their findings are mentioned. There is a condition of writing the answer which is NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS. As these questions have gaps to fill in, you need to focus the words before and after the gaps. This will help you find the answers easily. Synonyms are important because the answers cannot be found as it is in the questions. Question 27: Observing the _________ of Russian-English bilingual people when asked to select certain objects. Keywords for the answer: Observing, Russian–English, when asked, select certain objects In paragraph B, the keyword Russian-English is found in line 10. So, the answer should be somewhere around it. Line 9 mentions a word ‘studying’ which is synonymous to ‘Observing’. The rest of the paragraph indicates selecting certain words like ‘stamp’ or ‘marka’. So, the will be studying eye movements (found in line 9 and 10). So, the answer is: eye movements Question 28: Bilingual people engage both languages simultaneously: a mechanism known as __________. Keywords for the answer: both languages, simultaneously, mechanism, known as In paragraph B, where we found the previous question’s answer, there are few words which match with the keywords for this answer. Here, in line 6 and 7, it is said that word recognition is ‘… . . not limited to a single language; auditory input activates corresponding words regardless of the language to which they belong.’ This is synonymous to “Bilingual people engage both languages simultaneously”. Also, mechanism = phenomenon and known as = called. So, the answer is: language co-activation Question 29: A test called the _______, focusing on naming colours. Keywords for the answer: test, called, naming colours In paragraph C, line 7 mentions the name of a test which is ‘Stroop Task’. The following line has a phrase ‘to name the colour’. So, the answer is: Stroop Task Question 30: Bilingual people are more able to handle tasks involving a skill called ________. Keywords for the answer: more able to handle, a skill called In paragraph C, line 6 and 7, the author states, “…. .. .. bilingual people often perform better on tasks that require conflict management.” This means that bilingual people are better (more able) to perform (handle) those tasks which require (involving) a special skill and that is conflict management. So, the answer is: conflict management Question 30: When changing strategies, bilingual people have superior ________. Keywords for the answer: changing strategies, have superior In paragraph C, line 14 and 15, the writer talks about switching between two tasks. This has a close relationship with the phrase changing strategies in the question. Then the writer says that when bilingual people do such tasks, they reflect better cognitive control (line 17). So, the answer is: cognitive control Question 32-36(YES/NO/NOT GIVEN): In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN Answers to these questions will follow a sequential order. So, if you find, for example, the answer to question 33, it means that the answer to question 32 is just before that. Question 32: Attitudes towards bilingualism have changed in recent years. Keywords for the answer: attitudes, have changed, recent years Start reading from the very beginning of the passage. In paragraph 1, line 2 and 3, the writer talks about the negative attitudes towards speaking two languages (….. In the past, such children were considered ….. . .. .) Then, in line 4-7, the writer says that the advancement in technology have helped to show that children who speak in two or more languages have several clear benefits (last line). This means that the attitudes have changed. So, the answer is: YES Question 33: Bilingual people are better than monolingual people at guessing correctly what words are before they are finished. Keywords for the answer: better than, at guessing correctly, what words, before, finished Paragraph B talks about the use of words while paragraph C talks about guessing words. But none of them shows any comparison on who is better in guessing correctly a word. There is no clear indication about the statement in the question 33. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 34: Bilingual people consistently name images faster than monolingual people. Keywords for the answer: consistently, name images, faster In paragraph C line, 2 and 3, the writer says a completely opposite thing. “…. .For instance, knowing more than one language can cause speakers to name pictures more slowly.” This line directly contradicts with the statement in question 34. So, the answer is: NO Question 35: Bilingual people’s brains process single sounds more efficiently than monolingual people in all situations. Keywords for the answer: brains process single sounds, more efficiently, in all situations In paragraph D, the author mentions “… When monolingual and bilingual adolescents listen to simple speech sounds without any intervening background noise, they show highly similar brain stem responses”. So, there is a proof of one situation, when there is no intervening background noise, at the time of the brain processing of both monolingual and bilingual people is “almost the same”. The given statement is only correct in the presence of background noise, but not in all situations. So, the answer is: NO Question 36: Fewer bilingual people than monolingual people suffer from brain disease in old age. Keywords for the answer: Fewer, suffer, brain disease, old age Paragraph F is the only place where the writer mentions the old age in terms of issues related to brain disease. But nowhere in the paragraph has the writer said anything about a comparison on who suffer from brain disease more- bilingual or monolingual. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 37-40 (identifying information): This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. You might as well find some answers quickly now, as you have already read the passage to find other questions and got a thorough idea about it. Question 37: An example of how bilingual and monolingual people’s brains respond differently to a certain type of non-verbal auditory input Keywords for the answer: example, brains, respond, differently, type of non-verbal auditory input In paragraph D, we find some information about brain responses. Actually, we already found it when answering question 35. There is a mention of ‘simple sound’ which can be a close match to non-verbal auditory input. So, the answer is: D Question 38: A demonstration of how a bilingual upbringing has benefits even before we learn to speak Keywords for the answer: demonstration, a bilingual upbringing, benefit, before we learn to speak In paragraph G, lines 1 to 3, we find phrases like “very early” which matches with even before we learn to speak, “seven-month-old babies growing” which matches with upbringing. In the last lines, there is a phrase ‘imparts advantages’ which matches with benefits. So, the answer is: G Question 39: A description of the process by which people identify words that they hear Keywords for the answer: description, process, identify words that they hear We have already read paragraph B, where the writer talks about how bilinguals identify words (in lines 2 and 3). So, further reading may not be necessary. Just check again the lines. So, the answer is: B Question 40: Reference to some negative consequences of being bilingual Keywords for the answer: negative consequences, being bilingual This is also an easy answer to find out because we have already covered it while reading paragraph C, line 2 and 3. The writer says, “For instance, knowing more than one language can cause speakers to name pictures more slowly.” So, the answer is: C",

A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph that will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence. Question 1: Paragraph A In paragraph A, the answer is found in line 7 where the writer says, “…. . .. the islands were colonized by one or two tortoises from mainland South America…”. And then continues, “……. .. . giving rise to at least 14 different subspecies…” These lines suggest that tortoises were populating the islands. So, the answer is: v Tortoises populate the islands Question 2: Paragraph B In paragraph B, line 3-4 says, “….. saw this exploitation grow exponentially.” The previous lines say that tortoises were taken on ships by pirates as food supply. Then line 3-4 talks about the increase of the exploitation. So, the answer is: iii Developments to the disadvantages of tortoise populations Question 3: Paragraph C For Paragraph C, the answer lies in line 2, where the author mentions, “….. In 1989, work began on a tortoise breeding centre……” suggesting that some people had started a conservation project to protect the tortoises. So, the answer is: viii The start of the conservation project Question 4: Paragraph D As for paragraph D, the answer is found in lines 4-5. Here, the writer states, “…. .. if people wait too long after that point, the tortoises eventually become too large to transport.” This means that if the timing is wrong, there is a big price to pay or they have to face a big problem. So, the answer is: i The importance of getting the timing right Question 5: Paragraph E The answer for paragraph E lies in lines 6-7. Here, the author says, “….to work out more ambitious reintroduction. The aim was to use a helicopter to move 300 of the breeding centre’s tortoises to various locations close to Sierra Negra.” It means that the plan is a very big one which is yet to occur. So, the answer is: iv Planning a bigger idea Question 6: Paragraph F In Paragraph F, the writer mentions the procedures which were taken to complete the transportation of 33 tortoises to relocate them to different parts of Galapagos Island. All the procedures indicate that the operation was carefully prepared. So, the answer is: vi Carrying out a carefully prepared operation Question 7: Paragraph G The answer for paragraph G is in line 3, where the author mentions, “Eventually, one tiny tortoise came across a fully grown giant …..”. So, the answer is: ii Young meets old Questions 8-13 (Completing sentences with ONE WORD ONLY): In this type of question, candidates are asked to write only one word to complete the sentence. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. Question 8: 17th Century: small numbers taken onto ships used by 8 _____________. Keywords for this answer: 17th Century, small numbers, ships used by For this question, we look at the paragraph where 17th century is mentioned. Start skimming from the beginning of the text. You’ll find the mention of 17th century in paragraph B. So, we can be sure that the answer will be in this paragraph. In line 2-3 the writer says, “… From 17th century onwards, pirates took a few on board for food, … … .”. Here, a few = small numbers. So, we can understand that those ships were used by pirates, who took small numbers of tortoises on their ships (on board) for food supply. So, the answer is: pirates Question 9 and 10: 1790s: very large numbers taken onto whaling ships kept for 9 _______ and also used to produce 10 _______. Keywords for these answers: 1790s, very large numbers, whaling ships, kept for, to produce For these questions, we have to look at paragraph 2 line 3. Here we find 1790s, which is our first clue. Then, when we read further, we find in lines 5 and 6, “…. The tortoises were taken on board these ships tq act as food supplies during long ocean passages. Sometimes, their bodies were processed into high-grade oil.” *Kept for = act as *To produce = processed So the answer for Q 9 is: food The answer for Q 10 is : oil Question 11: Hunted by 11 _________ on the islands Keywords for this answer: hunted In paragraph 2, the word ‘hunted’ is directly found in line 10—-“They hunted the tortoises……”. As ‘they’ is a pronoun, we have to read the previous line to learn what noun ‘they’ is referring to. “This historical exploitation was then exacerbated when settlers came to the islands.” Here, ‘they’ is referring to settlers. So, the answer is: settlers Questions 12 and 13: Habitat destruction: for the establishment of agriculture and by various 12 ______ not native to the islands, which also fed on baby tortoises and tortoise’s 13 ______ Keywords for these answers: Habitat destruction, establishment of agriculture, not native, also fed on, baby tortoises and tortoise’s Continue reading from the previous lines. The word ‘habitat’ is found in line 9, ‘establishment of agriculture’ in line 10. Then, in line 10, the author says, “They also introduced alien species- ranging from …..”. Here the word ‘alien’ is a match with ‘not native’. So the answer for Q 12 is: species After that, in line 11, we find, “- that either prey on the eggs and young tortoises… .. ..”. Here, prey on means fed on, young tortoises means baby tortoises. So the answer for Q 13 is: eggs Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: The Intersection of Health Sciences and Geography Questions 14-19: (Identifying Information) This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. For this passage, first, answer question 20- 26. After finishing with these questions, come to question 14-19. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Question 14: an acceptance that not all diseases can be totally eliminated Keywords for this answer: not all diseases, totally eliminated The information is found in paragraph D. Here, in lines 2 and 3, the writer says, “ … .. . diseases like polio are re-emerging, …..”. Re-emerging means coming back or not totally eliminated. So, the answer is: D Question 15: examples of physical conditions caused by human behaviour Keywords for this answer: physical condition, caused by, human behaviour The information is found in paragraph C. It is because, skimming the paragraph, we can gather information about various physical conditions such as asthma, lung problems, eyesight issues and more. We also find different human behaviours like the massive number of cars being driven, rapid industrialization, cutting down of forests etc. So, the answer is: C Question 16: a reference to classifying diseases on the basis of how far they extend geographically Keywords for this answer: classifying diseases, how far they extend geographically The information is found in paragraph F. We can find information like categorizing illnesses, diseases and epidemics in line 3 which is a match with classifying diseases. Also, line 4 says, “Health geographers can map the spread if illnesses….” means that they are mapping diseases on the basis of their extension geographically. So, the answer is: F Question 17: reasons why the level of access to healthcare can vary within a country Keywords for this answer: reasons, access to healthcare, vary within a country The information is found in paragraph G because there is a mention of healthcare provision and availability (or lack thereof) of healthcare resources to individuals and populations in line 1 and 2 which means access to healthcare. The next few lines show how healthcare can vary in different regions of a country with an example in lines 7, 8 and 9 (for instance, it may be very difficult……. .. … . .and the nearest hospital.) So, the answer is: G Question 18: a description of health geography as a mixture of different academic fields Keyword for this answer: health geography, mixture of different academic fields The information is found in paragraph D because lines 4-7 say, “Health geography is the combination of (mixture of), on the on hand, knowledge regarding geography and methods used to analyse and interpret geographical information, and on the other, the study of health, diseases and healthcare practices around the world.” So, the answer is: D Question 19: a description of the type of area where a particular illness is rare Keywords for this answer: type of area, particular illness is rare The information is found in paragraph B. It is because, in lines 6 and 7, it says, “Malaria is much less of a problem in high-altitude deserts, for instance.” This means malaria is rare in particular areas. So, the answer is: B Questions 20-26: (Completing sentences with ONE WORD ONLY) In this type of question, candidates are asked to write only one word to complete the sentence. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. Question 20: Certain diseases have disappeared thanks to better ________ and healthcare. Keywords for this answer: Certain diseases, disappeared, thanks to, In paragraph A, lines 1 and 2, it says, “While many diseases that affect humans have been eradicated (have disappeared) due to (thanks to) improvements in vaccinations and the availability of healthcare, …” This means that the improvements in vaccinations and availability of healthcare are responsible for the disappearance of certain diseases. But, our answer has to be in one word only. So, we choose vaccinations as the answer. It is because we cannot choose words like improvements or availability because they are adjectives. We have to give priority to nouns over adjectives. We cannot choose healthcare as the answer because we know that vaccinations are directly related to the eradication of major diseases. So, the answer is: vaccinations Question 21: Because there is more contact between people, __________ are losing their usefulness. Keywords for this answer: because, more contact, losing, usefulness We find phrases like people come into contact (more contact between people) and becoming more and more common (losing their usefulness) line paragraph A lines 3 and 6. So, the answer will be antibiotics. It is because the lines mean that when more people are coming in contact with each other more and more, antibiotics are becoming a common thing which means antibiotics are no longer as useful as it used to be before. So, the answer is: antibiotics Question 22: Disease-causing ________ are most likely to be found in hot, damp regions. Keywords for this answer: disease-causing, most likely, found, hot, damp regions We find reference of disease-causing and hot, damp regions in paragraph B lines 3-5 (“…. Is malaria-prone areas, which are usually tropical regions that foster a warm and damp environment in which the mosquitos that can give people this disease can grow.) So, the answer is: mosquitos Question 23: One cause of pollution is __________ that burn a particular fuel. Keywords for this answer: cause, pollution, burn a particular fuel, We know that there are some common fuels like wood, gas, coal, petrol, octane, diesel, etc. So, we need to find a word like these fuels. In paragraph C, line 6, we can find a word coal (“… … in addition to factories that run on coal power.”). So, we can gather from this line that factories burn coal. So, the answer is: factories Question 24: The growth of cities often has an impact on nearby __________. Keywords for this answer: growth of cities, an impact, Reading line 7 and 8 in paragraph C, we find phrases like expansion of big cities (matching with growth of cities) which indicate in the lines that it is responsible for cutting down of forests. So, we can realize that cutting down of forests is the impact which is caused by the growth of cities. So, the answer is: forests Question 25: _______is one disease that is growing after having been eradicated. Keywords for this answer: disease, growing, after, eradicated In Paragraph D line 2 and 3, we find an information of re-emerging or coming back of a disease named polio. Here, the line says, “… . .a world where diseases like polio are re-emerging,…..”. The word re-emerge matches with growing after having been eradicated. So, the answer is: polio Question 26: A physical barrier such as a _________ can prevent people from reaching a hospital. Keywords for this answer: physical barrier, prevent people, reaching a hospital For this answer we have to skim quickly and go to paragraph G. Here, in lines 7-9, we find the mention of a physical barrier which makes it difficult for people to get medical attention. The lines say, “….. .. .(for instance, it may be difficult for people to get medical attention because there is a mountain between their village and the nearest hospital).” So, the answer is: mountain Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: Music and the emotions Questions 27-31 (Summary completion with no more than TWO words) (In this kind of question candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. As these are fill in the blanks or gaps, there is a condition of writing ONE, TWO or THREE words for each answer. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers to fill in the gaps.) As the headline of the summary is The Montreal Study, we have to look for the Montreal Study in the passage. Look closely at the first line of the second paragraph, where it says, “A recent paper in Nature Neuroscience by a research team in Montreal, Canada,……”. So, it is very much likely that the answers to questions 27-31 may be found in the second and third paragraphs. Question 27: It was noted that the music stimulated the brain’s neurons to release a substance called 27 ______ Keywords for this question: music stimulated, neurons, release a substance In paragraph 2 lines 13 and 14, the writer mentions, “The first thing they discovered is that music triggers the production of dopamine— a chemical with a key role in setting people’s moods— by the neurons .. .. . ….”. It means that the substance which is released by the brain’s neurons is called dopamine. So, the answer is: dopamine Question 28: … .. . in two of the parts of the brain which are associated with feeling 28 ________ Keywords for this question: two of the parts, which are associated with, feeling In paragraph 2, the last lines say, “As these two regions have long been linked with the experience of pleasure,…..”. Here, we find some direct matches such as: *Two regions = two of the parts *Linked with = associated with *Experience = feeling So, the answer is: pleasure / of pleasure Question 29: Researchers also observed that the neurons in the area of the brain called the 29 ________ were particularly active just before the participants’ favourite moments in the music– …. Keywords for this question: observed, neurons, in the area of the brain, called In paragraph 3, the author says in the first lines, “What is rather more significant is the finding that the dopamine neurons in the caudate— a region of the brain…….” Here also, we can gather some direct matches such as: *observed = found *neurons = dopamine neurons * in the area of the brain = a region of the brain So, the answer is: caudate Question 30: were particularly active just before the participants’ favourite moments in the music— the period known as the 30 ________ Keywords for this question: particularly active, just before, participants’ favourite moment, period known as The answer is found in lines 3,4 and 5 in paragraph 3, where the author states, “ … . .. . — were at their most active around 15 seconds before the participants’ favourite moments in the music. The researchers call this the ‘anticipatory phase’…. .. .” So, the answer is: anticipatory phase Question 31: Activity in this part of the brain is associated with the expectation of ‘reward’ stimuli such as 31 ________. Keywords for this question: activity, associated with, reward stimuli, such as In this question, the phrase ‘such as’ indicates that we have to find an example of ‘reward stimuli’. Now, reading the third line of paragraph 3, we find such an example. “… .. .in anticipating food and other ‘reward’ stimuli—…” Here, anticipating can be a synonym of expectation. So, the answer is: food Questions 32-36 (Multiple Choice Questions) ‘Multiple Choice Question’ is a common type of question set in the IELTS Reading test. It is also found in the Listening test. Most of the time, they come with four options but sometimes there are three options. Candidates need to work hard for this type of question because this may confuse them easily in passage 2 or passage 3. There will be long answers, so they may kill valuable time. So, a quick reading or skimming technique might come handy here. Remember that answers in 3 options out of 4 will be very close. So, vocabulary power will help a lot to choose the best answer. Question 32: What point does the writer emphasise in the first paragraph? how dramatically our reactions to music can vary how intense our physical responses to music can be how little we know about the way that music affects us how much music can tell us about how our brains operate Keywords for this question: emphasise, first paragraph We have to use our skimming skills here. Let’s have a quick look at paragraph 1 and see if we can find any similarities between one of the options and any lines in the paragraph. In lines 2 and 3 of the first paragraph, the writer says, “And yet, even though music says little, it manages to touch us deeply.” After that, the writer gives a detail description of different body parts reacting extremely— “The pupils in our eyes dilate, our pulse and blood pressure rise, …. . .. . . .”. And the last line, “… .. .sound stirs us at our biological roots.” means that sound of music touches us very intensely. So, the answer is: B Question 33: What view of the Montreal study does the writer express in the second paragraph? Its aims were innovative. The approach was too simplistic. It produced some remarkably precise data. The technology used was unnecessarily complex. Keywords for this question: view of, Montreal study, second paragraph In lines 2 and 3 of the second paragraph, the author says, “….. in revealing the precise underpinnings of the potent pleasurable stimulus’ that is music.” It means that the Montreal Study has produced some precise data about music and pleasure. Further reading of the paragraph may clarify the answer. So, the answer is: C Question 34: What does the writer find interesting about the results of the Montreal study? the timing of participants’ neural responses to the music the impact of the music on participants’ emotional state the section of participants’ brains which was activated by the music the type of music which had the strongest effect on participants’ brains Keywords for this question: interesting, the results, Montreal Study In paragraph 3, line 1 says, “What is rather more significant…..” which means something interesting has been found. Then, in lines 3-4, it says, “….—were at their most active around 15 seconds before the participants’ favourite moments in the music.” So, it means that the interesting matter is the time of neuron’s response. So, the answer is: A Question 35: Why does the writer refer to Meyer’s work on music and emotion? to propose an original theory about the subject to offer support for the findings of the Montreal study to recommend the need for further research into the subject to present a view which opposes that of the Montreal researchers Keywords for this question: Why, refer to, Meyer’s work In paragraph 4 the writer describes in lines 7-9, “This is why composers often introduce a key note in the beginning of a song, spend most of the rest of the piece in the studious avoidance of the pattern, and then finally repeat it only at the end.” Now, in paragraph 5, the writer talks about Meyer’s work and thus supports what is said in paragraph 4. “….. … . .showing how Beethoven begins with the clear statement of a rhythmic and harmonic pattern and then, in an ingenious tonal dance, carefully holds off repeating it……. .. .. .. Beethoven saves that chord for the end.” So, the answer is: B Question 36: According to Leonard Meyer, what causes the listener’s emotional response to music? the way that the music evokes poignant memories in the listener the association of certain musical chords with certain feelings the listener’s sympathy with the composer’s intentions the internal structure of the musical composition Keywords for this question: Leonard Meyer, causes, listener’s emotional response In paragraph 6, lines 4-5 says, “…. .—Meyer argued that the emotions we find in music come from the unfolding events of the music itself. This “embodied meaning” arises from the patterns the symphony invokes and then ignores.” Here, the word ‘embodied’ means the internal part. So, the answer is: D Questions 37-40 (Completing sentences with the correct ending) [For this type of question, candidates need to match the beginning and ending of sentences. Candidates need to look for keywords in the sentence-beginnings and find the relative paragraphs and then sentences in the passage. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question 37: The Montreal researchers discovered that _____. Keywords for this question: Montreal researchers, discovered In lines 3-4 of paragraph 3, the writer says, “—were at their most active around 15 seconds before the participants’ favourite moments in the music.” This means that Montreal researchers have found that dopamine neuron becomes more active prior to (around 15 seconds before) the participants’ favourite moments in the music. So, the answer is: F neuron activity increases prior to key points in a musical piece. Question 38: Many studies have demonstrated that _____. Keywords for this question: Many studies, demonstrated In paragraph 4, lines 6-7 says, “Numerous studies, after all, have demonstrated that dopamine neurons quickly adapt to predictable rewards. If we know what’s going to happen next, then we don’t get excited.” It means neurons’ activity goes down if the result becomes known to the listener. So, the answer is: B neuron activity decreases if outcomes become predictable. Question 39: Meyer’s analysis of Beethoven’s music shows that _____. Keywords for this question: Meyer’s analysis, Beethoven’s music Line 7 and the last lines of paragraph 5 suggest that music of emotion, for example, Beethoven’s music makes a delay in giving what his listeners want to hear. Look closely at the lines: “……and then, in an ingenious tonal dance, carefully holds off repeating it.” And, “…… Beethoven saves that chord for the end.” So, the answer is: E emotive music delays giving listeners what they expect to hear. Question 40: Earlier theories of music suggested that _____. Keywords for this question: Earlier theories, suggested In the final paragraph, we find a reference of music from past time. Look at line 2-3 where the writer says, “While the earlier theories of music focused on the way a sound can refer to the real world of images and experiences—……”. Here, real world of images and experiences matches with actual pictures and events. So, the answer is: C emotive music can bring to mind actual pictures and events.",

For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. [TIPS: Here scanning technique will come in handy. Target the keywords of the questions to find the answers. Remember to focus on Proper nouns, random Capital letters, numbers, special characters of text etc.] Question 1 and 2: Early humans used a material called 1______ to make the sharp points of their 2 _____. Keywords for these answers: early humans, material, make sharp points, The answer is found in paragraph 1. Here, in the 1st line, a phrase is found (our earliest origins) which is synonymous to early humans. After that, in lines 2, 3 and 4, the author says, “……. Historians have discovered that a type of natural glass – obsidian – ……”. The synonym of sharp points is also found in line 7, ‘……. – was first used as tips of spears.” So, the answers are: 1. obsidian 2. spears Question 3: 4000 BC: 3 ______ made of stone were covered in a coating of man-made glass. Keywords for this answer: 4000 BC, stone, coating, man-made glass In paragraph A, lines 8-11 says, “Archaeologists have even found evidence of man-made glass which dates back to 4000 BC; this took the form of glazes used for coating stone beads.” Here, we can see the direct references from the questions to the keywords like man-made glass, 4000 BC, coating and stone. So, the thing that was made of stone was beads. So, the answer is: beads Question 4: First century BC: glass was coloured because of the 4 _____ in the material. Keywords for this answer: First century BC, was coloured, because In paragraph B, lines 3-5 says, “….. from the first century BC . The glass made during this time was highly coloured due to the impurities of the raw material.” Here, we can find some direct matches and synonyms for our selected keywords like: First century BC, highly coloured = coloured and due to = because So, the answer is: impurities Question 5: Until 476 AD: Only the 5 ______ knew how to make glass. Keywords for this answer: Until 476 AD, Only, knew how to make glass In paragraph 2, lines 9-17 say, “The secret of glass making was taken across Europe by the Romans during this century. However, they guarded the skills and technology required to make glass very closely, and it was not until their empire collapsed in 476 AD that glass-making knowledge became widespread throughout Europe and the Middle East.” These lines suggest that only the Romans knew about how to make glass until the collapse of their empire in 476 AD. So, the answer is: Romans Question 6 and 7: 17th century: George Ravenscroft developed a process using 6 ______ to avoid the occurrence of 7 ______ in blown glass. Keywords for these answers: 17th century, George Ravenscroft, developed a process, using, to avoid, in blown glass The answers for these questions are in paragraph 3 because we find the reference of the name George Ravenscroft here. There is also a reference to the invention of lead crystal glass. Then the author says in lines 5-8, “… … He attempted to counter the effect of clouding that sometimes occurred in blown glass by introducing lead to the raw materials used in the process.”. Here, counter = to avoid So, it can be understood here that George Ravenscroft developed a process by using lead so that the occurrence of clouding can be avoided. So, the answers are: 6. lead 7. clouding Question 8: Mid-19th century: British glass production developed after changes to laws concerning 8 _____. Keywords for this answer: Mid-19th century, British glass production, developed, after changes, laws concerning, In paragraph 4, lines 1-6 says, “In Britain, the modern glass industry only really started to develop after the repeal of the Excise Act in 1845. Before that time, heavy taxes had been placed on the amount of glass melted in a glasshouse, and were levied continuously from 1745 to 1845.” Here, we can gather from the text that British glass production was in a problem in the mid-19th century (1745-1845) when there were taxes for glass blowing industry. But after the Excise Act was repealed in 1845, the industry only started to develop. So, the answer is: taxes Questions 9-13 (TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN): In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer. Click here to learn more on how best to tackle this type of question. Question 9: In 1887, HM Ashley had the fastest bottle-producing machine that existed at the time. Keywords for this answer: 1887, HM Ashley, fastest, bottle-producing, existed at the time To find the answer for this question, find the given year (1887). If you just brush your eyes on each paragraph quickly, you will find the year in Paragraph 5. Now, read the first few lines and try to find the other keywords. In line 4, we can find HM Ashley, the name of the glass factory. In lines 7 and 8, the writer mentions, “…. – more than three times quicker than any previous production method.” This means HM Ashley was the fastest bottle-producing machine of that time. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 10: Michael Owens was hired by a large US company to design a fully-automated bottle manufacturing machine for them. Keywords for this answer: Michael Owens, was hired, by large US company, to design, fully-automated, machine The answer can be found in lines 8-10. Here, it is mentioned that Michael Owens owned a large US company, he was not hired by them. Check the lines, “……Michael Owens – founder of the Owens Bottle Machine Company (later the major manufacturers Owens-Illinois).” Here, founder = owner So, the answer is: FALSE Question 11: Nowadays, most glass is produced by large international manufacturers. Keywords for these answers: Nowadays, most glass, produced by, large international manufacturers For this question, look for the first keyword like Nowadays. In paragraph 6 line 1 starts with a word Today which is synonymous to Nowadays. But this paragraph talks about glass manufacture as a big industry. But nowhere in the paragraph has it discussed about the issue whether most glass production is done by large international manufacturers or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 12: Concern for the environment is leading to an increased demand for glass containers. Keywords for this answer: Concern, environment, leading to, increased demand In paragraph 7, the first few lines contain the answer. Here the lines say, “…… and with growing consumer concern for green issues, glass bottles and jars are becoming even more popular.” It means that the consumers of glass are worried about the environmental issues (green issues) and this is making the production of glass even more popular (increased demand). So, the answer is: TRUE Question 13: It is more expensive to produce recycled glass than to manufacture new glass. Keywords for this answer: more expensive, produce recycled glass, than, manufactured new glass In paragraph 7, lines 6-10 say, “….. As less energy is needed to melt recycled glass than to melt down raw materials, this also saves fuel and production costs.” So, it is clear that producing glass actually saves money which means it is less expensive. So the answer is: FALSE Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Bring back the big cats Questions 14-18: (Multiple Choice Questions) ‘Multiple Choice Question’ is a common type of question set in IELTS Reading test. It is also found in the Listening test. Most of the time, they come with four options but sometimes there are three options. Candidates need to work hard for this type of questions because this may confuse them easily in passage 2 or passage 3. There will be long answers for each question, so they may kill valuable time. So, quick reading or skimming technique might come handy here. Remember that answers in 3 options out of 4 will be very close. So, vocabulary power will help a lot to choose the best answer. Question 14: What did the 2006 discovery of the animal bone reveal about the lynx? A Its physical appearance was very distinctive. B Its extinction was linked to the spread of farming. C It vanished from Britain several thousand years ago. D It survived in Britain longer than was previously thought. Keywords for this answer: 2006 discovery, animal bone, reveal, lynx As we can easily find keywords like 2006 and animal bone in paragraph 1 lines 4-5, we can understand that the answer is in this paragraph. If we read further lines 9-11, we find that lynx died out 6000 years ago as previously presumed. But lines 16-18 suggest that timeline was actually 5000 years ago, not 6000 years ago. So, the lynx actually survived longer than previous presumption or belief. So, the answer is: D Question 15: What point does the writer make about large predators in the third paragraph? A Their presence can increase biodiversity. B They may cause damage to local ecosystems. C Their behavior can alter according to the environment. D They should be reintroduced only to areas where they were native. Keywords for this answer: large predators, third paragraph The phrase large predators in line 10 of 3rd paragraph. In this paragraph, lines 8-16 say that some of the large predators drive dynamic processes that affect the food chain and create niches (the conditions in which a type of living thing can live successfully) for many other species. Line 16 says: “The killers (lynxes or large predators) turn out to be bringers of life.” So, the answer is: A Question 16: What does the writer suggest about British conservation in the fourth paragraph? A It has failed to achieve its aims. B It is beginning to change direction. C It has taken a misguided approach. D It has focused on the most widespread species. Keywords for this answer: British conservation, fourth paragraph Lines 2-5 of paragraph 4 say: “….. .. .which has often selected arbitrary (not seeming to be based on a reason, system or plan and sometimes seeming unfair) assemblages of plants and animals and sought, at great effort and expense, to prevent them from changing.” It means that the assemblages of plants and animals was not based on reason, system or plan. So, the answer is: C Question 17: Protecting large areas of the sea from commercial fishing would result in – A practical benefits for the fishing industry. B some short-term losses to the fishing industry. C widespread opposition from the fishing industry. D certain changes to techniques within the fishing industry. Keywords for this answer: Protecting, large areas of the sea, commercial fishing The phrase protecting large areas of the sea can be found in paragraph 5 lines 2-3. The previous paragraph (paragraph 4) ends with a positive note that dynamism depends on large predators. Then paragraph 5 opens with the line, “At sea the potential is even greater: …..” Again, in lines 7-8 of paragraph 5, the writer says, “…..This policy would also greatly boost catches in the surrounding seas….” These lines suggest that there are some practical benefits of protecting large areas of the sea from commercial fishing. So, the answer is: A Question 18: According to the author, what distinguishes rewilding from other environmental campaigns? A Its objective is more achievable. B Its supporters are more articulate. C Its positive message is more appealing. D It is based on sounder scientific principles. Keywords for this answer: distinguishes, rewilding, other environmental campaigns We can see the key phrases like rewilding and environmental campaigns in first 3 lines of paragraph 6. In the same paragraph, in lines 7-8, we can see some information like “…… a more inspiring vision than .. .. .”. This is a clear match with the phrase “more appealing”. So, the answer is: C Question 19-22: (Summary completion from list of words) (In this kind of questions candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. As these are fill in the blanks or gaps, generally there is a condition of writing ONE, TWO or THREE words for each answer. For these questions, there is a fixed condition. Candidates must use the words given as a list with the questions which are marked with alphabets/letters. They must write the letters in the answer sheet, not the words. They need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. It must be remembered that the words on the list may not be found directly in the texts, so they need to look for synonyms. They should also follow the same steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps.) Title of the summary: Reintroducing the lynx to Britain There would be many advantages to reintroducing the lynx to Britain. While there is no evidence that the lynx has ever put 19 _______ in danger, it would reduce the numbers of certain 20 ________ whose populations have increased enormously in recent decades. It would present only a minimal threat to 21 _______, provided these were kept away from lynx habitats. Furthermore, the reintroduction programme would also link efficiently with initiatives to return native 22 ________ to certain areas of the country. A trees B endangered species C hillsides D wild animals E humans F farm animals Question 19: While there is no evidence that the lynx has ever put _______ in danger, Keywords for this answer: no evidence, lynx, put…..in danger, Line 1 of paragraph 7 says, “The lynx presents no threat to human beings: there is no known instance of one preying on people”. So, here we can see that no known instance is synonymous with no evidence and threat = put ….in danger. So, the answer is: E (humans) Question 20: it would reduce the numbers of certain ________ whose populations have increased enormously in recent decades. Keywords for this answer: reduce, number of certain, populations have increased enormously, recent decades Lines 7-10 of paragraph 7, “It is a specialist predator of roe deer, a species that has exploded in Britain in recent decades, holding back, by intensive browsing, attempts to re-establish forests. It will also winkle out sika deer: an exotic species that is almost impossible for human beings to control, as it hides in impenetrable plantations of young trees.” The bold words in these lines suggest that there are few species of wild animals (roe deer, sika deer) which have had an explosion in their populations and introducing lynx in their habitat may help to reduce the exploding numbers of those wild animals. So, the answer is: D (wild animals) Question 21: It would present only a minimal threat to _______, provided these were kept away from lynx habitats. Keywords for this answer: only a minimal threat, provided, kept away, from lynx habitats The answer lies in paragraph 7. Here, in lines 14-18, the author says, “…. The lynx requires deep cover, and as such presents little risk to sheep and other livestock, which are supposed, as a condition of farm subsidies, to be kept out of the woods.” Here, presents little risk = present only a minimal threat. So, it is said here that lynxs present almost no threat to animals like sheep and other livestock (farm animals). So, the answer is: F (farm animals) Question 22: Furthermore, the reintroduction programme would also link efficiently with initiatives to return native 22 ________ to certain areas of the country. Keywords for this answer: reintroduction programme, link efficiently, initiatives to return, native The answer is in paragraph 7 lines 11-13. Here, the author mentions, “…. The attempt to reintroduce this predator marries well with the aim of bringing forests back to parts of our bare and barren uplands.” Here, marries well = link efficiently The aim = initiatives Bringing back = return So, the reintroduction programme has the aim to return forests or trees. So, the answer is: A (trees) Questions 23-26: (YES/NO/NOT GIVEN): In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts the account in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer. Question 23: Britain could become the first European country to reintroduce the lynx. Keywords for this answer: first European country, reintroduce In paragraph 8 lines 9-12, it is mentioned, “…… The lynx has now been reintroduced to the Jura Mountains, the Alps, the Vosges in eastern France and the Harz Mountains in Germany, and has re-established itself in many more places.” Therefore, it is clear that Britain is not the first country to reintroduce the lynx. There are many others. So, the answer is: NO Question 24: The large growth in the European lynx population since 1970 has exceeded conservationists’ expectations. Keywords for this answer: large growth, since 1970, exceeded, conservationists’ expectations We find the keywords like since 1970, and large growth in lines 14-15, “… The European population has tripled since 1970 to roughly 10,000.” But there is no discussion whether it has exceeded the expectation of the conservationists. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 25: Changes in agricultural practices have extended the habitat of the lynx in Europe. Keywords for this answer: changes, agricultural practices, extend, habitat In paragraph 8, lines 15-19 say, “…. .. . As with wolves, bears, beavers, boar, bison, moose and many other species, the lynx has been able to spread as farming has left the hills and …..”. This means the lynx has spread out its habitat like some other species due to the fact that farming is no more done in the hills. So, the answer is: YES Question 26: It has become apparent that species reintroduction has commercial advantages. Keywords for this answer: apparent, species reintroduction, commercial advantages In paragraph 8, lines 20-21 say, “….. and people discover that it is more lucrative to protect charismatic wildlife than to hunt it. “ Here, lucrative means commercially beneficial. So, the answer is: YES Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: UK companies need more effective boards of directors Questions 27-33 (List of headings): In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph which will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. [TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question 27: Paragraph A In paragraph A, lines 6-8 talk about the responsible authority who are to blame for the problems. Here, it is mentioned, “…. .. . the search for explanations in the many post-mortems of the crisis has meant blame has been spread far and wide. Governments, regulators, central banks and auditors have all been in the frame.” So, the answer is: iv Question 28: Paragraph B In paragraph B, lines 2-3 deal with the impact of the scrutiny on the companies. The lines say, “…….. an issue of intense public debate and has significantly increased the pressures on, and the responsibilities of, directors.” So, the answer is: ii Question 29: Paragraph C In paragraph C, lines 2-3 talk about the less involvement of the board in meeting some important issues. The lines say, “….. .. . but can mean that the board as a whole is less involved in fully addressing some of the most important issues.” So, the answer is: vi Question 30: Paragraph D In paragraph D, lines 1-4 deals with a proposal for large companies which can solve the problem of operating the board. The lines say, “A radical solution, which may work for some very large companies whose businesses are extensive and complex, is the professional board, whose members would work up to three or four days a week, supported by their own dedicated staff and advisors.” We cannot say that it is a clean solution; rather it is a proposal because the writer is saying that it may work. So, the answer is: viii Question 31: Paragraph E In paragraph E, the answer lies in the first lines. Here, lines 1-2 say, “One of the main criticisms of boards and their directors is that they do not focus sufficiently on longer-term matters of strategy, sustainability, and governance.” It means that boards are not looking far enough. So, the answer is: vii Question 32: Paragraph F In paragraph F, the answer can be found in the first few lines. Here, in lines 1-2, the author says, “Compensation for chief executive has become a combat zone where pitched battles between investors, management and board members are fought, ….”. This means that there is an ongoing dispute about financial matters of the chief executives or senior managers. So, the answer is: i Question 33: Paragraph G In paragraph G, the answer is found in lines 5-6 where the writer says, “…… Boards of companies in all sectors will need to widen their perspective to encompass these issues and this may involve a realignment of corporate goals”. It means that boards in all sectors or every area need to change fundamentally in their corporate goals. So, the answer is: iii Questions 34-37 (YES/NO/NOT GIVEN): In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts the account in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer. Click here to learn more. Question 34: Close scrutiny of the behaviour of boards has increased since the economic downturn. Keywords for this answer: close scrutiny, behaviour of boards, increased, economic downturn In paragraph A line 4, we find the reference of economic downturn (the 2008 financial meltdown). In lines 8-10 of the same paragraph, the author says,” ….. The role of bank directors and management and their widely publicized failures have been extensively picked over and examined in reports, inquiries and commentaries.” Here, *the role = behaviour *extensively picked over = close scrutiny increased So, the answer is: YES Question 35: Banks have been mismanaged to a greater extent than other businesses. Keywords for this answer: banks, mismanaged, greater extent, than, other businesses. We cannot find any comparison on mismanagement between banks and other businesses in paragraph A, B or C. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 36: Board meetings normally continue for as long as necessary to debate matters in full. Keywords for this answer: Board meetings, continue, as long as, necessary, debate matters, in full In paragraph B, lines 10-12 say, “….. Agendas can become overloaded and this can mean the time for constructive debate must necessarily be restricted in favour of getting through the business.” This means that debates are restricted for the sake of business. So, the answer is: NO Question 37: Using a committee structure would ensure that board members are fully informed about significant issues. Keywords for this answer: committee structure, ensure, board members, fully informed, significant issues In paragraph C lines 1-2 say, “Often, board business is developed to committees in order to cope with the workload, which may be more efficient but can mean that the board as a whole is less involved in fully addressing some of the most important issues.” This means that using a committee cannot ensure that board members are informed about important issues. So, the answer is: NO Questions 38-40 (Completing sentences with ONE WORD ONLY): In this type of question, candidates are asked to write only word to complete the sentence. For this type of question, first skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. Question 38: Before 2008, non-executive directors were at a disadvantage because of their lack of _________. Keywords for this answer: before 2008, non-executive directors, at a disadvantage, because, lack of In paragraph D, lines 10-11 say, “…… where the executives had access to information that part-time non-executive directors lacked, leaving the latter unable to comprehend or anticipate the 2008 crash.” This means that the non-executive directors lacked or did not have access to information and could not anticipate the 2008 financial crash. So, the answer is: information Question 39: Boards tend to place too much emphasis on _________ considerations that are only of short-term relevance. Keywords for this answer: boards, place too much emphasis, considerations, of short-term relevance In paragraph E line 3, the writer says, “…. ..but instead concentrate too much on short-term financial metrics.” Here, concentrate too much = place too much emphasis So, the answer is: financial Question 40: On certain matters, such as pay, the board may have to accept the views of ___________. Keywords for this answer: pay, board, may have to, accept, views of From our finding in question 32 we came to know that there are often conflicts/debates between investors and boards concerning the matter of compensation, or in other words pay. Moreover, in paragraph F we have found that “shareholders use their muscle in the area of pay to pressure boards to remove underperforming chief executives”. The passage also says: “Their powers to vote down executive remuneration policies increased when binding votes came into force”. If a decision is “binding”, this means that it must be accepted by the board. For this reason, the only word to fill in this blank is either “investors” or “shareholders”. The word “compensation” is a clear synonym for payment or remuneration, so it has to do with money. So, the answer is: investors / shareholders",

Here, lines 1 and 2 say, “The website was set up to allow both individuals and travel organizations to create itineraries and travel packages to suit their own needs and interests.” This means that the aim of the website was to allow individuals and travel organizations do their work of their own, the website did not provide any ready-made itineraries and travel packages. The statement clearly contradicts the text. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 9: It was found that most visitors started searching on the website by geographical location. Keywords for this answer: started searching, geographical location The answer is not found anywhere in the passage. The question is about starting the search in the website. In paragraph 6 line 3, the author says, “…… visitors can search for activities not solely by geographical locations, but also by the particular nature of the activity.” However, nowhere it says anything about starting the search. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 10: According to research, 26% of visitor satisfaction is related to their accommodation. Keywords for this answer: 26%, visitor satisfaction, accommodation ** Special answer finding technique: There is a number in the question (26%). If the answer is TRUE, 26% has to be in the text. If it is FALSE, the number will be different; or, the number will be 26% (but it will be related to other matters). If the number is still 26%, yet it doesn’t match with other key-words, the answer will be NOT GIVEN. The answer can be found in lines 4, 5 6 of paragraph no. 6. Here, the writer says, “This is important as research shows that activities are the key driver of visitor satisfaction, contributing 74% to visitor satisfaction, while transport and accommodation account for the remaining 26%.” Here, the lines clearly contradict the question. Transportation and accommodation account for 26%. Visitor satisfaction accounts for 74%. If only accommodation accounted for 26%, we could write TRUE. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 11: Visitors to New Zealand like to become involved in the local culture. Keywords for this answer: like to, involved, local nature The answer can be found in lines 7-9 of paragraph 6. The author says, “…. It has also been found that visitors enjoy cultural activities most when they are interactive, such as visiting a marae (meeting ground) to learn more about traditional life.” It means that visitors like to engage in local culture. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 12: Visitors like staying in small hotels in New Zealand rather than in larger ones. Keywords for this answer: like staying, small hotels In paragraphs 6 7, there is no mention of staying in hotels. There is no comparison between small and large hotels also. So the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 13: Many visitors feel it is unlikely that they will return to New Zealand after their visit. Keywords for this answer: feel, unlikely, will return, after their visit The answer is found in paragraph 7. Here, lines 4 and 5 states, “Because of the long-haul flight, most visitors stay for longer (average 20 days) and want to see as much of the country as possible on what is often seen as a once-in-a-lifetime visit.” Here, the phrase ‘often seen as a once-in-a-lifetime visit’ means that there is a very low possibility that the visit will happen again. So the answer is: TRUE Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Why being bored is stimulating – and useful, too Questions 14-19: (List of headings) Follow the same rules of finding answers for List of Headings and check the first and last few lines of each paragraph. Most of the time, the answer is there for you containing some synonymous words, which have a match with the lists of headings. If you cannot find the answers in the first and last few lines, you may need to check the middle of the paragraphs. (This we did in other tests too.) Question 14: Paragraph A For this question, check line 3 of Paragraph A. The line says, “But defining boredom so that it can be studied in the lab has proved difficult.” Let’s analyse the sentence here. The phrase ‘has proved difficult’ in the sentence means that there is a problem with the science to define boredom. So, the answer is: iv (Problems with a scientific approach to boredom) Question 15: Paragraph B The answer is in lines 1-3 of the paragraph. Here, the writer says, “By asking people about their experiences of boredom, Thomas Goetz and his team at the University of Konstanz in Germany have recently identified five distinct types: indifferent, calibrating, searching, reactant and apathetic. These can be plotted … … .” So, we can gather from these lines that there is an explanation of how a team of scientists has classified the feelings of boredom. So, the answer is: vi (Creating a system of classification for feelings of boredom) Question 16: Paragraph C In lines 2 and 3 of Paragraph C, we can find a sentence about the finding of psychologist Sandi Mann of the University of Central Lancashire. “Mann has found that being bored makes us more creative.” This means that boredom can result in something good (productive outcomes). So, the answer is: i (The productive outcomes that may result from boredom) Question 17: Paragraph D We can get the answer having a quick look in lines 6-7 of paragraph D. The lines say, “… . .. But even if boredom has evolved to help us survive, it can still be toxic if allowed to fester.” The word ‘toxic’ here means poisonous or extremely bad or dangerous. So, the answer is: v (A potential danger arising from boredom) Question 18: Paragraph E We can get the idea of what paragraph E talks about reading the first 2-3 lines. Here the writer says, “Eastwood’s team is now trying to explore why the ‘attention system’ fails. It’s early days but they think that at least some of it comes down to personality. Boredom proneness has been linked with a variety of traits.” From these lines, we can gather that the researchers or scientists are working on the identification of people who are most prone or most affected by boredom. So, the answer is: viii (Identifying those most affected by boredom) Question 19: Paragraph F The first and second lines of paragraph F talks about a new theory about boredom – “…. that our over-connected lifestyles might even be a new source of boredom.” Then, in lines 4-5, the writer provides a possible treatment for this new source of boredom – “…. So instead of seeking yet more mental stimulation, perhaps we should leave our phones alone, and use boredom to motivate us to engage with the world in a more meaningful way . .. …”. So, the answer is: iii (A new explanation and a new cure for boredom) Question 20-23: (Matching names of people with their ideas or statements) (The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the name of the person and read around it carefully. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same person in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions may not follow any sequential order. ) Question 20: Peter Toohey In paragraph A, we find an idea shared by Peter Toohey. Look at the last lines – “If disgust protects humans from infection, boredom may protect them, from ‘infectious’ social situations .. . ..” It means boredom may help us to avoid an unpleasant situation. Here, infectious means displeasing/unpleasant. So, the answer is: E (Boredom may encourage us to avoid an unpleasant experience) Question 21: Thomas Goetz There are two references for Thomas Goetz in this passage – in paragraphs B E. So, we need to look at paragraph B first. In the first few lines, we can see that Goetz and his team have identified five types of boredom and when you read further, in lines 7-8, the writer states, “Of the five types, the most damaging is ‘reactant’ boredom with its explosive combination of high arousal and negative emotion.” So, the answer is: B (One sort of boredom is worse than all the others) Question 22: John Eastwood Again, there are two references to John Eastwood in paragraph D E. So, we need to look at paragraph D first. If we don’t find the answer there, we can have a look at paragraph E. In paragraph D, lines 7-9 say, “For Eastwood, the central feature of boredom is a failure to put our ‘attention system’ into gear. This causes an inability to focus on anything which makes time seem to go painfully slowly.” The lines indicate that if anyone tries and cannot focus on anything (attention system failure), this may give a bad feeling that the time has slowed down which may make anyone more and more irritated. So, the answer is: D (Trying to cope with boredom can increase its negative effects) Question 23: Francoise Wemelsfelder There is only one reference to Wemelsfelder and that’s in Paragraph F, the very last one. Take a careful look lines 1-2, “Psychologist Francoise Wemelsfelder speculates that our over-connected lifestyles might even be a new source of boredom.” This clearly indicates that our present lifestyle may inspire boredom. So, the answer is: A (The way we live today may encourage boredom) Questions 24-26: (Completing summary with ONE WORD ONLY): Question 24: For John Eastwood, the central feature of boredom is that people cannot ________, due to failure in what he calls the ‘attention system’,.. .. . . . Keywords for this answer: central feature, people cannot The question starts with the name of John Eastwood. So, we simply need to go to paragraph D and start looking for answers there. In line 7, we can see the phrase ‘central feature’. So, we can read this line – “For Eastwood, the central feature of boredom is a failure to put our ‘attention system’ into gear. This causes an inability to focus on anything.” Here, inability = cannot So, the answer is: focus Question 25: His team suggests that those for whom ______ is an important aim in life may have problems in coping with boredom, …. . . .. Keywords for this answer: suggests, important aim in life, may have problems In paragraph E, lines 3-4 says, “People who are motivated by pleasure seem to suffer particularly badly.” This means people who depend on pleasure, may have problems in coping with pleasure. So, the answer is: pleasure Question 26: …. whereas those who have the characteristic of ______ can generally cope with it. Keywords for this answer: characteristic, generally cope with it This answer needs some understanding. In lines 4 and 5, we see – “Other personality traits (characteristics), such as curiosity, are associated with a high boredom threshold.” Here, the word ‘threshold’ means the point where something changes or turns into something else. So, high boredom threshold means where boredom changes completely/ tendency to not get bored quickly. Thus, it further means people with curiosity can cope with boredom. So, the answer is: curiosity Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: Artificial Artists Questions 27-31: (Multiple Choice Questions) ‘Multiple choice questions’ is a common type of question set in the IELTS Reading test. It is also found in the Listening test. Most of the time, they come with four options but sometimes there are three options. Candidates need to work hard for this type of questions because this may confuse them easily in passage 2 or passage 3. There will be long answers for each question, so they may kill valuable time. So, quick reading or skimming technique might come handy here. Remember that answers in 3 options out of 4 will be very close. So, vocabulary power will help a lot to choose the best answer. TIP: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence. Question 27: What is the writer suggesting about computer-produced works in the first paragraph? Keywords for this answer: computer-produced works, first paragraph In the first paragraph, the answer to this question can be guessed from line 1. In line 1 the writer of the passage says, “The Painting Fool is one of a growing number of computer programs which, so their makers claim, possess creative talents.” Here, the phrase one of a growing number is a clear indication that the number of computer programs is on the rise. So, great progress has been made here. So, the answer is: B (A great deal of progress has already been attained in this field.) Question 28: According to Geraint Wiggins, why are many people worried by computer art? Keywords for this answer: Geraint Wiggins, worried by computer art The answer to this question can be found in line 5 of paragraph 2. Here the writer says, “…. It scares a lot of people. They are worried that it is taking something special away from what it means to be human.” Many of you (IELTS candidates) may think that the answer would be D (It will lead to a deterioration in human ability). But the answer cannot be it because the answer is in future form (..will lead..), while the lines in the text are in present form. Answer A and B are ruled out because there is no comparison on any aesthetic power between computer or human art and the line does not say anywhere that computer art may overtake or supersede human art. But answer C (It undermines a fundamental human ability) has a close relationship with the line. The line indicates to the fact that people are worried that machines like computer may have the powers which are found generally in humans. Thus, computer art can undermine or make human quality weaker. So, the answer is: C (It undermines a fundamental human ability) Question 29: What is a key difference between Aaron and the Painting Fool? Keywords for this answer: key difference, Aaron, Painting Fool The answer is in lines 2-5 of paragraph 4. Here, the author mentions some amazing and interesting features of the computer program named the Painting Fool – such as “only need minimal direction”, “can come up with its own concepts”, “runs its own web searches”, “trawls through social media sites”, “beginning to display a kind of imagination”, “creating pictures from scratch”. All these features or characteristics indicate that The Painting Fool is different from Aaron in its source of subject for painting. So, the answer is: C (the source of its subject matter) Question 30: What point does Simon Colton make in the fourth paragraph? Keywords for this answer: fourth paragraph, Simon Colton For this question, answer A is ruled out because there is no reference to anything childish and simplistic. There are also no points on whether people should apply the same concepts of creativity to all forms of art. So, answer B is also wrong. Take a close look at lines 7-8, where the author says, “….. Colton agrees that such reactions arise from people’s double standards towards software-produced and human-produced art.” Here, the phrase ‘double-standard’ matches with the phrase in answer D ‘different criteria’. So, the answer is: D (People tend to judge computer art and human art according to different criteria) Question 31: The writer refers to the paintings of a chair as an example of computer art which – Keywords for this answer: paintings of a chair In lines 12-14 of paragraph no. 4, we find the reference of the painting of a chair. “Some of the Painting Fool’s paintings of a chair came out in black and white, thanks to a technical glitch. This gives the work an eerie, ghostlike quality.” It means that though there was a glitch or problem in the program, it created an excellent black and white feature in the painting which was very attractive/striking/spooky (eerie, ghostlike quality). So, the answer is: A (achieves a particularly striking effect) Questions 32-37 (Completing sentence with given list of Ideas) Here, candidates have to complete sentences with a list of ideas. It is just like completing sentences. Candidates need to check the keywords from the question parts and try to match those keywords with the information given in the passage. Question 32: Simon Colton says it is important to consider long-term view when – Keywords for this answer: Simon Colton, important, long-term view The answer is in the first two lines of paragraph 5. Here, the writer says, “Researchers like Colton don’t believe it is right to measure machine creativity directly to that of humans who ‘have had millennia to develop our skills.’ These lines clearly indicate that we should not be so direct or so quick to compare machine creativity with human creativity because humans have had developed their skills in several millennia (thousand years) to become as creative as they are now, but machines have evolved only recently and more time is necessary to understand what machines can create. So, the answer is: D (comparing the artistic achievements of humans and computers) Question 33: David Cope’s EMI software surprised people by – Keywords for this answer: David Cope’s EMI, surprised people We find the mention of David Cope’s EMI software in lines 4-5 of paragraph 5. Then, in lines 7-8, we can find the answer. Here, the writer states, “Audiences were moved to experts into thinking they were hearing genuine Bach.” It means the audience was so moved by their experience of listening to machine-created music that they failed to distinguish (to find the difference) between machine-created music and human-created music.” So, the answer is: A (generating work that was virtually indistinguishable from that of humans) Question 34: Geraint Wiggins criticized Cope for not – Keywords for this answer: Geraint Wiggins, criticized, Cope We can see a criticism made by Geraint Wiggins about Cope’s EMI software in paragraph 5, lines 9-11. The author states, “Some, such as Wiggins, have blasted Cope’s work as pseudoscience, and condemned him for his deliberately vague explanation of how the software worked.” It means Wiggins does not like Cope’s work because it is pseudoscience (a kind of scientific work which is not what it claims to be) and Cope’s explanations about the work are vague (unclear/elusive). So, the answer is: E (revealing the technical details of his program) Question 35: Douglas Hofstadter claimed that EMI was – Keywords for this answer: Douglas Hofstadter, claimed, EMI The answer is found in lines 11-12 of paragraph 5. The lines say, “…. Meanwhile, Douglas Hofstadter of Indiana University said EMI created replicas which still rely completely on the original artist’s creative impulses.” So, the answer is: C (producing work entirely dependent on the imagination of its creator) Question 36: Audiences who had listened to EMI’s music became angry after – Keywords for this answer: Audiences, listened, EMI’s music, angry The answer lies in lines 13-14 of paragraph 5. Here, the author states, “When audiences found out the truth, they were often outraged with Cope, and one music lover even tried to punch him.” This means when audiences found out that they actually listened to music created by a machine, they were outraged or became angry at the creator of the program. So, the answer is: G (discovering that it was the product of a computer program) Question 37: The participants in David Moffat’s study had to assess music without – Keywords for this answer: participants, David Moffat’s study, assess music without To find the answer to this question, we must find David Moffat first. In paragraph no. 6, we find the name in line no. 2. The next lines give us clues to the answer. Here, in lines 3-4, the writer says, “He asked both expert musicians and non-experts to assess six compositions. The participants weren’t told beforehand whether the tunes were composed by humans or computers”. This means the listeners were not given information about the original composer until they listened to the music. So, the answer is: B (knowing whether it was the work of humans or software) Questions 38-40: (YES, NO, NOT GIVEN) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts the account in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 38: Moffat’s research may help explain people’s reactions to EMI. Keywords for this answer: Moffat’s research, help, explain, reactions, EMI We had to read the first half of paragraph 6 for question no. 37 before. Here, we learned that Moffat’s study was giving listeners six music compositions without telling them who the composers were. Now, the last half of the paragraph tells us how people might react to this. “People who thought the composer was a computer tended to dislike the piece more than those who believed it was human. This was true even among the experts, .. . .” So, the result of the experiment helps to understand people’s reactions. So, the answer is: YES Question 39: The non-experts in Moffat’s study all responded in a predictable way. Keywords for this answer: non-experts, Moffat’s study, all responded, predictable way There is no reference as to whether there was any predictable way to respond by non-experts in Moffat’s study. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 40: Justin Kruger’s findings cast doubt on Paul Bloom’s theory about people’s prejudice towards computer art. Keywords for this answer: Justin Kruger’s findings, cast doubt, Paul Bloom’s theory The last paragraph’s lines 1-5 give us the answer. Though we find here two views of Justin Kruger and Paul Bloom, these two views actually approve or support each other. Paul Bloom’s theory says, “…. . . .. part of the pleasure we get from art stems….. .” This matches with Justin Kruger’s experiments, “… . . have shown that people’s enjoyment of an artwork increases.” There is another clue: In Paul Bloom’s suggestion, there is a mention of ‘the creative process’. This also matches with Justin Kruger’s findings where we can see the mention of “more time and effort was needed to create it”. Thus, the two findings do not cast any doubt. Rather, one supports the other. So, the answer is: NO",

For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word. [TIPS: Here scanning technique will come in handy. Target the keywords of the questions to find the answers. Remember to focus on Proper nouns, random Capital letters, numbers, special characters of text etc.] Question 1: added to ______ Keywords for these answers: Biblical times, added We can easily find the answer to this question in lines 2-4 in paragraph no. 1. Here, the author of the passage states, “ ….. It was known in biblical times, and is mentioned in several books of the Bible, both as an ingredient that was mixed with oils for anointing people’s bodies . .. .” *mixed with = added to So, it is clear from the lines that in the biblical times cinnamon was added to oils. So, the answer is: oils Question 2: used to show _________ between people. Keywords for this answer: used, show, between people The answer to this question is in line 4 of paragraph no. 1. “…. . .people’s bodies and also as a token indicating friendship among lovers and friends.” *token indicating = show, lovers and friends = people So, the answer is: friendship Question 3: used for its sweet smell at __________. Keywords for this answer: Ancient Rome, used, sweet smell The answer can be found in paragraph 1, lines 5-6. The lines say, “In ancient Rome, mourners attending funerals burnt cinnamon to create a pleasant scent.” *pleasant scent = sweet smell This means cinnamon was burnt at funerals for creating a sweet smell. So, the answer is: funerals Question 4: was an indication of a person’s ________. Keywords for this answer: Middle ages, food, meat, indication, person’s We find the keywords Middle Ages, food, meat, etc. in lines 7-8 of paragraph no. 1. So, we continue reading from here. In lines 8-9, the author mentions, “… . . At a banquet, a host would offer guests a plate with spices piled upon it as a sign of the wealth at his or her disposal.” *sign = indication So, the answer is: wealth Question 5: known as a treatment for __________ and other health problems. Keywords for these answers: treatment, other health problems The last lines of paragraph 1 have the answer to this question. Here, in lines 11-12, the author states, “.. . .. Cinnamon was also reported to have health benefits, and was thought to cure various ailments, such as indigestion.” *cure = treatment, various ailments = other health problems So, the answer is: indigestion Question 6: grown in _______. Keywords for this answer: Middle ages, grown We can see another reference to the Middle ages in paragraph 2. So, we need to look carefully here for the word ‘grown’ or any similar words close to ‘grown’. In line 6 of paragraph no. 2, the writer says, “They took it from India, where it was grown, . . ..” So, the answer is: India Question 7: merchants used ________ to bring it to the Mediterranean Keywords for this answer: merchants, bring, Mediterranean In paragraph no. 2 line 6, the author mentions the word merchants in line 3, “ .. . . At that time, cinnamon was transported by Arab merchants, who closely guarded the secret of the source of the spice from potential rivals.” The next line has the answer. “. .. . They took it from India, where it was grown, on camels via an overland route to the Mediterranean.”. As we find the mention of the word Mediterranean, we can understand that they used camels to bring cinnamon to the Mediterranean. So, the answer is: camels Question 8: arrived in the Mediterranean at ________. Keywords for this answer: arrived in, Mediterranean The question has a preposition ‘at’ after the word Mediterranean. This means cinnamon arrived at a fixed place which is located in the Mediterranean region. In line 6 of paragraph no. 2, the author writes, “… .. to the Mediterranean. Their journey ended when they reached Alexandria.” So, the answer is: Alexandria Question 9: traders took it to ______ and sold it to destinations around Europe. Keywords for this answer: traders, took, sold, destinations, Europe The word ‘European’ and ‘traders’ are found in lines 6 and 7 of paragraph no. 2. Here, the author says, “… … European traders sailed there to purchase their supply of cinnamon, then brought it back to Venice. The spice then traveled from that great trading city to markets all around Europe.” This means the traders took cinnamon to Venice and then sold it all around Europe. So, the answer is: Venice Questions 10-13 (TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN): In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer. Question 10: The Portuguese had control over the cinnamon trade in Ceylon throughout the 16th century. Keywords for these answers: Portuguese, control, Ceylon, 16th century In paragraph no. 3, line 1, we find about the Portuguese. In the very next line, we can also see the word Ceylon. But candidates shouldn’t make mistake and start reading the whole paragraph because you won’t find the reference of 16th century here. All these keywords – Portuguese, Ceylon, 16th century – can be found together at the very end of paragraph no. 3. Go straight there and read the last few lines. In lines 10-12, the author says, “In 1518, the Portuguese built a fort on Ceylon, which enabled them to protect the island, so helping them to develop a monopoly in the cinnamon trade and generate very high profits. In the late 16th century, for example, they enjoyed a tenfold profit. … .” These lines directly indicate that the Portuguese built the fort on Ceylon to take a complete control of the cinnamon business, and by the 16th century, they got ten times more profit from it. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 11: The Dutch took over the cinnamon trade from the Portuguese as soon as they arrived in Ceylon. Keywords for this answer: The Dutch, cinnamon trade, the Portuguese, as soon as, arrived We can see the phrase ‘the Dutch’ in line 1 of paragraph no. 4. So, we need to find the information here. The Dutch, as mentioned in the paragraph, arrived in Ceylon ‘at the very beginning of the 17th century’. In lines 5-6, the writer says, “. .. .. . By 1640, the Dutch broke the 150-year Portuguese monopoly when they overran and occupied their factories.” Therefore, it is understood by us that it took the Dutch about 40 long years to take control of the Portuguese monopoly of cinnamon. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 12: The trees planted by the Dutch produced larger quantities of cinnamon than the wild trees. Keywords for this answer: trees, the Dutch, larger quantities, wild trees In paragraph no. 5, we can see the reference to cinnamon trees and wild trees. In the question, there is a comparison between local cinnamon trees and wild cinnamon trees on the quantities produced by trees planted by the Dutch and the wild trees. In the last lines, the writer says, “… .. Eventually, the Dutch began cultivating their own cinnamon trees to supplement the diminishing number of wild trees available for use.” But this doesn’t confirm for us about the quantity of cinnamon produced by the trees planted by the Dutch or wild species of cinnamon trees. So the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 13: The spice trade maintained its economic importance during the 19th century. Keywords for this answer: spice trade, maintained, economic importance, 19th century The final paragraph or paragraph no. 6 has the answer to this question. In the second line, we find the reference of the 19th century. So, we should read the line. Here, the writer says, “…. By the middle of the 19th century, production of cinnamon reached 1000 tons a year, after a lower grade quality of the spice became acceptable to European tastes.” It seems the answer may be TRUE. But if you read further in lines 6-7, you will find a contrasting picture. “.. .. Not only was a monopoly of cinnamon becoming impossible, but also the spice trade overall was diminishing in economic potential. .. .. . .” This means cinnamon trade could not maintain economic importance during the 19th century. So the answer is: FALSE",

Keywords for the question: magical kingdom, help develop We find the keyword ‘magical kingdom’ in paragraph no. 1. So, we should scan it carefully. In the last lines of the paragraph, the writer says, “Although she isn’t aware of it, this fantasy is helping her take her first steps towards her capacity for creativity and . . . .. ..” Here, helping her take her first steps towards her capacity = help develop So, the answer is: creativity Question 2: board games involve ___________ and turn-taking Keywords for the question: board games, turn-taking We find the keyword ‘board game’ in paragraph no. 2, line no. 3. So, we should scan it carefully. The line says, “Later on, when they tire of this and settle down with a board game, she’s learning about the need to follow rules and take turns with a partner.” Here, take turns with a partner = turn-taking So, the answer is: rules Questions 3-6 are under the title: Recent changes affecting children’s play Question 3: populations of ________ have grown Keywords for the question: recent changes, populations, grown The question asks us to find out recent changes regarding populations. We find the answer in paragraph no. 5, lines 1-2. “But we live in changing times, and Whitebread is mindful of a worldwide decline in play, pointing out that over half the people in the world now live in cities.” Here, we live in changing times = recent changes, over half the people = populations grown So, the answer is: cities Opportunities for free play are limited due to: Question 4 and 5 : fear of _________ Keywords for the question: opportunities, limited, fear of The answers can be found in lines 2-5 of paragraph no. 5. The writer says, “The opportunities for free play, …. . . . .. . . . .. . are becoming increasingly scarce.’ he says. Outdoor play is curtailed by perceptions of risk to do with traffic, as well as parents’ increased wish to protect their children from being the victims of crime.” Here, becoming increasingly scarce = limited, perceptions of risk = fear, parents’ increased wish to protect their children = fear So, the answers are (in any order): traffic crime Question 6: increased __________ in school Keywords for the question: increased, school The answer is in lines 5-6 of paragraph 5. The writer says here, “ . . .. .and by the emphasis on ‘earlier is better’ which is leading to greater competition in academic learning and schools.” Here, leading to greater = increased So, the answer is: competition International policies on children’s play: Question 7: it is difficult to find __________ to support new policies Keywords for the question: difficult to find, support new policies The answer is found in paragraph no. 6. Here, the author says, “International bodies like the United Nations and the European Union have begun to develop policies . … ..” Then in the last line, “ . .. .But what they often lack is the evidence to base policies on.” Here, what they often lack = it is difficult to find So, the answer is: evidence Question 8: research needs to study the impact of play on the rest of the child’s __________. Keywords for the question: research, need, study, rest of the child’s The answer lies in lines 2-3 of paragraph no. 8. In the previous paragraph (paragraph no. 7) the writer talks about the need of research to study the impact. Then, in paragraph no. 8, the mention the reaction of Dr Jenny Gibson, “Dr Jenny Gibson agrees, pointing out . .. ., there is very little data on the impact it has on the child’s later life.” Here, child’s later life = rest of the child’s life So, the answer is: life Questions 9-13: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 9: Children with good self-control are known to be likely to do well at school later on. Keywords for this question: good self-control, likely, do well, school, later The answer lies in paragraph no. 11, “In a study carried out by Baker with toddlers and young pre-schoolers, she found that children with greater self-control solved problems more quickly when exploring an unfamiliar set-up requiring scientific reasoning. ‘This sort of evidence makes us think that giving children the chance to play will make them more successful problem-solvers in the long run.” So, the lines clearly show that children with self-control do well in the long run (later on). So, the answer is: TRUE Question 10: The way a child plays may provide information about possible medical problems. Keywords for this question: the way child plays, may provide info, possible medical problems The answer lies in paragraph no. 13, where Dr Gibson says, “… Playful behaviour is also an important indicator of healthy social and emotional development. . .. . .. . . .give us important clues about their well-being and . .. .. . .. .useful in the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.” Here, the lines clearly shows that the way a child plays can be used to identify medical problems (autism). So, the answer is: TRUE Question 11: Playing with dolls was found to benefit girls’ writing more than boys’ writing. Keywords for this question: playing with dolls, benefit, girls’ writing, We find reference to playing with dolls in paragraph 14 line 4. But there is no comparison between girls’ writing and boys’ writing. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 12: Children had problems thinking up ideas when they first created the story with Lego. Keywords for this question: children, problems, thinking up ideas, first created, Lego The answer is found in lines 3-5 of paragraph no. 15. “…. Children wrote longer and better-structured stories when they first played with dolls representing characters in the story. In the latest study, children first created their story with Lego, with similar results.” The lines show the fact that children produced longer and better-structured story when playing with dolls and Legos. They did not face any problem there. In the last lines of the same paragraph the writer repeats the result. “With the Lego building.. .. .. …. The whole year of the project.” So, the answer is: FALSE Question 13: People nowadays regard children’s play as less significant than they did in the past. Keywords for this question: nowadays, children’s play, less significant, did in the past The first line of the last paragraph gives us the answer. “Somehow the importance of play has been lost in recent decades. It’s regarded as something trivial, or even as something negative that contrasts with ‘work’.” The lines suggest that nowadays (in recent decades) children’s play has become less significant (has been lost, …. Regarded as something trivial) So, the answer is: TRUE Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: SAVING THE SOIL Questions 14-17: (Summary completion with NO MORE THAN OEN WORD) (In this kind of questions candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. As these are fill in the blanks or gaps, there is a condition of writing no more than ONE, TWO or THREE words for each answer and candidates must maintain this condition. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps.) Question 14: Healthy soil contains a large variety of bacteria and other microorganisms, as well as plant remains and _________ . Keywords for this question: bacteria, microorganisms, plant remains The reference to bacteria and microorganisms is found in paragraph B, lines 4-6. So, our answer to this question is surely there. Here, the writer says, “A single gram of healthy soil might contain 100 million bacteria, as well as other microorganisms such as viruses and fungi, living amid decomposing plants and various minerals.” Here, decomposing plants = plant remains. So, the answer is: minerals Question 15: It provides us with food and also with antibiotics, and its function in storing ________ has a significant effect on the climate. Keywords for this question: food, antibiotics, storing, effect on the climate In paragraph B, lines 9-11 say, “… Soil is also an ally against climate change: as microorganisms within soil digest dead animals and plants, they lock in their carbon content, holding three times the amount of carbon as does the entire atmosphere.” Here, holding = store; an ally against climate change = a significant effect on climate change So, the lines mean that carbon content found in soil actually has a great effect on the climate or atmosphere. So, the answer is: carbon Question 16: In addition, it prevents damage to property and infrastructure because it holds _________. Keywords for this question: prevent damage, property, infrastructure, holds, The answer can be found in lines 11-13 of Paragraph B. Here, the writer gives reference to the prevention of damage done by flood, “….. .. .Soils also store water, preventing flood damage: in the UK, damage to buildings, roads and bridges from floods caused by soil degradation costs £233 million every year.” So, it means soil can store (hold) water, which can prevent damages to property and infrastructure (damage to buildings, roads and bridges) done by flood. So, the answer is: water Question 17: the main factor contributing to soil degradation is the ________ carried out by humans. Keywords for this question: main factor, soil degradation, carried out by humans In Paragraph C, lines 5-9 give us information about “Agriculture is by far the biggest problem …. Humans tend not to return unused parts of harvested crops directly to the soil to enrich it, meaning that the soil gradually becomes less fertile.” Here, biggest problem = the main factor Soil degradation = soil gradually becomes less fertile The lines mean that the way humans doing agriculture is affecting the fertility of the soil and it is degrading. So, the answer is: agriculture Question 18-21: (Completing sentences/sentence completion) [Here, candidates have to complete sentences by matching one part of the sentence with the other. The first part will be the question part and the second part will be the answer part. Candidates need to check the keywords from the question parts and try to match those keywords with the information given in the passage to match the answers.] Question 18: Nutrients contained in the unused parts of harvested crops Keywords for this question: nutrients, unused parts of harvested crops The answer is in lines 7-8 of paragraph C. Here the writer says, “Humans tend not to return unused parts of harvested crops directly to the soil to enrich it, meaning that the soil gradually becomes less fertile”. It means humans have the tendency not to put back the unused parts of harvested crops directly and thus the soil slowly becomes less fertile. So, the answer is: C Question 19: Synthetic fertilizers produced with the Haber-Bosch process Keywords for this question: Synthetic fertilizers, produced, Haber-Bosch process, In Paragraph D, line no. 3, we find the reference of the Haber-Bosch process. Then in lines 6-9 say, “…Chemical fertilisers can release polluting nitrous oxide into the atmosphere and excess is often washed away with the rain, releasing nitrogen into rivers. More recently, we have found that indiscriminate use of fertilisers hurts the soil itself, turning it acidic and salty, and degrading the soil they are supposed to nourish.” These lines suggest that the Haber-Bosch process may be responsible for the degradation of soil. So, the answer is: E Question 20: Addition of a mixture developed by Pius Floris to the soil Keywords for this question: mixture developed by Pius Floris In Paragraph E, line 1, we find the mention of Pius Floris, a farmer from the Netherlands. He developed a cocktail (mixture) which contained beneficial bacteria, fungi and humus. Then in line 7-10, the writer says, “When they applied Floris’s mix to the desert-like test plots, a good crop of plants emerged that were not just healthy at the surface, but had roots strong enough to pierce dirt as hard as rock”. Here, the lines mean that Pius Floris’ mixture or cocktail may improve the number and quality of plants. So, the answer is: A Question 21: The idea of zero net soil degradation Keywords for this question: zero net soil degradation We can find the answer to this question in lines1-7 of paragraph G. “We need ways of presenting the problem that bring it home to governments and the wider public, says Pamela Chasek… . .. ..and vice versa. Chasek and her colleagues have proposed a goal of ‘zero net land degradation.. . . .” Here, the lines indicate that zero net land degradation can be helpful for governments to be extra conscious about soil-degradation. So, the answer is: D Question 24-26 : (Identifying information) [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. For this passage, first answer question 4- 13. After finishing with these questions, come to question 1-3. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph.] Question 22: a reference to one person’s motivation for a soil-improvement project Keywords for this question: one person’s motivation, soil-improvement project The answer is in lines 1-3 of paragraph E. “One of the people looking for a solution to this problem is Pius Floris, who started out running a tree-care business in the Netherlands, and now advises some of the world’s top soil scientists.” This paragraph indicates how Pius Floris’ cocktail became successful against soil degradation. So, the answer is: E Question 23: an explanation of how soil stayed healthy before the development of farming Keywords for this question: soil stayed healthy, before, development of farming We find the reference of soil staying healthy in the second part (in the beginning) of paragraph C. Here, the writer says, “….. In the wild, when plants grow they remove nutrients from the soil, but then when the plants die and decay these nutrients are returned directly to the soil.” These lines explain how soil was healthy in natural-environmental process. Then, the writer again says, “….. Humans tend not to return unused parts of harvested crops directly to the soil to enrich it, meaning that the soil gradually becomes less fertile.” These lines mean that agriculture done by human has made the soil less fertile or unhealthy. So, the answer is: C Question 24: examples of different ways of collecting information on soil degradation Keywords for this answer: different ways of collecting information, soil degradation In paragraph F, lines 6-8 say, “Researchers from nine countries are working together to create a map linked to a database that can be fed measurements from field surveys, drone surveys, satellite imagery, lab analyses and so on to provide real-time data on the state of the soil”. All these are different systems by which scientists can collect data about soil degradation. So, the answer is: F Question 25: a suggestion for a way of keeping some types of soil safe in the near future Keywords for this answer: suggestion, keeping, some types of soil, safe, near future Answer to this question can be found in Paragraph G. Here, in lines 2-4, the writer says, “Chasek and her colleagues have proposed a goal of ‘zero net land degradation.” Here, proposed = suggestion, goal = target for near future, zero net land degradation = keeping soil safe So, the answer is: G Question 26: a reason why it is difficult to provide an overview of soil degradation Keywords for this answer: why, difficult, provide an overview, soil degradation The answer to this question is found in Paragraph F, lines 2-4, where the writer says, “To assess our options on a global scale we first need an accurate picture of what types of soil are out there, and the problems they face. That’s not easy. For one thing, there is no agreed international system for classifying soil.” Here, That’s not easy = it is difficult, picture of what types of soil are out there, and the problems they face = an overview of soil degradation So, the answer is: F Cambridge 13 Reading Test 4 Passage 3: The headline of the passage: Book Review Questions 27-29: (Multiple Choice Questions) [Multiple choice questions are a common type of question set in the IELTS Reading test. It is also found in the Listening test. Most of the time, they come with four options but sometimes there are three options. Candidates need to work hard for this type of question because this may confuse them easily in passage 2 or passage 3. There will be long answers for each question, so they may kill valuable time. So, a quick reading or skimming technique might come handy here. Remember that answers in 3 options out of 4 will be very close. So, vocabulary power will help a lot to choose the best answer.] [TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question 27: What is the reviewer’s attitude to advocates of positive psychology? Keywords for this question: reviewer’s attitude, advocates of positive psychology We can find the reference to ‘positive psychology’ in line 6 of paragraph no. 1. Here, the writer defines ‘positive psychology’. However, the mention of ‘advocates of positive psychology’ is found in line 12 of paragraph no. 2. The writer says in lines 2-5 about them, “Those who think in this way are oblivious to the vast philosophical literature in which the meaning and value of happiness have been explored and questioned, and write as if nothing of any importance had been thought on the subject until it came to their attention.” Here, as if nothing of any importance had been thought on the subject until it came to their attention means they are actually ignorant about the ideas which they should consider. *The word oblivious also means unaware or ignorant. So, the answer is: D Question 28: The reviewer refers to the Greek philosopher Aristotle in order to suggest that happiness Keywords for this question: Aristotle, We find the mention of Greek philosopher Aristotle in line 7 of paragraph no. 2. So, we need to scan the lines carefully. Here, the writer says in lines 6-10, “For Bentham it was obvious that the human good consists of pleasure and the absence of pain. The Greek philosopher Aristotle may have identified happiness with self-realisation in the 4th century,. .. . .. .. . but for Bentham all this was mere metaphysics or fiction.” The writer discusses here that Bentham considers happiness as only with pleasure and with the absence of pain. But for Aristotle it was not only pleasure and absence of pain. Rather, it was something that could be identified by self-realisation, which may not seem correct all the time. So, the answer is: A Question 29: According to Davies, Bentham’s suggestion for linking the price of goods to happiness was significant because Keywords for this question: Davies, Bentham’s suggestion, linking, price of goods, The answer is in the fourth paragraph, where the writer talks about price of goods. Here, in the last few lines, the writer says, “By associating money so closely to inner experience, Davies writes, Bentham ‘set the stage for the entangling of psychological research and capitalism that would shape the business practices of the twentieth century’.” The writer explains here that Bentham had associated money or price of goods with inner experience and thus made a connection between work and human psychology. So, the answer is: B Questions 30-34: (Summary completion with NO MORE THAN ONE WORD) [In this kind of question candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. As these are fill in the blanks or gaps, there is a condition of writing no more than ONE, TWO, or THREE words for each answer and candidates must maintain this condition. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers to fill in the gaps.] Title of the summary: Jeremy Bentham Question 30: In the 1790s he suggested a type of technology to improve _________ for different Government departments. Keywords for this question: 1790s, technology, to improve, different Government departments The answer to this question lies in paragraph no. 3, lines 6-7 where the author writes, “In the 1790s, he wrote to the Home Office suggesting that the departments of government be linked together through a set of ‘conversation tubes’.” These lines indicate that Bentham proposed to the Home office that Governmental departments should establish communication with Home office through ‘conversation tubes’. So, the answer is: F (communication) Question 31: He developed a new way of printing banknotes to increase ________ Keywords for this question: developed, new way, printing banknotes In paragraph no. 3, the author says in lines 8-9, “… and to the Bank of England with a design for a printing device that could produce unforgeable banknotes”. Here, unforgeable means something that cannot be forged or falsified or falsified. So, this means that Bentham actually developed a new way of printing banknotes to increase safety or security. So, the answer is: B (security) Question 32: and also designed a method for the ________ of food. Keywords for this question: designed, method, food The reference to food can be found in lines 9-10 of paragraph no. 3. “He drew up plans for a “frigidarium” to keep provisions such as meat, fish, fruit and vegetables fresh.” These lines directly refer to the preservation of food. So, the answer is: G (preservation) Question 33: He also drew up plans for a prison which allowed the _______ of prisoners at all times, … .. . . Keywords for this question: drew up plans, prison, allowed, prisoners The answer is in lines 10-12 of paragraph no. 3. Here, the author writes, “He celebrated design for a prison to be known as ‘Panoptieon’, in which prisoners would be kept in solitary confinement while being visible at all time to the guards, ….” Here, while being visible = under observation So, the answer is: E (observation) Question 34: when researching happiness, he investigated possibilities for its ________, and suggested some methods of doing this. Keywords for this question: investigated, possibilities, suggested some methods The answer to this question is also found in lines 1-2 of Paragraph no. 4. “If happiness is to be regarded as a science, it has to be measured,….” This means Bentham suggested the methods of taking measurement. So, the answer is: A (measurement) Questions 35-40 (YES/NO/NOT GIVEN): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN] [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 35: One strength of The Happiness Industry is its discussion of the relationship between psychology and economics. Keywords for this question: The Happiness Industry, discussion, relationship, psychology, economics The answer can be found in the first few lines of paragraph no. 5 “The Happiness Industry describes how the project of a science of happiness has become integral to capitalism. We learn much that is interesting about how economic problems are being redefined and treated as psychological maladies”. So, it is clear from these lines that there is a strong relationship between psychology and economics. So, the answer is: YES Question 36: It is more difficult to measure some emotions than others. Keywords for this question: difficult to measure, some emotions, The answer cannot be found in this passage. There is a sentence in paragraph 5 about the feeling of pleasure and displeasure that can be measured which gives further information for research management and advertising. “In addition, Davies shows how the belief that inner states of pleasure and displeasure can be objectively measured has informed management studies and advertising.” But it is not related to this question. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 37: Watson’s ideas on behaviourism were supported by research on humans he carried out before 1915. Keywords for this question: Watson’s ideas, behaviuorism, supported, research, humans, before 1915 The answer is found in lines 7-9 of paragraph no. 5 which directly contradicts the given question. “When he became president of the American Psychological Association in 1915, he had never even studied a single human being: his research had been confined to experiments on white rats.” This means Watson’s experiments were on rats, not on humans. So, the answer is: NO Question 38: Watson’s ideas have been most influential on governments outside America. Keywords for this question: Watson’s ideas, most influential, governments outside America In paragraph 5 there is no information about the impact of Watson’s ideas on countries outside the USA. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 39: The need for happiness is linked to industrialisation. Keywords for this question: need for happiness, linked, industrialisation Answer to this question can be found in the opening sentence paragraph no. 6 which talks about the need for happiness that is connected with labour market. “Modern industrial societies appear to need the possibility of ever-increasing happiness to motivate them in their labours.” This is a clear match with the question. So, the answer is: YES Question 40: A main aim of government should be to increase the happiness of the population. Keywords for this question: main aim, government, increase, happiness of the population The writer says in lines 2-3 in paragraph no. 6, “But whatever its intellectual pedigree, the idea that governments should be responsible for promoting happiness is always a threat to human freedom.” Our question asks to find out the aim. But we find out that this is a comment from the author, not a statement on the aim of government. So, the answer is: NO",

So, the answer is: TRUE Question 11: Playing with dolls was found to benefit girls’ writing more than boys’ writing. Keywords for this question: playing with dolls, benefit, girls’ writing, We find reference to playing with dolls in paragraph 14 line 4. But there is no comparison between girls’ writing and boys’ writing. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 12: Children had problems thinking up ideas when they first created the story with Lego. Keywords for this question: children, problems, thinking up ideas, first created, Lego The answer is found in lines 3-5 of paragraph no. 15. “…. Children wrote longer and better-structured stories when they first played with dolls representing characters in the story. In the latest study, children first created their story with Lego, with similar results.” The lines show the fact that children produced longer and better-structured story when playing with dolls and Legos. They did not face any problem there. In the last lines of the same paragraph the writer repeats the result. “With the Lego building.. .. .. …. The whole year of the project.” So, the answer is: FALSE Question 13: People nowadays regard children’s play as less significant than they did in the past. Keywords for this question: nowadays, children’s play, less significant, did in the past The first line of the last paragraph gives us the answer. “Somehow the importance of play has been lost in recent decades.

Keywords for this question: hotel managers, need to know, encourage, staff, remain The answer is in paragraph no. 9, first and last lines. Research done by Enz and Siguaw in 2000 concludes that, “. .. It is essential for hotel management to develop HRM practices that enable them to inspire and retain competent employees.” . .. .. . .. “This implies that it is beneficial for hotels managers to understand what practices are most favourable toincrease employee satisfaction and retention.” Here, inspire = encourage, retention = staff to remain So, the answer is: E (Enz and Siguaw) Question 28: The actions of managers may make staff feel they shouldn’t move to a different employer. Keywords for this question: actions, make staff feel, shouldn’t move, different employer The answer is found in paragraph no. 5, in the very first lines. “Ng and Sorensen (2008) demonstrated that when managers provide recognition to employees, motivate employees to work together, and remove obstacles preventing effective performance, employees feel more obligated to stay with the company.” Here, employees feel more obligated to stay with the company = staff feel they shouldn’t move to a different employer So, the answer is: D (Ng and Sorensen) Question 29: Little is done in the hospitality industry to help workers improve their skills. Keywords for this question: little, done, hospitality, help workers, imporve skills This answer can be traced in paragraph no. 4, at the very beginning. “Lucas also points out that ‘the substance of HRM practices does not appear to be designed to foster constructive relations with employees or to represent a management approach that enables developing and drawing out the full potential of people, . .. .” The lines suggest that such HRM practices does very little (or nothing) to help the employees hone (sharpen or improve) their full potential (skills).

Keywords for this question: Dissatisfaction, pay, not, only reason, hospitality workers change jobs In paragraph 9 (last lines) and paragraph 10 (first lines) we find the research result found by Maroudas et al. (et al.is a latin phrase which means and others.). In paragraph no. 9 the writer mentions the statement of Maroudas and others, “as achievement and recognition. When these factors are unfavourable, job dissatisfaction may result. Significantly, though, just fulfilling these needs does not result in satisfaction,but only in the reduction of dissatisfaction.” Then, in paragraph no. 10, there is another remark by Maroudas and others. “Employees also have intrinsic motivation needs or motivators, which include such factors as achievement and recognition. Unlike extrinsic factors, motivator factors may ideally result in job satisfaction.” These lines suggest that job dissatisfaction does not come only from pay, rather it may arise from other factors such as achievement and recognition. So, the answer is: C (Maroudas et al.) Questions 32-35 (YES, NO, NOT GIVEN) In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claims of the writer – YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claims of the writer – NO It is impossible to say what the writer thinks about this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 32: One reason for high staff turnover in the hospitality industry is poor morale.

Among the many cited reasons are low compensation, inadequate benefits, poor working conditions and compromised employee morale and attitudes.” So, the answer is: YES Question 33: Research has shown that staff have a tendency to dislike their workplace. Keywords for this question: staff, have, tendency, dislike, workplace The answer can be found in the beginning of paragraph no. 6. The writer gives account of the research done by Spector and others in 2000. “While it seems likely that employees’ reactions to their job characteristics could be affected by a predisposition to view their work environment negatively, no evidence exists to support this hypothesis.” So, the lines clarify the point that there is no proof (no evidence exists to support this hypothesis) that workers view their workplace negatively. The information contradicts with the given question. So, the answer is: NO Question 34: An improvement in working conditions and job security makes staff satisfied with their jobs. Keywords for this question: improvement, working conditions, job security, satisfied In paragraph 9, the writer gives reference to Herzberg (1966) who showed that when factors like working conditions and job security “… are unfavourable, job dissatisfaction may result.”.

Keywords for the question: Henderson, rarely visited, around Press estate, younger We find the keyword ‘Press Estate’ in paragraph no. 1. So, we should scan it carefully. In the last few lines of the paragraph, the writer says, “… .. .it owned Press Estate, 650 acres of……….. The family often stayed at Press Castle, the large … . . . .. . and Alexander spent much of his childhood in the area, .. . .” The lines suggest that Alexander’s family was a merchant family and they owned a huge property in Scotland including the Press estate and he spent a good deal of time there. So, he often (opposite to the word ‘rarely’) visited the Press Estate. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 2: Henderson pursued a business career because it was what his family wanted. Keywords for the question: pursued, business career, family wanted We find the answer in paragraph no. 2 of the passage. Take a look at lines 2-4, “. . . In 1849 he began a three-year apprenticeship to become an accountant. Although, he never liked the prospect of a business career, he stayed with it to please his family.” Here, he began a three-year apprenticeship to become an accountant = Henderson pursued a business career, he stayed with it to please his family = because it was what his family wanted So, the answer is: TRUE Question 3: Henderson and Notman were surprised by the results of their 1865 experiment. Keywords for the question: Henderson, Notman, surprised, results, 1865 experiment We find the reference of the 1865 experiments ‘with magnesium flares as a source of artificial light’ in paragraph no. 3. However, there is no mention of their surprise or astonishment about the experiment. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 4: There are many similarities between Henderson’s early landscapes and those of Notman. Keywords for the question: many similarities, early landscapes, Henderson, Notman The answers can be found in lines 1-3 of paragraph no. 4. The writer says, “In spite of their friendship, their styles of photography were quite different. While Notman’s landscapes were noted for their bold realism, Henderson for the first 20 years of his career produced romantic images, showing the strong influence of the British landscape tradition.” The lines clearly show that the works of Henderson and Notman did not have much similarities. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 5: The studio that Henderson opened in 1866 was close to his home. Keywords for the question: studio, opened, 1866, close, home The mention of Henderson’s studio opening is found in the first lines of paragraph no. 5, “In 1866, he gave up his business to open a photographic studio, …” But the location of the studio is not mentioned here. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 6: Henderson gave up portraiture so that he could focus on taking photographs of scenery. Keywords for the question: gave up, portraiture, focus, taking photographs, The answer is in lines 2-3 of paragraph no. 5, “From about 1870 he dropped portraiture to specialize in landscape photography and other views.” Here, landscape photography and other views mean photography of scenery, dropped means gave up, So, the answer is: TRUE Question 7: When Henderson began work for the Intercolonial Railway, the Montreal to Halifax line had been finished. Keywords for the question: Intercolonial Railway, Montreal to Halifax line, finished The answer can be found in paragraph no. 7 as we see the mention of ‘Intercolonial Railway’ in lines 6-7 of this paragraph. Let’s take a look at lines 5-8, “. .. .That same year, while in the lower St. Lawrence River region, he took some photographs of the construction of the Intercolonial Railway. This undertaking led in 1875 to a commission from the railway to record the principal structures along the almost-completed line connecting Montreal to Halifax.” The lines suggest that the Montreal to Halifax line was not yet completed at that time. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 8: Henderson’s last work as a photographer was with the Canadian Pacific Railway. Keywords for the question: last work, photographer, Canadian Pacific Railway The answer is in paragraph no. 8.

That summer he made his second trip west, photographing extensively along the railway line as fas as Victoria. He continued in this post until 1897, when he retired completely from photography.” So, the job with the CPR was his last work, where he did his work of photography extensively. So, the answer is: TRUE Questions 9-13: (Completing notes with ONE WORD ONLY) In this type of question, candidates are asked to write only one word/ no more than two words to complete note on the given topic.

There was little competing hobby or amateur photography before the late 1880s because of the time-consuming techniques involved and the weight of the equipment. People wanted to buy photographs as souvenirs of a trip or as gifts, …..” Here, the lines suggest that people bought Henderson’s photographs because of the little competition involved in this sort of hobby due to the time it took and the weight (heavy) of the equipment. So, the answer to question no. 11 is: equipment Again, in the next line, People liked to buy Henderson’s photos as souvenirs or as gifts. So, the answer to question no. 12 is: gifts Question 12 and 13: Travelling as a professional photographer: Question 12: took many trips along eastern rivers in a __________. Keywords for this question: many trips, eastern rivers, in, We find the mention of ‘eastern rivers’ in paragraph no. 7.

Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. For this passage, first answer question 4- 13. After finishing with these questions, come to question 1-3. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 14: why some people avoided hospitals in the 19th century Keywords for this question: people avoided, hospitals, 19th century, The answer lies in paragraph F in the first lines. Here, the writer says, “Much of the ingenuity present in 19th-century hospital and building design was driven by a panicked public clamouring for buildings that could protect against what was thought to be the lethal threat of miasmas – toxic air that spread disease.” These lines suggest that 19th-century people were feeling panicked (terrified) people shouting (clamouring) for such hospital designs that could protect them from miasmas. This means they were avoiding hospitals at that time. So, the answer is: F Question 15: a suggestion that the popularity of tall buildings is linked to prestige Keywords for this question: popularity, tall buildings, linked to prestige, The answer is in the last lines of paragraph C. The author writes, “. .. Short regards glass, steel and air-conditioned skyscrapers as symbols of status, rather than practical ways of meeting our requirements.” Here, the suggestion made by Alan Short means the tall buildings (skyscrapers) symbolizes status (prestige). So, the answer is: C Question 16: a comparison between the circulation of air in a 19th-century building and modern standards Keywords for this question: comparison, circulation of air, 19th century, modern standards, The answer can be found in the first lines of paragraph E. The writer says, “We discovered that 19th Century hospital wards could generate up to 24 air changes an hour – that’s similar to the performance of a modern-day, computer-controlled operating theatre.” So, we can find a clear comparison of the circulation of air between 19th Century building and modern-day buildings. So, the answer is: E Question 17: how Short tested the circulation of air in a 19th-century building Keywords for this question: how, Short tested, circulation of sir, 19th-century building, The second part of paragraph D is a description of how Short tested the circulation of air in Johns Hopkins Hospital building which was built in the 19th Century. “ “We spent three years digitally modeling Billings’ final designs”, says Short. “We put pathogens in the airstreams, modeled for someone with tuberculosis (TB) coughing in the wards and we found the ventilation systems in the room would have kept other patients safe from harm.” So, the answer is: D Question 18: an implication that advertising led to the large increase in the use of air conditioning Keywords for this question: advertising, large increase, air conditioning, The answer is the last lines of the second part of paragraph B. “ . .. . before the widespread introduction of air conditioning systems, which were ‘relentlessly and aggressively marketed’ by their inventors.” Here, ‘relentlessly and aggressively marketed’ means advertisements, widespread introduction means large increase So, the answer is: B Question 19-26: (Completing summary with ONE WORD ONLY) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to ONE WORD ONLY to complete a summary on the given topic. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word/words.] Title of the summary: Ventilation in 19th-century hospital wards Question 19: Professor Alan Short examined the work of John Shaw Billings, who influenced the architectural ____________ of hospitals to ensure they had good ventilation. Keywords for this answer: Alan short, examined, John Shaw Billings, influenced, architectural, ensure, ventilation, The answer is in the first part of paragraph D where we find the reference of Alan Short putting his interest in the works of John Shaw Billings. “Short’s book highlights a developing and sophisticated art and science of ventilating buildings through the 19th and earlier-20th centuries, including the design of ingeniously ventilated hospitals. Of particular interest were those built to the designs of John Shaw Billings, including the first John Hopkins Hospital in the US city of Baltimore (1873-1889).” So, the lines mean that Alan Short examined the works of John Shaw Billings, whose works influenced the designs of hospitals with great ventilation. So, the answer is: design(s) Question 20 and 21: He calculated that _________ in the air coming from patients suffering from _________ would not have harmed other patients. Keywords for this answer: calculated, in the air, patients suffering from, would not have harmed, other patients, The answers are found in the second part of paragraph D, “We spent three years digitally modelling Billings’ final designs,” says Short. “We put pathogens in the airstreams, modeled for someone with tuberculosis (TB) coughing in the wards and we found the ventilation systems in the room would have kept other patients safe from harm.” Here, digitally modelling means calculating, So, the answers are: pathogens tuberculosis Question 22: He also found that the air in _________ in hospitals could change as often as in a modern operating theatre. Keywords for this answer: also found, the air, in hospitals, could change, as often as, modern operating theatre, The answer lies in the first part of paragraph E, “We discovered that 19th-century hospital wards could generate up to 24 air changes an hour – that’s similar to the performance of a modern-day, computer-controlled operating theatre.” Here, similar to = as often as So, the answer is: wards Question 23: He suggests that energy use could be reduced by locating more patients in ________ areas. Keywords for this answer: suggests, energy use, could be reduced, locating, more patients, areas, The answer is found in the second part of paragraph E. “Communal wards appropriate for certain patients – older people with dementia, for example – would work just as well in today’s hospitals, at a fraction of the energy cost.” Here, at a fraction of the energy cost = energy use could be reduced So, the answer is: communal Question 24 and 25: A major reason for improving ventilation in 19th-century hospitals was the demand from the __________ for protecting against bad air, known as __________. Keywords for this answer: major reason, improving ventilation, 19th-century hospitals, demand from, for protecting against, bad air, known as, In paragraph F, look at the first lines, “Much of the ingenuity present in the 19th Century hospital and building design was driven by a panicked public clamouring for buildings that could protect against what was thought to be lethal threat of miasmas – toxic air that spread disease.” Here, the lines suggest that the public demanded protection against miasmas. So, the answers are: public miasmas Question 26: These were blamed for the spread of disease for hundreds of years, including epidemics of ______________ in London and Paris in the middle of the 19th century. Keywords for this answer: blamed, spread of disease, hundreds of years, epidemics of, in London and Paris, middle of the 19th century, The answer is in lines 3-5 of paragraph F, “Miasmas were feared as the principal agents of disease and epidemics for centuries, and were used to explain the spread of infection from the Middle Ages right through to the cholera outbreaks in London and Paris during in 1850s.” Here, the lines suggest that London and Paris city suffered from the epidemics (outbreaks) of cholera. So, the answer is: cholera Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: Why companies should welcome disorder Questions 27-34 (List of headings) [In this question type, IELTS candidates are provided with a list of headings, usually identified with lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc,). A heading will refer to the main idea of the paragraph or section of the text. Candidates must find out the equivalent heading to the correct paragraphs or sections, which are marked with alphabets A, B, C and so forth. Candidates need to write the appropriate Roman numerals in the boxes on their answer sheets. There will always be two or three more headings than there are paragraphs or sections. So, some of the headings will not be used. It is also likely that some paragraphs or sections may not be included in the task. Generally, the first paragraph is an example paragraph which will be done for the candidates for their understanding of the task. TIPS: Skimming is the best reading technique. You need not understand every word here. Just try to gather the gist of the sentences. That’s all. Read quickly and don’t stop until you finish each sentence.] Question 27: Section A The answer lies in paragraph no. 2 of Section A. “…. . .We are told that we ought to organise our company, our home life, our week, our day and even our sleep, all as a means to becoming more productive. Every week, countless seminars and workshops take place around the world to tell a paying public that they ought to structure their lives in order to achieve this.” These lines suggest that people are increasingly expected to organise their companies. So, the answer is: vi (What people are increasingly expected to do) Question 28: Section B The answer for this question is found in the first paragraph of Section B. Here, the writer complains that. . . “Ironically, however, the number of businesses that fail has also steadily increased. Work-related stress has increased. A large proportion of workers from all demographics claim to be dissatisfied with the way their work is structured and the way they are managed.” So, the answer is: i (Complaints about the impact of a certain approach) Question 29: Section C The answer is in lines 2-4 of section C, where we find reference of some recommendations regarding business activities which was given in the first half of the 20th century. “… .Writing in the first half of the 20th century, he designed a number of principles to improve the efficiency of the work process, which have since become widespread in modern companies.” So, the answer is: iii (Early recommendations concerning business activities) Question 30: Section D The first line of section D gives us the answer. The writer states, “New research suggests that this obsession with efficiency is misguided.” It means that the beliefs regarding efficiency are misguided or incorrect. So, the answer is: ii (Fundamental beliefs that are in fact incorrect) Question 31: Section E This question’s answer can also be traced to the first line of section E. “What’s more, recent studies show that order actually has diminishing returns.” It means the order (organisation) brings problems. Also, take a look at the following lines. “Order does increase productivity to a certain extent, but eventually the usefulness of the process of organisation, and the benefit it yields, reduce until the point where any further increase in order reduces productivity.” So, it is clear that order does more damage than progress. So, the answer is: ix (Evidence that a certain approach can have more disadvantages than advantages) Question 32: Section F The answer is in the last lines of section F. “These environments can lead to new solutions that, under conventionally structured environments …….. would never be reached.” Here, would never be reached = impossible So, the answer is: vii (How to achieve outcomes that are currently impossible) Question 33: Section G The second and third paragraph talks about the approach which is taken of Oction, a large Danish manufacturer of hearing aids and the former chairman of General Electric. So, the answer is: iv (Organisations that put a new approach into practice) Question 34: Section H The last lines of section H indicate the answer. Here, the writer says, “This research also shows that we should continually question whether or not our existing assumptions work.” It means there is no guarantee that any approach may work. So, the answer is: viii (Neither approach guarantees continuous improvement) Questions 35-37 (Completing sentences/sentence completion with ONE WORD ONLY) Here, candidates have to complete sentences by using ONE WORD ONLY from the passage. Candidates need to check the keywords from the question parts and try to match those keywords with the information given in the passage. Question 35: Numerous training sessions are aimed at people who feel they are not _________ enough. Keywords for this question: numerous, training sessions, aimed at, people who feel, The answer is in the second paragraph of Section A. Take a look at lines 2-5, “….We are told that we ought to organise our company, our home life, our week, our day and even our sleep, all as a means to becoming more productive. Every week, countless seminars and workshops take place around the world to tell a paying public that they ought to structure their lives in order to achieve this.” The lines suggest that countless seminars and workshops (Numerous training sessions) are targeted at people who are not productive. So, the answer is: productive Question 36: Being organised appeals to people who regard themselves as ____________. Keywords for this question: being organised, appeals, regard themselves, The answer is in the first lines of paragraph no. 2 of Section A. “This rhetoric has also crept into the thinking of business leaders and entrepreneurs, much to the delight of self-proclaimed perfectionists with the need to get everything right.” Here, self-proclaimed = regard themselves So, the answer is: perfectionists Question 37: Many people feel _________ with aspects of their work. Keywords for this question: many people feel, aspects of work The answer is in paragraph no. 1 of Section B. “A large proportion of workers from all demographics claim to be dissatisfied with the way their work is structured and the way they are managed.” Here, A large proportion of workers = Many people So, the answer is: dissatisfied Questions 38- TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the account in the text- TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the account in the text- FALSE The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 38: Both businesses and people aim at order without really considering its value. Keywords for this question: businesses and people, aim at, order, without considering, value, The answer is found in the last lines of Section D. The writer says, “The result is that businesses and people spend time and money organising themselves for the sake of organising, rather than actually looking at the end goal and structure of such an effort.” The lines mean that people and different businesses actually aim at order (organisation) rather than looking at the goals. So, they are not considering the real value of order but aiming at it for the sake of organising. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 39: Innovation is most successful if the people involved have distinct roles. Keywords for this question: innovation, most successful, people involved, distinct roles, We can find the answer for this question in Section F. Here, in the first lines, the writer says, “In fact, research shows that, when innovating, the best approach is to create an environment devoid of structure and hierarchy and enable everyone to engage as one organic group.” Here, one organic group is an antonym for distinct roles. So, the lines suggest that if people work together as one organic group, innovation is most successful, not if people have distinct roles. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 40: Google was inspired to adopt flexibility by the success of General Electric. Keywords for this question: innovation, most successful, people involved, distinct roles, In Section G, we find the mention of different companies who adopted flexibility. In paragraph no. 2 of Section G, the writer mentions, “Google and a number of other tech companies have embraced (at least in part) these kinds of flexible structures, . . . .” But, there is no mention of the fact that Google was or was not inspired to adopt flexibility by General Electric. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN",

Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. For this passage, first answer question 4- 13. After finishing with these questions, come to question 1-3. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 1: information about how non-scientists’ assumptions about intelligence influence their behaviour towards others Keywords for the question: non-scientist’s assumptions, intelligence, influence, behaviour towards others, The answer is in paragraph B where the writer gives reference to the assumptions (theories) of non-scientists such as parents, people in job interviews and other general people. Let’s take a look at lines 4-7, “For example, parent’s implicit theories of their children’s language development will determine at what ages they will be willing to make various corrections in their children’s speech. More generally, parents’ implicit theories of intelligence will determine at what ages they believe their children are ready to perform various cognitive tasks.” Here, behaviour with others is a kind of cognitive task. So, the answer is: B Question 2: a reference to lack of clarity over the definition of intelligence Keywords for the question: lack of clarity, definition of intelligence, The first of paragraph A has the answer for this question. Take a close look. “. .. . no one knows what it actually is. This chapter addresses how people conceptualize intelligence, whatever it may actually be.” Here, the lines suggest that our idea about the definition of intelligence will be clear reading this chapter. So, the answer is: A Question 3: the point that a researcher’s implicit and explicit theories may be very different Keywords for the question: researcher’s, implicit, explicit, theories, may be, different, The first lines of paragraph D indicate the answer. Here, the author states, “…implicit theories can be useful when an investigator suspects that existing explicit theories are wrong or misleading.” This means implicit theories may be right when explicit theories are wrong. So, the answer is: D Questions 4-6: In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claims of the writer – YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claims of the writer – NO It is impossible to say what the writer thinks about this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 4: Slow language development in children is likely to prove disappointing to their parents. Keywords for the question: slow language development, likely to prove, disappointing, We find the reference of ‘language development in children’ in paragraph B; but there is no mention of any slow or fast language learning. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 5: People’s expectations of what children should gain from education are universal. Keywords for the question: expectations, what children should gain, education, universal The answer lies in paragraph E. Take a look at lines 2-6, “. … . .people have expectations for intellectual performances that differ for children of different ages. How these expectations differ is part a function of culture. For example, expectations for children who participate in Western-style schooling are almost certain to be different from those for children who do not participate in such schooling.” Here, these lines indicate that expectations of what children should achieve, learn or gain for education are not universal; it differs for their age and the culture in which they are brought up.” So, the answer is: NO Question 6: Scholars may discuss theories without fully understanding each other. Keywords for the question: scholars, may discuss, without, understanding, The answer is in the last lines of paragraph J. In lines 4-6 the author says, “. .. … .Until scholars are able to discuss their implicit theories and thus their assumptions, they are likely to miss the point of what others are saying when discussing their explicit theories and their data.” So, it is noted here that scholars may consult with each other about the theories sometimes without fully understanding each other’s point. So, the answer is: YES Questions 7-13: (Matching statements with correct theory): (The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the keywords and read around different names of people or person (theory) carefully. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same person in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions may not follow any sequential order. ) Question 7: It is desirable for the same possibilities to be open to everyone. Keywords for the question: desirable, same possibilities, open to everyone, The answer in found in Section H, in the very opening line, “The Jeffersonian view is that people should have equal opportunities, …. ….” Here, people should have = desirable, equal opportunities = same opportunities, So, the answer is: B (Jeffersonian) Question 8: No section of society should have preferential treatment at the expense of another. Keywords for the question: no section, preferential treatment, expense of another, The last line of Section I has the answer. The author writes, “. .. In this view, we do not need or want any institutions that might lead to favouring one group over another.” Here, favouring one group over another = preferential treatment at the expense of another So, the answer is: C (Jacksonian) Question 9: People should only gain benefits on the basis of what they actually achieve. Keywords for the question: should, gain benefits, what they actually achieve, The answer is found at the end of section H. Take a look at this line, “. .. . . .to allow children the opportunities to make full use of the skills they have.” Here, allow children the opportunities = people should only gain benefits, skills they have = what they actually achieve, So, the answer is: B (Jeffersonian) Question 10: Variation in intelligence begins at birth. Keywords for the question: variation, intelligence, begins, birth, The answer can be traced in section G, in the very beginning. The writer says, “ . . .people are born with different levels of intelligence . .. . .” Here, different levels = variation So, the answer is: A (Hamiltonian) Question 11: The more intelligent people should be in positions of power. Keywords for the question: more intelligent people, positions of power, The answer for this question is found in lines 4-7 of Section G, “.. . seem to have shared this belief when they wrote about the emergence of a cognitive (high-IQ) elite, which eventually would have to take responsibility for the largely irresponsible masses of non-elite (low IQ) people who cannot take care of themselves.” Here, cognitive (high-IQ) elite = more intelligent people, eventually would have to take responsibility = should be in positions of power So, the answer is: A (Hamiltonian) Question 12: Everyone can develop the same abilities. Keywords for the question: everybody, develop, same abilities, The answer can be traced in the middle of Section I. “… . . people are essentially intersubstitutable except for specialized skills, all of which can be learned.” So, the answer is: C (Jacksonian) Question 13: People of low intelligence are likely to lead uncontrolled lives. Keywords for the question: low intelligence, likely to, lead, uncontrolled lives, The last few lines of Section G give us the answer. First the writer says in lines 6-7, “ . . .for the largely irresponsible masses of non-elite (low-IQ) people who cannot take care of themselves.” Then in the last lines the author mentions, “.. .Left to themselves, the unintelligent would create, as they always have created, a kind of chaos.” Here, chaos means disorder which is the result of irresponsible people’s lifestyle. So, the answer is: A (Hamiltonian) Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Saving bugs to find new drugs Questions 14-20 (Identifying information): [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 14: mention of factors driving a renewed interest in natural medicinal compounds Keywords for this question: factors, renewed interest, natural medicinal compounds The answer is found in the last lines of paragraph C. The writer mentions, “This realization, together with several looming health crises, such as antibiotic resistance, has put bioprospecting – the research for useful compounds in nature – firmly back on the map. Here, firmly back on the map = renewed interest Also, look at the phrase used in lines 2-3, “the development of new approaches focusing once again on natural products”. So, the answer is: C Question 15: how recent technological advances have made insect research easier Keywords for this question: recent technological advances, insect research, easier, The answer for this question is in paragraph H, lines 2-4. The author writes, “ . .. . Fortunately, it is now possible to snip out the stretches of the insect’s DNA that carry the codes for the interesting compounds and insert them into cell lines that allow larger quantities to be produced.” The lines indicate that the research has become easier fortunately due to technological advancements in DNA research. Here, “Fortunately, it is now possible” = recent technological advances So, the answer is: H Question 16: examples of animals which use medicinal substances from nature Keywords for this question: animals, use, medicinal substances, nature, The answer can be found at the very beginning of the passage in paragraph A. Take a close look and you will find the mention of primates like “capuchin monkeys who use toxin-oozing millipedes to deter mosquitoes” and “chimpanzees who use noxious forest plants to rid themselves of intestinal parasites”. So, the answer is: A Question 17: reasons why it is challenging to use insects in drug research Keywords for this question: reasons, challenging, use insects, drug research, Paragraph F talks about three prime reasons of the challenges associated with using insects in drug research (Look at the connectors used here like Firstly, Secondly and Thirdly). Also, the paragraph opens with a question about the little interest in bioprospecting, “Why is it that insects have received relatively little attention in bioprospecting?” So, the answer is: F Question 18: reference to how interest in drug research may benefit wildlife Keywords for this question: reasons, interest in drug research, benefit, wildlife, Paragraph I is mainly a message from Zoologist Ross Piper who is optimistic about drug research which can be advantageous for wildlife and its conservation. Take a look at lines 4-7, “. .. I sincerely believe that all species, however small and seemingly insignificant, have a right to exist for their own sake. If we can shine a light on the darker recesses of nature’s medicine cabinet, exploring the useful chemistry of the most diverse animals on the planet, I believe we can make people think differently about the value of nature.” These lines clearly shows the fact that higher research on drug research can benefit all species (wildlife). So, the answer is: I Question 19: a reason why nature-based medicines fell out of favour for a period Keywords for this question: reason, nature-based medicines, fell out of favour, In lines 3-6 of paragraph B give us the answer. The writer states here, “ . .. Then, for a while, modern pharmaceutical science moved its focus away from nature and into the laboratory, deigning chemical compounds from scratch. The main cause of this shift is that although there are plenty of promising chemical compounds in nature, finding them is far from easy.” So, the answer is: B Question 20: an example of an insect-derived medicine in use at the moment Keywords for this question: insect-derived medicine, in use, at the moment, The answer can be found in lines 2-4 of paragraph E. “. .. For example, alloferon, an antimicrobial compound produced by blow fly larvae, is used as an antiviral and antitumor agent in South Korea and Russia.” So, the answer is: E Questions 21 and 22: (Choosing the TWO best answers) [In this type of question, candidates are asked TWO best possible answers for one question. Candidates need to write the correct LETTERS for the answers. Here, the techniques for Multiple Choice Questions are applicable.] Question 21 22: Which TWO of the following make insects interesting for drug research? Keywords for these questions: TWO, make insects interesting, drug research, The answers are found in paragraph G and H. In paragraph G, the author writes in lines 3-4, “… . .. . The creatures that particularly interest us are the many insects that secrete powerful poison for subduing prey and keeping it fresh for future consumption.” So, the lines match with option B. In paragraph H, the author writes in lines 2-4, “. . .. Fortunately, it is now possible to snip out the stretches of the insect’s DNA that carry the codes for the interesting compounds and insert them into cell lines that allow larger quantities to be produced.” So, the lines match with option C. So, the answers are: 21. B (the variety of substances insects have developed to protect themselves) 22. C (the potential to extract and make use of insect’s genetic codes) Question 23-26: (Completing summary with ONE WORD ONLY): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to ONE WORD ONLY to complete a summary on the given topic. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word/words.] Title of the summary: Research at Aberystwyth University As the title of the summary is Aberystwyth University, we will find the answers in paragraph G. Question 23: Ross Piper and fellow zoologists at Aberystwyth University are using their expertise in ___________ when undertaking bioprospecting with insects. Keywords for this answer: Ross Piper and fellow zoologists, using their expertise, bioprospecting, insects, In paragraph G, look at the first lines, “My colleagues and I at Aberystwyth University in the UK have developed an approach in which we use our knowledge of ecology as a guide to target our efforts.”. Here, My colleagues and I = Ross Piper and fellow zoologists, our knowledge of = their expertise in, So, the answer is: ecology Question 24: They are especially interested in the compounds that insects produce to overpower and preserve their ___________. Keywords for this answer: compounds, insects produce, to overpower and preserve, The answer is in lines 3-4 of paragraph G, “The creatures that particularly interest us are the many insects that secrete powerful poison for subduing prey and keeping it fresh for future consumption.” Here, secrete powerful poison = compounds that insects produce, subduing = overpower, keeping it fresh = preserve, So, the answer is: prey Question 25: They are also interested in compounds which insects use to protect themselves from pathogenic bacteria and fungi found in their ___________. Keywords for this answer: compounds, insects use, to protect themselves, pathogenic bacteria and fungi, In lines 3-8 of paragraph G, the writer says, “ . .. There are even more insects that are masters of exploiting filthy habitats, such as faeces and carcasses, where they are regularly challenged by thousands of micro-organisms. These insects have many antimicrobial compounds for dealing with pathogenic bacteria and fungi, . ..” Here, for dealing with = to protect themselves from, The pathogenic bacteria and fungi are found in the filthy habitats. So, the answer is: habitats Question 26: Piper hopes that these substances will be useful in the development of drugs such as _________. Keywords for this answer: these substances, useful, development of drugs such as, The last lines of paragraph G say, “. .. .suggesting that there is certainly potential to find many compounds that can serve as or inspire new antibiotics.” Here, substances = compounds, in the development of = can serve or inspire, So, the answer is: antibiotics Reading Passage 3: The headline of the passage: The power of play N.B.: There are 11 paragraphs in this passage (After paragraph no. 6, there is a short description on a Scale of playfulness, which is attached to paragraph no. 6.). Questions 27-31 (Matching researchers with statements) (The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the name of the person and read around it carefully. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same person in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions may not follow any sequential order. ) Question 27: Play can be divided into a number of separate categories Keywords for this question: divided into, a number of, separate categories, The answer is in paragraph no. 4 in lines 2-3 where the author writes, “. .. . .Definitions range from discrete descriptions of various types of play such as physical, construction, language, or symbolic play (Miller Almon 2009). . ..”. So, the lines suggest that play can be divided into some categories like physical, construction, language, symbolic etc. So, the answer is: B (Miller Almon) Question 28: Adults’ intended goals affect how they play with children Keywords for this question: adult’s goals, affect, how, play with children, In paragraph no. 8, we can see the reference of adults’ goal. In lines 3-4 the author says, “. . .The adults’ role in play varies as a function of their educational goals and the child’s developmental level (Hirsch-Pasek et al. 2009).” Here, varies = affect So, the answer is: G (Hirsch-Pasek et al.) Question 29: Combining work with play may be the best way for children to learn Keywords for this question: combining work with play, best way, to learn, In paragraph no. 7 the writer mentions in lines 3-5, “. . .. Researcher Joan Goodman (1994) suggested that hybrid forms of work and play are not a detriment to learning; rather they can provide optimal contexts for learning.” So, the answer is: F (Joan Goodman) Question 30: Certain elements of play are more significant than others Keywords for this question: certain elements, more significant than others, Paragraph no. 6 gives us the answer. Here, the writer says, “Rubin and colleagues did not assign greater weight to any one dimension in determining playfulness; however, other researchers have suggested that process orientation and a lack of obvious functional purpose may be the most important aspects of play (e.g. Pellegrini 2009).” The lines suggest that though Rubin and his colleagues did not think that any one dimension (element) is not more significant than other, Pellegrini thought differently. So, the answer is: E (Pellegirni) Question 31: Activities can be classified on a scale of playfulness Keywords for this question: activities, classified, scale of playfulness, The answer is in paragraph no. 5 where the writer gives reference of the research conducted by Rubin and colleagues in 1983 (Rubin et.al. 1983), “Often, play is defined along a continnum as more or less playful using the following set of behavioral and dispositional criteria (e.g. Rubin et al. 1983):. . .” Then the wirter explains the scale of playfulness. So, the answer is: C (Rubin at al.) Questions 32-36: (YES/NO/NOT GIVEN): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN] [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 32: Children need toys in order to play. Keywords for this question: Children, toys, The very first lines of paragraph no. 1 give us the answer, “Virtually every child, the world over, plays. The drive to play is so intense that children will do so in any circumstances, for instance when they have no real toys, or when parents do not actively encourage the behaviour. In the eyes of a young child, running, pretending and building is fun.” The lines clearly suggest that children take running, pretending or building as play when they do not get a toy. So, the answer is: NO Question 33: It is a mistake to treat play and learning as separate types of activities. Keywords for this question: mistake, treat, play and learning, separate, activities, The answer is in the last line of paragraph no. 2. “Our society has created a false dichotomy between play and learning.” Here, false = mistake, dichotomy = separate, So, the answer is: YES Question 34: Play helps children to develop their artistic talents. Keywords for this question: helps, children, develop, artistic talents, As we have found the answer for question no. 33 at the end of paragraph no. 2 and the main keyword ‘definition’ for question no. 35 is found in paragraph no. 4, the answer for question no. 34 has to be found in paragraph no. 3 (This type of question maintains a sequence). There is no information about ‘artistic talents’ in this paragraph. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 35: Researchers have agreed on a definition of play. Keywords for this question: researchers, agreed, definition of play, In paragraph no. 4 we find the keyphrase ‘definition of play’. The first line gives us the answer, “Full consensus on a formal definition of play continues to elude the researchers and theorists who study it.” Here, elude = make confused and avoid, consensus = agreement, This means researchers are not in agreement on a definition of play. So, the answer is: NO Question 36: Work and play differ in terms of whether or not they have a target. Keywords for this question: work and play, differ, have a target, We find the reference of ‘work and play’ in paragraph no. 7. Here, in lines 2-3 the writer says, “. . .Unlike play, work is typically not viewed as enjoyable and it is extrinsically motivated (i.e. it is goal-oriented).” Here, goal-oriented = have a target, Thus, the line suggests that work is different from play because it is mainly based on a target. So, the answer is: YES Questions 37-40 (Completing summary with ONE WORD ONLY): [In this type of question, candidates are asked to ONE WORD ONLY to complete a summary on the given topic. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word/words.] Title of the summary: Guided play Question 37: In the simplest form of guided play, an adult contributes to the environment in which the child is playing. Alternatively, an adult can play with a child and develop the play, for instance by __________ the child to investigate different aspects of their game. Keywords for this question: Alternatively, adult, play with child, develop, for instance, investigate, The answer is found in paragraph no. 9 in lines 2-5, “. .. In the more direct form of guided play, parents or other adults can support children’s play by joining in the fun as a co-player, raising thoughtful questions, commenting on children’s discoveries, or encouraging further exploration or new facets to the child’s activity.” Here, further exploration means investigate So, the answer is: encouraging Question 38: Adults can help children to learn through play, and may make the activity rather structured, but it should still be based on the child’s __________ to play. Keywords for this question: adults, help children, learn, make, activity, structured, should still be, based on, The last lines of paragraph no. 9 have the answer. Here, the author writes, “. . . .Although playful learning can be somewhat structured, it must also be child-centered (Nicolopolou et al. 2006). Play should stem from the child’s own desire.” Here, stem from = based on, So, the answer is: desire Question 39 40: Play without the intervention of adults gives children real __________; with adults, play can be __________ at particular goals. However, all forms of play should be an opportunity for children to have fun. Keywords for this question: without, intervention of adults, with adults, particular goals, The answers are in the last paragraph. Here, in line no. 2 gives the answer for question no. 39. “Intrinsically motivated free play provides the child with true autonomy, …” Here, free play = play without the intervention, true = real, Again, in lines 2-3, we find the answer for question no. 40. “. ..while guided play is an avenue through which parents and educators can provide more targeted learning experiences.” Here, parents and educators = adults, learning experiences = particular goals, So, the answers are: 39. autonomy 40. targeted",

For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word.] Title: Ysabel Giraldo’s research Question 1: Focused on a total of _________ different age groups of ants, analysing Keywords for the question: focused, total, age groups, ants The answer is in paragraph no. 3 in the very beginning in lines 1-2, “In the lab, P. dentata worker ants typically live for around 140 days. Giraldo focused on ants at four age ranges: 20 to 22 days, 45 to 47 days, 95 to 97 days and 120 to 122 days.” So, the answer is: four / 4 Behaviour: Question 2: how well ants looked after their ___________ Keywords for the question: how well, ants, looked, after The answer is in the first line of paragraph no. 4, “Giraldo watched how well the ants took care of the young of the colony, .. . ..” Here, took care = looked after So, the answer is: young Question 3: their ability to locate ___________ using a scent trail Keywords for the question: ability, locate, using, scent trail, The answer is found in lines 2-3 of paragraph no. 4, “.. ..She compared how well 20-day-old and 95-day-old ants followed the telltale scent that the insects usually leave to mark a trail to food.” Here, mark = locate, how well = their ability, So, the answer is: food Question 4: the effect that _______ had on them Keywords for the question: effect, had on them, The answer can be found in lines 3-4 of paragraph no. 4, “She tested how ants responded to light . .. .” Here, how ants responded = the effect ..…. had on them So, the answer is: light Question 5: how _________ they attacked prey Keywords for the question: how, attacked, prey, The answer is in the last lines of paragraph no. 4, “.. ..And when it came to reacting to prey, the older ants attacked the poor fruit fly just as aggressively as the young ones did, .. ….” Here, attacked the poor fruit fly = attacked prey, So, the answer is: aggressively Brains: Question 6: comparison between age and the ___________ of dying cells in the brains of ants Keywords for the question: comparison, age and, dying cells, brains of ants, Paragraph no. 5 talks about the research on ants’ brains. Here, in lines 1-3, the author says, “Then Giraldo compared the brains of 20-day-old and 95-day-old ants, identifying any cells that were close to death. She saw no major differences with age, nor was there any difference in the location of the dying cells, .. ..” So, the comparison was between ants’ age and location. So, the answer is: location Question 7: condition of synaptic complexes (areas in which _______ meet) in the brain’s ‘mushroom bodies’ Keywords for the question: synaptic complexes, mushroom bodies, The answer is found in lines 4-6 of paragraph no. 5. The author says here, “Ants and other insects have structures in their brains called mushroom bodies, which are important for processing information, learning and memory. She also wanted to see if ageing affects the density of synaptic complexes within these structures – regions where neurons come together.” Here, synaptic complexes mean the region of ant’s brain where neurons come together or meet. So, the answer is: neurons Question 8: level of two ________ in the brain associated with ageing Keywords for the question: level of two, associated with ageing, The answer is in lines 7-9 where the author talks about two chemicals. “.. .What was more, the old ants didn’t experience any drop in the levels of either serotonin or dopamine – brain chemicals whose decline often coincides with ageing.” Here, serotonin and dopamine are the two chemicals, coincides with ageing = associated with ageing, So, the answer is: chemicals Questions 9-13: In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 9: Pheidole dentata ants are the only known animals which remain active for almost their whole lives. Keywords for the question: Pheidole dentata, only known animals, remain active, almost, whole lives, The answer lies in the first lines of paragraph no. 2, where the author mentions ‘naked mole rats’. “Naked mole rats can live for almost 30 years and stay fit for nearly their entire lives.” So, Pheidole dentata ants are not the only known animals which remain active for almost their whole lives. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 10: Ysabel Giraldo was the first person to study Pheidole dentata ants using precise data about the insects’ ages. Keywords for the question: first person, study, Pheidole dentata, using, precise data, ages, The answer is in paragraph no. 3 in lines 2-4, “. … . ..Unlike all previous studies, which only estimated how old the ants were, her work tracked the ants from the time the pupae became adults, so she knew their exact ages.” Unlike all previous studies means the research works done by previous scientists did not use data about insects’ age, and naturally Ysabel Giraldo was the first to do so. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 11: The ants in Giraldo’s experiments behaved as she had predicted that they would. Keywords for the question: ants in Giraldo’s experiments, behaved, predicted, they would, In paragraph no. 5, the answer lies in lines 6-7, “She also wanted to see if ageing affects the density of synaptic complexes within these structures – regions where neurons come together. Again, the answer was no.” Previously, in the same paragraph, lines 1-3 suggest that Giraldo wanted to identify any cells that were close to death but she saw no major differences with age. This means the experiments did not show results as she expected. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 12: The recent studies of bees used different methods of measuring age-related decline. Keywords for the question: recent studies, bees, different methods, measuring age-related decline, In paragraph no. 6 we can see the reference of ‘bees’. But we do not find clear information on whether the recent studies of bees used several methods of measuring age-related decline. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 13: Pheidole dentata ants kept in laboratory conditions tend to live longer lives. Keywords for the question: Pheidole dentata ants, kept in laboratory, live longer, The answer is in paragraph no. 7. In the first lines the writer states, “Out in the wild, the ants probably don’t live for a full 140 days thanks to predator, disease and just being in an environment that’s much harsher than the comforts of the lab.” These lines suggest that ants kept in laboratory conditions live longer than ants living in the wild. So, the answer is: TRUE Reading Passage 2: The headline of the passage: Why zoos are good Questions 14-17 (Identifying information): [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question 14: a reference to how quickly animal species can die out Keywords for this question: quickly, animal species, die out The first few lines of paragraph B give us the answer, “Colossal numbers of species are becoming extinct across the world, and many more are increasingly threatened and therefore risk extinction. Moreover, some of these collapses have been sudden, dramatic and unexpected.” So, the answer is: B Do you need Cambridge IELTS 14? Click here! Question 15: reasons why it is preferable to study animals in captivity rather than in the wild Keywords for this question: preferable, study animals, captivity, rather than, wild, Again, lines 3-4 of paragraph E give us the answer to this question. The author says, “Being able to undertake research on animals in zoos where there is less risk and fewer variables means real changes can be effected on wild populations.” Here, there is less risk and fewer variables = reasons why it is preferable So, the answer is: E Question 16: mention of two ways of learning about animals other than visiting them in zoos Keywords for this question: two ways of learning, animals, other than visiting zoo, The answer can be found in paragraph C. In lines 2-3, we find the first way, “… .. television documentaries are becoming ever more detailed and impressive,. .” whereas lines 3-4 give us the second way, “ . . .and many natural history specimens are on display in museums, . .. . .” So, the two ways are television documentaries and natural history specimens. So, the answer is: C Question 17: reasons why animals in zoos may be healthier than those in the wild Keywords for this question: animals in zoos, may be, healthier, In paragraph A, lines 3-4 indicate us the answer to this question. “ . .. Animals in good zoos get a varied and high-quality diet with all the supplements required, and any illnesses they might have will be treated.” So, the reasons are getting healthy diet and good treatment. So, the answer is: A Questions 18-22: In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 18: An animal is likely to live longer in a zoo than in the wild. Keywords for this question: likely to, live longer, zoo, than in the wild, The first lines of paragraph A says, “…. it is perfectly possible for many species of animals living in zoos or wildlife parks to have a quality of life as high as, or higher than, in the wild.” Here, a quality of life .. . . . higher than, in the wild = likely to live longer So, the answer is: TRUE Question 19: There are some species in zoos which can no longer be found in the wild. Keywords for this question: some species, zoos, no longer be found, wild, In paragraph B, look at line 6, “A good number of species only exist in captivity, . . .. .” Here, only exist in captivity means that the animals cannot be found in the wild any more. So, the answer is: TRUE Question 20: Improvements in the quality of TV wildlife documentaries have resulted in increased numbers of zoo visitors. Keywords for this question: improvements, quality of TV wildlife documentaries, resulted, increased, zoo visitors, We find the mention of ‘TV wildlife documentaries’ in paragraph C in lines 2-3, “While it is true that television documentaries are becoming ever more detailed and impressive, . .. ..” But we do not find any statement about the results of TV documentaries. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 21: Zoos have always excelled at transmitting information about animals to the public. Keywords for this question: zoos, always excelled, transmitting information, about animals, In paragraph D, in lines 1-3, the author mentions, “. . ..there is also the education that can take place in zoos through signs, talks and presentations which directly communicate information to visitors about the animals they are seeing and their place in the world. This was an area where zoos used to be lacking. .. ” The lines suggest that zoos have played a major part in transmitting information through signs, talks and presentations. But zoos had a lacking in it before. So, zoos did not always excel at transmitting information. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 22: Studying animals in zoos is less stressful for the animals than studying them in the wild. Keywords for this question: studying animals, in zoos, less stressful, than studying, the wild, Paragraph E talks about the role of zoos in research. But we do not find any information regarding stress in studying animals in the zoos or in the wild. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Questions 23-26: (Choosing the TWO best answers) [In this type of question, candidates are asked TWO best possible answers for one question. Candidates need to write the correct LETTERS for the answers. Here, the techniques for Multiple Choice Questions are applicable.] Question 23 24: Which TWO of the following are stated about zoo staff in the text? Keywords for these questions: TWO, zoo staff, In paragraph D, take a look at lines 5-7 carefully. “… .. Many zoos also work directly to educate conservation workers in other countries, or send their animal keepers abroad to contribute their knowledge and skills to those working in zoos and reserves, .. .. .” Here, to educate conservation workers = teach people, send their animal keepers abroad = travel to overseas locations, So, the answers are: B (Some travel to overseas locations to join teams in zoos.) D (Some teach people who are involved with conservation projects.) Question 25 26: Which TWO of these beliefs about zoos does the writer mention in the text? Keywords for these questions: TWO, beliefs, The answer lies in lines 3-6 of paragraph F. Here, the writer says, “. . .They are vital not just in terms of protecting animals, but as a means of learning about them to aid those still in the wild, as well as educating and informing the general population about these animals and their world so that they can assist or at least accept the need to be more environmentally conscious.” Here, protecting animals =raise animals which can later be released into the wild, more environmentally conscious = public awareness, Other options talk about children overcoming their fear (A), employment opportunities (C) and income generation (D), which cannot be found. So, the answers are: B (They can increase public awareness of environmental issues.) E (They can raise animals which can later be released into the wild.) Reading Passage 3: The passage is without a title; about Marine debris or Ocean trash Questions 27-33 (TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN) In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN [For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question 27: Rochman and her colleagues were the first people to research the problem of marine debris. Keywords for this question: first people, research, problem, marine debris, The answer can be found tracing lines 3-4 of paragraph no. 2. The writer says here, “… . Plenty of studies have sounded alarm bells about the state of marine debris; . .. ..” This means scientists before Chelsea Rochman and her team have already alarmed the world about the problems of marine debris. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 28: The creatures most in danger from ocean trash are certain seabirds. Keywords for this question: most in danger, ocean trash, certain seabirds, We find the mention of ‘seabirds’ in paragraph no. 3 in line no. 2 as an example of what a study on marine debris could show. But we cannot find any such information which shows us of the most affected creatures. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question 29: The studies Rochman has reviewed have already proved that populations of some birds will soon become extinct. Keywords for this question: studies, Rochman, already proved, populations, birds, will, soon, extinct, In lines 2-4 of paragraph no. 3, the author states, “…. . . For example, a study could show that certain seabirds eat plastic bags, and go on to warn that whole bird populations are at risk of dying out. ‘But the truth was that nobody had yet tested those perceived threats,’ Rochman says. ‘There wasn’t a lot of information’.” Here, the lines suggest that there wasn’t enough information to prove that populations of some birds would become extinct. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 30: Rochman analysed papers on the different kinds of danger caused by ocean trash. Keywords for this question: analysed, papers, danger, ocean trash, The answer lies in paragraph no. 4, “Rochman and her colleagues examined more than a hundred papers on the impacts of marine debris that were published through 2013. Within each paper, they asked what threats scientists had studied – 366 perceived threats in all.. .. . . .” These lines suggest that Rochman analysed 100+ papers on different angles of problems caused by ocean trash (marine debris). So, the answer is: TRUE Question 31: Most of the research analysed by Rochman and her colleagues was badly designed. Keywords for this question: most of, research, badly, designed, In paragraph no. 4, we have found that Rochman analysed 100+ papers. Then in paragraph no. 5 the writer states, “In 83 percent of cases, the perceived dangers of ocean trash were proven true. In the remaining cases, the working group found the studies had weaknesses in design and content which affected the validity of their conclusions – they lacked a control group, for example, or used faulty statistics.” These lines indicate that 83 cases out of 100+ cases proved to be correct. IN the remaining cases there were faults. So, the answer is: FALSE Question 32: One study examined by Rochman was expecting to find that mussels were harmed by eating plastic. Keywords for this question: expecting, find, mussels, harmed by eating plastic, The answer for this question can be found in paragraph no. 6 in the beginning. “Strikingly, Rochman says, only one well-designed study failed to find the effect it was looking for, an investigation of mussels ingesting microscopic plastic bits. The plastic moved from the mussels’ stomachs to their bloodstreams, scientists found, and stayed there for weeks – but didn’t seem to stress out the shellfish.” Here, the lines suggest that Rochman was hoping to find that mussels were getting affected by taking plastic but the study showed that it plastic did not stress (harm) the shellfish (mussels). So, the answer is: TRUE Question 33: Some mussels choose to eat plastic in preference to their natural diet. Keywords for this question: mussels, choose to eat, plastic, preference, natural diet, There is no such information which shows that some mussels take plastic as a choice of their regular food. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Questions 34-39: (Completing notes with ONE WORD ONLY) [In this type of question, candidates are asked to write only one word/ no more than two words to complete a note on the given topic. For this type of question, first, skim the passage to find the keywords in the paragraph concerned with the answer, and then scan to find the exact word.] Title: Findings related to marine debris Studies of marine debris found the biggest threats were: plastic (not metal or wood) Question 34: bits of debris that were __________ (harmful to animals) Keywords for this question: bits of debris, harmful to animals, We find the mention of ‘metal or wood’ and ‘animals’ in paragraph no. 8. Here, lines 2-3 says, “.. . Most of the dangers also involved large pieces of debris – animals getting entangled in trash, for example, or eating it and severely injuring themselves.” Here, bits of debris = pieces of debris, So, the answer is: large Question 35: There was little research into ___________ e.g. from synthetic fibres. Keywords for this question: little research, synthetic fibres, The answer is in paragraph no. 9 in the opening. “But a lot of ocean debris is ‘microplastic’, or pieces smaller than five millimeters. These may be ingredients used in cosmetics and toiletries, fibers shed by synthetic clothing in the wash, or eroded . .. . . . .. . .. . . . Rochman’s group found little research on the effects of these tiny bits.. . .” So, little research was done on microplastic. So, the answer is: microplastic Drawbacks of the studies examined: Question 36: most of them focused on individual animals, not entire ____________ Keywords for this question: most of, focused, individual animals, not entire, The answer is in lines 2-3 of paragraph no. 10. “.. . . . Many studies have looked at how plastic affects an individual animal, or that animal’s tissues or cells, rather than whole populations.” So, the answer is: populations Question 37: the __________ of plastic used in the lab did not always reflect those in the ocean Keywords for this question: plastic, used in the lab, did not, always, reflect, ocean, In lines 3-4 of paragraph no. 10, the writer mentions, “……. .And in the lab, scientists often use higher concentrations of plastic than what’s really in the ocean.” Here, did not always reflect those in the ocean = than what’s really in the ocean So, the answer is: concentrations there was insufficient information on numbers of animals which could be affected Question 38: the impact of a reduction in numbers on the __________ of that species Keywords for this question: reduction in numbers, species, In the last lines of paragraph no. 10, the author says, “. . .. – or how deaths in one species could affect that animal’s predators, or the rest of the ecosystem.” Here, deaths in one species = reduction in numbers So, the answer is: predators the impact on the ecosystem Question 39: Rochman says more information is needed on the possible impact of future __________ (e.g. involving oil) Keywords for this question: possible impact, future, involving oil, The first lines of paragraph no. 11 give us the answer. “ ‘We need to be asking more ecologically relevant questions,’ Rochman say, Usually, scientists don’t know exactly how disasters such as a tanker accidentally spilling its whole cargo of oil and polluting huge areas of the ocean will affect the environment until after they’ve happened. ” Here, affect = impact So, the answer is: disasters Question 40: Choosing the title [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable title for the whole passage from three or four options. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers for previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] What would be the best title for this passage? A. Assessing the threat of marine debris B. Marine debris: who is to blame? C. A new solution to the problem of marine debris D. Marine debris: the need for international action Here, we have to make decision on which title goes best with the passage. Our reading of the passage for the questions 27-39 clearly indicates that the passage is about the research and its results and further suggestions on evaluating or assessing the threats of ocean trash or marine debris. So, the answer is: A",

Keywords are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. However, we should not be surprised if the sequence is not maintained. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Title of the note: The nutmeg tree and fruit Question no. 1: the leaves of the tree are ________ in shape Keywords for the question: leaves, shape, For this question, we have to look at the first paragraph, as this paragraph describes the nutmeg tree and its fruit in detail. Let’s have a look. Lines 3-4 say, “ .. . . The tree is thickly branched with dense foliage of tough, dark green oval leaves, . .. .. .” This means the shape of the nutmeg tree leaves is oval. So, the answer is: oval Question no. 2: the ________ surrounds the fruit and breaks open when the fruit is ripe Keywords for the question: surrounds the fruit, breaks open, ripe, Lines 5-6 of paragraph no. 1 say, “ . .. . The fruit is encased in a fleshy husk. When the fruit is ripe, this husk splits into two halves along a ridge running the length of the fruit. . .. .” Here, encased in = surrounded by / covered in, splits into two halves = breaks open, So, the answer is: husk Question no. 3 4: the ________ is used to produce the spice nutmeg Keywords for the question: used to produce, spice nutmeg, the covering known as the aril is used to produce ________ Keywords for the question: covering, known as the aril, used to produce, The answers to these two questions can be found in the last few lines of paragraph no. 1. The writer of the passage says in lines 6-9, “ . .. . Inside is a purple-brown shiny seed, 2–3 cm long by about 2 cm across, surrounded by a lacy red or crimson covering called an ‘aril’. These are the sources of the two spices nutmeg and mace, the former being produced from the dried seed and the latter from the aril.” Here, the former indicates to seed, the latter indicates to mace. These lines suggest that the spice nutmeg is produced from the seed of the nutmeg tree. Also, the covering of the seed, which is known as ‘the aril’ is used to produce mace, which is another spice. So, the answers are: seed mace Questions 5-7: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUE The statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSE If there is no information on this – NOT GIVEN For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 5: In the Middle Ages, most Europeans knew where nutmeg was grown. Keywords for the question: Middle Ages, most Europeans, knew, where, nutmeg, grown, To find the answer to this question, we have to find the keyword ‘Middle Ages’. In the second paragraph, the first line contains the keyword ‘Middle Ages’. Let’s read there. “Nutmeg was a highly prized and costly ingredient in European cuisine in the Middle Ages, and was used as a flavouring, medicinal, and preservative agent. Throughout this period, the Arabs were the exclusive importers of the spice to Europe. They sold nutmeg for high prices to merchants based in Venice, but they never revealed the exact location of the source of this extremely valuable commodity. .. ..” The lines suggest that the Arabs were the exclusive exporters of nutmeg to Europe. But they never revealed, or, told anyone about the location of this spice tree. So, most Europeans knew nothing about the location of the nutmeg tree. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 6: The VOC was the world’s first major trading company. Keywords for the question: VOC, world’s first, major trading company, We find out about the VOC in paragraph no. 4. Here, the writer says, “In 1602, Dutch merchants founded the VOC, a trading corporation better known as the Dutch East India Company. By 1617, the VOC was the richest commercial operation in the world. The company had 50,000 employees worldwide, with a private army of 30,000 men and a fleet of 200 ships. . .. .” Here, the writer admits that by 1617, the VOC became the world’s richest commercially operating company. However, the paragraph contains no information on whether the VOC was the world’s first major trading company or not. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 7: Following the Treaty of Breda, the Dutch had control of all the islands where nutmeg grew. Keywords for the question: Following, Treaty of Breda, the Dutch, control, all the islands, nutmeg grew, We can find about the Treaty of Breda in paragraph no. 5. Have a close look at lines 11-17, “ . .. . After decades of fighting for control of this tiny island, the Dutch and British arrived at a compromise settlement, the Treaty of Breda, in 1667. Intent on securing their hold over every nutmeg-producing island, the Dutch offered a trade: if the British would give them the island of Run, they would in turn give Britain a distant and much less valuable island in North America. The British agreed. That other island was Manhattan, which is how New Amsterdam became New York. The Dutch now had a monopoly over the nutmeg trade which would last for another century.” Here, we can find out that the British Empire signed the Treaty of Breda in 1667 with the Dutch and gave away the island of Run to the Dutch. After the signing of the treaty, the Dutch gained complete control, or, monopoly business of nutmeg of all the islands where nutmeg grew. So, the answer is: TRUE Questions 8-13: Completing table: ONE WORD ONLY [In this type of question candidates need to fill in the gaps in a table with ONE WORD ONLY. Skimming and scanning, both reading skills are essential for this question-type.] Question no. 8: Middle Ages: Nutmeg was brought to Europe by the _______ Keywords for the question: Middle Ages, Nutmeg, brought to Europe, by, We’ve already looked at the information for question no. 5. Lines 1-3 of paragraph no. 2 says, “Nutmeg was a highly prized and costly ingredient in European cuisine in the Middle Ages, and was used as a flavouring, medicinal, and preservative agent. Throughout this period, the Arabs were the exclusive importers of the spice to Europe. .. .” Here, exclusive importers of the spice to Europe = the spice brought to Europe by, So, the answer is: Arabs Question no. 9: 17th Century: Demand for nutmeg grew, as it was believed to be effective against the disease known as the _________ Keywords for the question: 17th Century, Demand, grew, believed, effective against, disease, known as, Paragraph no. 4 begins with the year 1602, which indicates to the 17th Century. In paragraph no. 4, take a look at lines 4-6, “ . .. . At the same time, thousands of people across Europe were dying of the plague, a highly contagious and deadly disease. Doctors were desperate for a way to stop the spread of this disease, and they decided nutmeg held the cure. Everybody wanted nutmeg, and many were willing to spare no expense to have it. .. ..” Here, nutmeg held the cure = nutmeg was believed to be effective against plague. So, the name of the disease was the plague. So, the answer is: plague Question no. 10: 17th Century: The Dutch – put ________ on nutmeg to avoid it being cultivated outside the islands. Keywords for the question: 17th Century, the Dutch, put, on nutmeg, to avoid, being cultivated, outside the islands, In paragraph no. 5, let’s take a look at lines 7-9, “ . .. In addition, all exported nutmeg was covered with lime to make sure there was no chance a fertile seed which could be grown elsewhere would leave the islands. . .. .” Here, nutmeg was cover with lime = lime was put on nutmeg, make sure there was no chance a fertile seed which could be grown elsewhere = avoid it being cultivated outside the islands, This means the Dutch used to put lime on nutmeg to make the seed of nutmeg infertile so that the cultivation of nutmeg could be avoided elsewhere. So, the answer is: lime Question no. 11: 17th Century: The Dutch – finally obtained the island of _______ from the British. Keywords for the question: 17th Century, the Dutch, finally obtained, the island, from the British, At the end of paragraph no. 5, the writer says in lines 9-15, “… .. . There was only one obstacle to Dutch domination. One of the Banda Islands, a sliver of land called Run, only 3 km long by less than 1 km wide, was under the control of the British. After decades of fighting for control of this tiny island, the Dutch and British arrived at a compromise settlement, the Treaty of Breda, in 1667. Intent on securing their hold over every nutmeg-producing island, the Dutch offered a trade: if the British would give them the island of Run, they would in turn give Britain a distant and much less valuable island in North America. The British agreed.” Here, this account of history suggests that following the Treaty of Breda in 1667, the Dutch finally obtained the island of Run from the British. So, the answer is: Run Question no. 12: Late 18th Century: 1770 – nutmeg plants were secretly taken to _______ Keywords for the question: Late 18th Century, 1770, nutmeg plants, secretly taken to, The first lines on paragraph no. 6 give us the answer to this question. The writer of the passage says here, “Then, in 1770, a Frenchman named Pierre Poivre successfully smuggled nutmeg plants to safety in Mauritius, an island off the coast of Africa. .. ..” Here, smuggled = secretly taken, So, the answer is: Mauritius Question no. 13: Late 18th Century: 1778 – half the Banda Islands’ nutmeg plantations were destroyed by a ________. Keywords for the question: Late 18th Century, 1778, half, Banda Islands’ nutmeg plantations, destroyed by a, In paragraph no. 6, lines 3-4 say, “ . .. . Next, in 1778, a volcanic eruption in the Banda region caused a tsunami that wiped out half the nutmeg groves. .. ..” Here, wiped out = were destroyed, nutmeg groves = nutmeg plantations, So, the answer is: tsunami Reading Passage 2: Questions 14-26 The headline of the passage: Driverless cars Questions 14-19: Identifying information [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them first. It’s because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions of the passage first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question no. 14: reference to the amount of time when a car is not in use Keywords for the question: amount of time, car, not in use, The answer to this question can be found in line no. 3 of paragraph C. The author says here, “ .. . .. At present, the average car spends more than 90 percent of its life parked. . ..” Here, 90 percent of its life = amount of time, parked = car not in use, So, the answer is: C Question no. 15: mention of several advantages of driverless vehicles for individual road-users Keywords for the question: several advantages, driverless vehicles, individual road-users, Section B describes some advantages of driverless vehicles for the road-users. In the first paragraph of section B, the author says in lines 3-5, “ . . .. . more than 90 percent of road collisions involve human error as a contributory factor, and it is the primary cause in the vast majority. Automation may help to reduce the incidence of this.” Here, Automation = driverless vehicles, This means driverless vehicles can reduce road collisions, or, road accidents. Again, in the second paragraph of the same section, the author says in lines 1-4, “Another aim is to free the time people spend driving for other purposes. If the vehicle can do some or all of the driving, it may be possible to be productive, to socialise or simply to relax while automation systems have responsibility for safe control of the vehicle. . .. .” This means driverless vehicles can save time that people spend driving for other productive works, or, relaxation. So, the answer is: B Question no. 16: reference to the opportunity of choosing the most appropriate vehicle for each trip Keywords for the question: opportunity of choosing, most appropriate vehicle, each trip, The first paragraph of section E says, “Automation may prompt other changes in vehicle manufacture. If we move to a model where consumers are tending not to own a single vehicle but to purchase access to a range of vehicles through a mobility provider, drivers will have the freedom to select one that best suits their needs for a particular journey, rather than making a compromise across all their requirements.” The paragraph suggests that automation, or, driverless vehicles provide the opportunity to select appropriate vehicles for different trips. So, the answer is: E Question no. 17: an estimate of how long it will take to overcome a number of problems Keywords for the question: estimate, how long, take to overcome, a number of problems, The first two lines of section G give us the answer to this question. The author writes here, “It’s clear that there are many challenges that need to be addressed but, through robust and targeted research, these can most probably be conquered within the next 10 years. . . …” Here, many challenges = a number of problems, within the next 10 years = how long it will take to overcome, So, the answer is: G Question no. 18: a suggestion that the use of driverless cars may have no effect on the number of vehicles manufactured Keywords for the question: use of driverless cars, may have, no effect, number of vehicles, manufactured, The second paragraph of section D says, “Modelling work by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute suggests automated vehicles might reduce vehicle ownership by 43 percent, but that vehicle’s average annual mileage would double as a result. As a consequence, each vehicle would be used more intensively, and might need replacing sooner. This faster rate of turnover may mean that vehicle production will not necessarily decrease.” The paragraph, especially, the last lines, suggests that the use of automated vehicles, or, driverless cars may not affect the number of vehicles manufactured. So, the answer is: D Questions 19-22: Summary completion: [In this kind of question candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps.] Title of the summary: The impact of driverless cars Question no. 19: Figures from the Transport Research Laboratory indicate that most motor accidents are partly due to __________, so the introduction of driverless vehicles will result in greater safety. Keywords for the question: Figures, the Transport Research Laboratory, most motor accidents, partly due to, so, introduction of driverless vehicles, result in, greater safety, The answer can be found in Section B, in the first paragraph. Look at these lines carefully, “ . .. . One frequently cited motive is safety; indeed, research at the UK’s Transport Research Laboratory has demonstrated that more than 90 percent of road collisions involve human error as a contributory factor, . . .. . .” Here, more than 90 percent of road collisions = most motor accidents, So, the answer is: human error Question no. 20: In addition to the direct benefits of automation, it may bring other advantages. For example, schemes for __________ will be more workable, especially in towns and cities, resulting in fewer cars on the road. Keywords for the question: in addition to, direct benefits, automation, other advantages, schemes, will be, more workable, especially, towns and cities, resulting in, fewer cars on the road, The answer to this question can be found in section C. Here, in lines 3-7, the writer states, “ . .. . At present, the average car spends more than 90 percent of its life parked. Automation means that initiatives for car-sharing become much more viable, particularly in urban areas with significant travel demand. If a significant proportion of the population choose to use shared automated vehicles, mobility demand can be met by far fewer vehicles.” Here, initiatives = schemes, much more viable = more workable, particularly in urban areas = especially in towns and cities, far fewer vehicles = fewer cars on the road, So, the answer is: car sharing / car-sharing Question no. 21: According to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, there could be a 43 percent drop in _________ of cars. Keywords for the question: University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, could be, 43 percent drop, In section D, take a close look at paragraph no. 2. Here, the author of this passage writes in lines 1-2, “. .. Modelling work by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute suggests automated vehicles might reduce vehicle ownership by 43 percent, . .. . .” Here, reduce = drop, vehicle = car, So, the answer is: ownership Question no. 22: However, this would mean that the yearly ________ of each car would, on average, be twice as high as it currently is. This would lead to a higher turnover of vehicles, and therefore no reduction in automotive manufacturing. Keywords for the question: would mean, yearly, each car, on average, twice as high, would lead to, higher turnover, no reduction, automotive manufacturing, Line no. 3 of paragraph no. 2 in section D says, “ . . .. but that vehicles’ average annual mileage would double as a result. .. .” Here, but = however, annual = yearly, double = twice, So, the answer is: mileage Questions 23-26: Choosing TWO options from the given list [In this kind of question, candidates have to choose two or three answers for each question from five or six options. The answers will not follow any sequential order as they are randomly spread in the text, so this question will be time-consuming. Skimming will come handy and previous reading of the text can come in use. Therefore, other questions should be done first before answering this question.] Question no. 23 24: Which TWO benefits of automated vehicles does the writer mention? Keywords for the question: TWO benefits, automated vehicles, Section B of the passage talks in detail about the benefits of automation, or, driverless cars. Let’s have a look there again. In section B, let’s read the second paragraph. “Another aim is to free the time people spend driving for other purposes. If the vehicle can do some or all of the driving, it may be possible to be productive, to socialise or simply to relax while automation systems have responsibility for safe control of the vehicle. If the vehicle can do the driving, those who are challenged by existing mobility models – such as older or disabled travellers – may be able to enjoy significantly greater travel autonomy.” Here, it may be possible to be productive, to socialise or simply to relax while automation systems have responsibility for safe control of the vehicle = Travellers could spend journeys doing something other than driving, And, those who are challenged by existing mobility models – such as older or disabled travellers – may be able to enjoy significantly greater travel autonomy = People who find driving physically difficult could travel independently, So, the answers are: C (Travellers could spend journeys doing something other than driving.) D (People who find driving physically difficult could travel independently.) Question no. 25 26: Which TWO challenges to automated vehicle development does the writer mention? Keywords for the question: TWO challenges, automated vehicle development, Section F discusses the challenges of automated vehicle development. Let’s read the section. “There are a number of hurdles to overcome in delivering automated vehicles to our roads. These include the technical difficulties in ensuring that the vehicle works reliably in the infinite range of traffic, weather and road situations it might encounter, . .. . . . . . and the societal changes that may be required for communities to trust and accept automated vehicles as being a valuable part of the mobility landscape.” Here, hurdles = challenges, ensuring that the vehicle works reliably in the infinite range of traffic, weather and road situations it might encounter = getting automated vehicles to adapt to various different driving conditions, And, the societal changes that may be required for communities to trust and accept automated vehicles = making sure the general public has confidence in automated vehicles, So, the answers are: Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40 The headline of the passage: What is exploration? Questions 27-32: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question no. 27: The writer refers to visitors to New York to illustrate the point that – Keywords for the question: visitors to New York Take a look at the first lines of paragraph no. 1. The writer says, “ . .. Our desire to discover, and then share that new-found knowledge, is part of what makes us human – . .. ..” And, that’s the main idea of the first paragraph. Here, desire to discover = desire for exploration, part of what makes us human = intrinsic element of being human, Then, the writer provides reference to visitors of New York to illustrate the point in the last line of the paragraph, “ . .. and a visitor negotiate the subways of New York.” So, the answer is: A (exploration is an intrinsic element of being human.) Question no. 28: According to the second paragraph, what is the writer’s view of explorers? Keywords for the question: second paragraph, writer’s view of explorers, In the second paragraph, the writer says in the beginning, “Over the years, we’ve come to think of explorers as a peculiar breed – different from the rest of us, different from those of us who are merely ‘well travelled’, . . .. . a type of caveman more inclined to risk venturing out. .. .” These lines suggest that we, the general public, have had considered explorers are a different type of human beings, who want to take the risk to go on dangerous adventures. Then, in the next lines, the writer explains that this outlook about explorers is wrong and we all have the same urge. The writer says, “ . . . That, however, doesn’t take away from the fact that we all have this enquiring instinct, even today. . … ..” Here, we all have this enquiring instinct = an urge that is common to everyone, So, the answer is: C (They act on an urge that is common to everyone.) Question no. 29: The writer refers to a description of Egdon Heath to suggest that – Keywords for the question: Egdon Heath, We find the reference of Egdon Heath in paragraph no. 3. In the first few lines, the writer says, “Thomas Hardy set some of his novels in Egdon Heath, a fictional area of uncultivated land, and used the landscape to suggest the desires and fears of his characters. . . .” Here, desires and fears of his characters = people’s emotional states, This means it was Hardy’s aim to study the emotional states of the characters of his novels, setting a fictional area. So, the answer is: C (Hardy’s aim was to investigate people’s emotional states.) Question no. 30: In the fourth paragraph, the writer refers to ‘a golden age’ to suggest that – Keywords for the question: fourth paragraph, a golden age, Lines 2-5 of paragraph no. 4 say, “ . .. . . But that still left me with another problem: the word ‘explorer’ has become associated with a past era. We think back to a golden age, as if exploration peaked somehow in the 19th Century – as if the process of discovery is now on the decline, . . .. ..” Here, the phrase ‘as if’ has been used to signify that our thought about exploration (the process of discovery) being in decline is a wrong idea. So, the answer is: D (we are wrong to think that exploration is no longer necessary.) Question no. 31: In the sixth paragraph, when discussing the definition of exploration, the writer argues that – Keywords for the question: sixth paragraph, definition of exploration, writer argues, In the first few lines of paragraph no. 6, the writer says, “Each definition is slightly different – and tends to reflect the field of endeavour of each pioneer. It was the same whoever I asked: the prominent historian would say exploration was thing of the past, the cutting-edge scientist would say it was of present. And so on. They each set their own particular criteria; . . ..” Here, reflect the field of endeavour of each pioneer set their own particular criteria = relate exploration to their own professional interests, So, the answer is: A (people tend to relate exploration to their own professional interests.) Question no. 32: In the last paragraph, the writer explains that he is interested in – Keywords for the question: last paragraph, interested in, The writer expresses his interest in the last lines, “. . .. However, this is to disregard the role the human mind has in conveying remote places; and this is what interests me: how a fresh interpretation, even of a well-travelled route, can give its readers new insights.” Here, well-travelled route = places that may be familiar, So, the answer is: B (the human ability to cast new light on places that may be familiar.) Questions 33-37: Matching statements with list of people: [In this type of question, candidates need to relate statements that are given by or link to people in the passage. The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the name of the person and read around it carefully. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same person in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions may not follow any sequential order.] All the answers in this question set can be found in paragraph no. 2 and 5, as the names of explorers, have been included in this paragraph only. Question no. 33: He referred to the relevance of the form of transportation used. Keywords for the question: relevance, form of transportation used, The answer can be found in paragraph 5, in lines 7-9, “. . .. Wilfred Thesiger, who crossed Arabia’s empty quarters in 1946, and belongs to an era of unmechanised travel now lost to the rest of us, told me, “If I’d gone across by camel when I could have gone by car, it would have been a stunt.’. . .. .” Here, the explorer provides a reference to camel which was the form of transportation used. So, the answer is: E (Wilfred Thesiger) Question no. 34: He described feelings on coming back home after a long journey. Keywords for the question: feelings, coming back home, after, long journey, In paragraph no. 2, the writer says in lines 4-8, “ . .. . Explorer and travel writer Peter Fleming talks of the moment when the explorer returns to the existence he has left behind with his loved ones. The traveller ‘who has for weeks or months seen himself only as a puny and irrelevant alien crawling laboriously over a country in which he has no roots and no background, suddenly encounters his other self, a relatively solid figure, with a place in the minds of certain people.” Here, returns to the existence he has left behind with his loved ones = coming back home, for weeks or months = long journey, This means Peter Fleming refers to the feelings of an explorer coming back home after a long time. So, the answer is: A (Peter Fleming) Question no. 35: He worked for the benefit of specific groups of people. Keywords for the question: worked, benefit of specific group, In paragraph no. 5, read the lines 5-6, “ . … Then Robin Handbury-Tenison, a campaigner on behalf of remote so-called ‘tribal’ peoples, said, . . .. .” Here, on behalf of ….. ‘tribal people’ = done for another person’s benefit or support of ‘tribal’ people, So, the answer is: D (Robin Handbury-Tenison) Question no. 36: He did not consider learning about oneself an essential part of exploration. Keywords for the question: did not consider, learning about oneself, essential part of exploration, Lines 7-10 of paragraph no. 5 state, “ . . . Wilfred Thesiger, who crossed Arabia’s empty quarters in 1946, and belongs to an era of unmechanised travel now lost to the rest of us, told me, “If I’d gone across by camel when I could have gone by car, it would have been a stunt.’ To him, exploration meant bringing back information from a remote place regardless of any great self-discovery.” Here, regardless of any great self-discovery = did not consider learning about oneself, So, the answer is: E (Wilfred Thesiger) Question no. 37: He defined exploration as being both unique and of value to others. Keywords for the question: defined exploration, both, unique, of value to others, The answer lies in the first lines of paragraph no. 5. The writer states here, “ . .. . Ran Fiennes, dubbed the ‘greatest living explorer’, said, ‘An explorer is someone who has done something that no human has done before – and also done something scientifically useful. . . .” Here, something that no human has done before = unique, something scientifically useful = of value to others, So, the answer is: B (Ran Fiennes) Questions 38-40: Summary completion: [In this kind of question candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps.] Title of the summary: The writer’s own bias Question no. 38: The writer has experience of a large number of ______, .. . . . . Keywords for the question: the writer, experience, large number of, The final paragraph of this passage starts with this statement, “I’d best declare my own bias. . ..” So, the answers for questions 38-40 should be here. The writer says in lines 1-2, “ . .. . I’ve done a great many expeditions and each one was unique. .. ..” Here, a great many = a large number of, So, the answer is: (unique) expeditions Question no. 39: . .. . . and was the first stranger that certain previously ______ people had encountered. Keywords for the question: was, first stranger, certain, previously, people had encountered, In the final paragraph, look at lines 2-3, “ . .. I’ve lived for months alone with isolated groups of people all around the world, even two ‘uncontacted tribes’. . …” Here, the word ‘uncontacted’ gives us the hint that the writer was the first person ever contact with people of two tribes who remain isolated from the world. So, the answer is: uncontacted / isolated Question no. 40: He believes there is no need for further exploration of Earth’s ______, except to answer specific questions such as how buffalo eat. Keywords for the question: believes, no need, further exploration, Earth’s, Lines 7-8 of the final paragraph says, “ . .. .We know how the land surface of our planet lies; exploration of it is now down to the details – the habits of microbes, say, or the grazing behaviour of buffalo. . .” Here, We know how = there is no need for further exploration, So, the answer is: (land) surface",

That is not to suggest everyone should dance their way to work, however healthy and happy it might make us, … . .” Here, That is not to suggest = the writer is not proposing, healthy and happy it might make us = an appealing way, So, the answer is: B Question no. 2: an example of a contrast between past and present approaches to building Keywords for the question: example, contrast, past and present approaches, building, Lines 1-4 of paragraph C say, “Whereas medieval builders improvised and adapted construction through their intimate knowledge of materials and personal experience of the conditions on a site, building designs are now convinced and stored in media technologies that detach the designer from the physical and social realities they are creating. … . ..” Here, medieval = past builders, building designs are now = building designs of present time, The word ‘Whereas’ at the beginning of the sentence indicates that the writer is showing a comparison here. So, the answer is: C Question no. 3: mention of an objective of both dance and engineering Keywords for the question: an objective, both, dance, engineering, In lines 2-6 of paragraph F, the writer mentions, “ .. . . In order to bring about fundamental changes to the ways we use our cities, engineering will need to develop a richer understanding of why people move in certain ways, and how this movement affects them. Choreography may not seem an obvious choice for tackling this problem. Yet it shares with engineering the aim of designing patterns of movement within limitations of space. .. ..” Here, it shares with engineering = an objective of both dance and engineering, So, the answer is: F Question no. 4: reference to an unforeseen problem arising from ignoring the climate Keywords for the question: an unforeseen problem, arising from, ignoring the climate, Read the middle part of paragraph D. In lines 5-7, the writer states, “ . .. . They failed to take into account that purpose-build street cafés could not operate in the hot sun without the protective awnings common in older buildings, .. . .” Here, They failed to take into account = ignoring, purpose-build street cafés could not operate = unforeseen problem, the hot sun = the climate, So, the answer is: D Question no. 5: why some measures intended to help people are being reversed Keywords for the question: why, measures, intended to help people, reversed, In paragraph E, lines 1-4 say, “The same is true in transport engineering, which uses models to predict and shape the way people move through the city. Again, these models are necessary, but they are built on specific world views in which certain forms of efficiency and safety are considered and other experiences of the city ignored. Designs that seem logical in models appear counter-intuitive in the actual experience of their users. … ..” Here, appear counter-intuitive = appear to reverse, These lines clearly suggest that some measures which may seem logical in models may become illogical when appear in the actual experience. So, the answer is: E Question no. 6: reference to how transport has an impact on human lives Keywords for the question: how, transport has, impact, human lives, Lines 5-7 in paragraph A talks about the impact of transport in human lives. The writer says here, “. .. . The ways we travel affect our physical and mental health, our social lives, our access to work and culture, and the air we breathe. .. ..” Here, The ways we travel = transports, affect = has an impact, So, the answer is: A Questions 7-13: Summary completion [In this kind of question candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords form the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps.] Title of the summary: Guard rails The summary of the title indicates that we have to look for the answers in paragraph E. Question no. 7 8: Guard rails were introduced on British roads to improve the 7. _______ of pedestrians, while ensuring that the movement of 8. ______ is not disrupted. Keywords for the question: guard rails, introduced, British roads, improve, pedestrians, ensuring, movement of, not disrupted, In lines 5-7 of paragraph E, the author of the passage says, “ . . . The guard rails that will be familiar to anyone who has attempted to cross a British road, for example, we an engineering solution to pedestrian safety based on models that prioritise the smooth flow of traffic. . .. .” Here, solution = improve, smooth flow = movement . .. . not disrupted, So, the answers are: safety traffic Question no. 9: Pedestrians are led to access points, and encouraged to cross one ______ at a time. Keywords for the question: pedestrians, led to access points, encouraged, cross, one, at a time, In paragraph E, the author states in lines 8-10, “ . . . On wide major roads, they often guide pedestrians to specific crossing points and slow down their progress across the road by using staggered access points to divide the crossing into two – one for each carriageway. . . .” Here, they often guide pedestrians . .. . using staggered access points = pedestrians are led to access points, one for each carriageway = one carriageway at a time, So, the answer is: carriageway Question no. 10: An unintended effect is to create psychological difficulties in crossing the road, particularly for less _______ people. Keywords for the question: unintended effect, create, psychological difficulties, crossing the road, particularly, less, people, If we look at paragraph E, we can see that the writer says in lines 10-11, “. .. .. . In doing so they make crossings feel longer, introducing psychological barriers greatly impacting those that are the least mobile, . … . .” Here, they make crossings feel longer = An unintended effect, introducing = create, psychological barriers = psychological difficulties, the least = less, So, the answer is: mobile Question no. 11: Another result is that some people cross the road, in a ______ way. Keywords for the question: another result, some people, cross the road, way, Lines 11-12 of paragraph E say, “ . . . and encouraging others to make dangerous crossings to get around the guard rails. . .. .” Here, and = Another result, others = some people, crossings = cross the road, So, the answer is: dangerous Question no. 12: The guard rails separate _______, . .. . . Keywords for the question: guard rails, separate, In paragraph E, the writer says in lines 12-13, “ . .. These barriers don’t just make it harder to cross the road: they divide communities .. .. .” Here, These barriers = The guard rails, divide = separate, So, the answer is: communities Question no. 13: . . . .and make it more difficult to introduce forms of transport that are _______. Keywords for the question: make, more difficult, introduce, forms of transport, Lines 13-14 in paragraph E say, “. … and decrease opportunities for healthy transport, . .. .. .” Here, make it more difficult = decrease, opportunities = introduce, So, the answer is: healthy Reading Passage 2: Questions 14-27 The headline of the passage: Should we try to bring extinct species back to life? Questions 14-17: Identifying information [This question asks you to find information from the passage and write the number of the paragraph (A, B, C or D … .. ) in the answer sheet. Now, if the question is given in the very first part of the question set, I’d request you not to answer them. It’s mainly because this question will not follow any sequence, and so it will surely kill your time. Rather, you should answer all the other questions first. And just like List of Headings, only read the first two lines or last two lines of the expected paragraph initially. If you find the answers, you need not read the middle part. If you don’t find answers yet, you can skim the middle part of the paragraph. Keywords will be a useful matter here.] Question no. 14: a reference to how further disappearance of multiple species could be avoided Keywords for the question: how, further disappearance, multiple species, could be avoided, Look at the question again. It sounds like a solution to the problem of disappearing of multiple species. We should look at the last paragraph for the solution. Let’s read there. In paragraph F, in lines 5-8, the author explains the thoughts of Beth Shapiro, “ .. . . explains Shapiro. She prefers to focus the debate on how this emerging technology could be used to fully understand why various species went extinct in the first place, and therefore how we could use it to make genetic modifications which could prevent mass extinctions in the future. … .” Here, make genetic modifications which could prevent mass extinctions in the future = how further disappearance of multiple species could be avoided, So, the answer is: F Question no. 15: explanation of a way of reproducing an extinct animal using the DNA of only that species Keywords for the question: way of reproducing, an extinct animal, using, DNA, only that species, In paragraph A, the author talks about the passenger pigeon which have become extinct recently. Then, the author states in lines 5-10, “ . .. . Geneticist Ben Novak is lead researcher on an ambitious project which now aims to bring the bird back to life through a process known as ‘de-extinction’. The basic premise involves using cloning technology to turn the DNA of extinct animals into a fertilised embryo, which is carried by the nearest relative still in existence – in this case, the abundant band-tailed pigeon – before being born as a living, breathing animal. .. .. .” Here, we find a clear explanation of how Ben Novak is leading research to bring back the passenger pigeon to life again using cloning technology on a relative species, the band-tailed pigeon. So, the answer is: A Question no. 16: reference to a habitat which has suffered following the extinction of a species Keywords for the question: habitat, suffered, following, extinction of a species, The answer to this question can be found in lines 6-11 in paragraph D, “ . .. Since the disappearance of this key species, ecosystem in the eastern US have suffered, as the lack of disturbance caused by thousands of passenger pigeons wrecking trees and branches means there has been minimal need for regrowth. This has left forests stagnant and therefore unwelcoming to the plants and animals which evolved to help regenerate the forest after a disturbance. . .. .” Here, this key species = passenger pigeons, stagnant = inactive, So, the answer is: D Question no. 17: mention of the exact point at which a particular species became extinct Keywords for the question: the exact point, a particular species, became extinct, Lines 3-5 of paragraph A say, “ . .. . Sadly, the passenger pigeon’s existence came to an end on 1 September 1914, when the last living specimen died at Cincinnati Zoo. . ..” Here, 1 September 1914= the exact point, the last living specimen died = a particular species became extinct, So, the answer is: A Questions 18-22: Summary completion [In this kind of question candidates are given a summary for one, two or three paragraphs with some fill in the blanks questions. Candidates need to find out the related paragraphs by correctly studying the keywords from the questions. Then, they should follow the steps of finding answers for fill in the gaps.] Title of the summary: The woolly mammoth revival project The title of the summary tells us that the answers to this question type can be found in Paragraph E. Question no. 18: Professor George Church and his team are trying to identify the __________ which enabled mammoths to live in the tundra. The findings could help preserve the mammoth’s close relative, the endangered Asian elephant. Keywords for the question: Professor George Church and his team, trying to identify, enabled mammoths, live in the tundra, In paragraph E, take a look at lines 2-7, where the writer says, “ . . . George Church, professor at Harvard Medical School and leader of the Woolly Mammoth Revival Project, has been focusing on cold resistance, the main way in which the extinct woolly mammoth and its nearest living relative, the Asian elephant, differ. By pinpointing which genetic traits made it possible for mammoths to survive the icy climate of the tundra, the project’s goal is to return mammoths, or a mammoth-like species to the area. .. . .” Here, pinpointing = identifying, So, these lines indicate that by identifying the genetic traits of the mammoths which lived in the tundra, it might be possible to bring them or, a mammoth-like species back to the area. So, the answer is: genetic traits Question no. 19: According to Church, introducing Asian elephants to the tundra would involve certain physical adaptations to minimise _________ . Keywords for the question: According to Church, introducing Asian elephants, the tundra, would involve, certain physical adaptations, minimise, Questions no. 20 21: To survive in the tundra, the species would need to have the mammoth-like features of thicker hair, 20. ________ of a reduced size and more 21. ________. Keywords for the question: to survive, tundra, the species, would need, mammoth-like features, thicker hair, of reduced size, more, In paragraph E, lines 9-11 provide us the answers to these three questions. Let’s read the lines, “ . . . Necessary adaptations would include smaller ears, thicker hair, and extra insulating fat, all for the purpose of reducing heat loss in the tundra, and all the traits found in the now-extinct woolly mammoth. . ..”. Here, Necessary adaptations = To survive in the tundra, the species would need to have the mammoth-like features, reducing = minimise, So, the answer to question 19 is: heat loss Again, smaller = of a reduced size, So, the answer to question 20 is: ears And, extra = more, So, the answer to question 21 is: (insulating) fat Question no. 22: Repopulating the tundra with mammoths or Asian elephant/mammoth hybrids would also have an impact on the environment, which could help to reduce temperatures and decrease _________. Keywords for the question: Repopulating the tundra, mammoths or Asian elephant/mammoth hybrids, impact, environment, could help, reduce temperatures, decrease, The last few lines of paragraph E give us the answer to this question. The writer says here, “ . . . . This repopulation of the tundra and boreal forests of Eurasia and North America with large mammals could also be a useful factor in reducing carbon emissions – elephants punch holes through snow and knock down trees, which encourages grass growth. This grass growth would reduce temperatures, and mitigate emissions from melting permafrost.” Here, This repopulation of the tundra = Repopulating the tundra, reducing/mitigate = decrease, So, the answer is: (carbon) emissions Questions 23-26: Matching statements with list of people: [In this type of question, candidates need to relate statements that are given by or link to people in the passage. The rules for finding answers to this sort of question are simple. Just find the name of the person and read around it carefully. Then, give a quick look to check whether there is another statement or idea provided by the same person in the text. If there is, check the reference carefully and decide your answer. Remember, the questions may not follow any sequential order.] Question no. 23: Reintroducing an extinct species to its original habitat could improve the health of a particular species living there. Keywords for the question: Reintroducing an extinct species, its original habitat, could improve, health, particular species, living there, The answer can be found in lines 4-11 of paragraph B. Here, we find comments made by Michael Archer, “ .. . . . explains Michael Archer, of the University of New South Wales. He points out that in the decades since the thylacine went extinct, there has been a spread in a ‘dangerously debilitating’ facial tumour syndrome which threatens the existence of the Tasmanian devils, the island’s other notorious resident. Thylacines would have prevented this spread because they would have killed significant numbers of Tasmanian devils. . . .. . The return of thylacines to Tasmania could help to ensure that devils are never again subjected to risks of this kind.” Here, thylacine = Tasmanian Tiger (explained in the first line of paragraph B), The return of thylacines = reintroducing an extinct species, Tasmania = its original habitat, Thylacines would have prevented this spread = improve the health of Tasmanian devils (a particular species), So, the answer is: B (Michael Archer) Question no. 24: It is important to concentrate on the causes of an animal’s extinction. Keywords for the question: important to concentrate, causes, an animal’s extinction, The answer can be found in paragraph F. In this paragraph, the writer says in lines 5-8, “. . .. explains Shapiro. She prefers to focus the debate on how this emerging technology could be used to fully understand why various species went extinct in the first place. .. .. .” Here, focus the debate on = concentrate on, why various species went extinct = the causes of an animal’s extinction, So, the answer is: C (Beth Shapiro) Question no. 25: A species brought back from extinction could have an important beneficial impact on the vegetation of its habitat. Keywords for the question: a species, brought back from extinction, important beneficial impact, vegetation, its habitat, Take a look at the last half of paragraph D. The author of the passage says here, “ . . .. Since the disappearance of this key species, ecosystems in the eastern US have suffered, as the lack of disturbance caused by thousands of passenger pigeons wrecking trees and branches means there has been minimal need for regrowth. This had left forests stagnant and therefore unwelcoming to the plants and animals which evolved to help regenerate the forest after a disturbance. According to Novak, a hybridized band-tailed pigeon, with the added nesting habits of a passenger pigeon, could, in theory, re-establish that forest disturbance, . . .. . .” Here, hybridized band-tailed pigeon = A species brought back from extinction, plants = vegetation, Here, in these lines, Ben Novak suggests that due to the disturbance created in the forests by the extinct species, plants usually used to grow better. Now, as many species have gone extinct, there is no need of regrowth of trees and branches, and so, the forests have become stagnant or inactive. If there is a chance of bringing back the passenger pigeon (through its hybrid version of band-tailed pigeon), that lost forest disturbance could return, which means that it will have an impact on the plants (vegetations) and animals. So, the answer is: A (Ben Novak) Question no. 26: Our current efforts at preserving biodiversity are insufficient. Keywords for the question: current efforts, preserving biodiversity, insufficient, First, take a look at the phrase ‘bringing extinct animals back’ in the first line of paragraph F, which is synonymous to ‘preserving biodiversity’. The very last lines of the final paragraph (paragraph F) gives us the answer to this question. The author gives reference to the comments made by Beth Shapiro, “ . . . . ‘We know that what we are doing today is not enough, and we have to be willing to take some calculated and measured risks.’ ” Here, we are doing today = our current efforts, not enough = insufficient, So, the answer is: C (Beth Shapiro) Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40 The headline of the passage: Having a laugh Questions 27-31: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage. Generally, this question is found as the last question so you should not worry much about it. Finding all the answers to previous questions gives you a good idea about the title.] Question no. 27: When referring to laughter in the first paragraph, the writer emphasises – Keywords for the question: laughter, first paragraph, emphasises, In the first paragraph, take a close look at lines 3-5, “ . .. .. Like other human emotions and expressions, laughter and humour provide psychological scientists with rich resources for studying human psychology, ranging from the development of language to the neuroscience of social perception.” Here, laughter and humour provide psychological scientists with rich resources = the value of laughter in scientific research, So, the answer is: C (its value to scientific research.) Question no. 28: What does the writer suggest about Charley Douglass? Keywords for the question: suggest about, Charley Douglass, Paragraph no. 2 highlights what sound engineer Charley Douglass found while recording laughter. Take a look at lines 2-5, “ . .. . Back in 1950, US sound engineer Charley Douglass hated dealing with the unpredictable laughter of live audiences, so started recording his own ‘laugh tracks’. These were intended to help people at home feel like they were in a social situation, such as a crowded theatre. . .. .” Here, These were intended to help = the sound engineer understood the importance, people at home feel like they were in a social situation = enjoying humour in a group setting, So, the answer is: A (He understood the importance of enjoying humour in a group setting.) Question no. 29: What makes the Santa Cruz study particularly significant? Keywords for the question: the Santa Cruz study, particularly significant, The answer can be found in the very last lines of paragraph no. 3 where the author presents the results or findings of the Santa Cruz Study. The author says in lines 3-7, “. .. . then played these recordings to listeners from 24 diverse societies, . .. . .. . On average, the results were remarkably consistent: worldwide, people’s guesses were correct approximately 60% of the time.” Here, 24 diverse societies = wide range of cultures, results were remarkably consistent = similar results, So, the answer is: B (the similar results produced by a wide range of cultures.) Question no. 30: Which of the following happened in the San Diego study? Keywords for the question: happened, San Diego study, The answer is in paragraph no. 4. Read lines 8-9 where the writer explains what the participants did, “ . .. . Laughter was recorded as each student took a turn at being by the others, involving the use of mildly insulting nicknames. . . .” Here, each student took a turn at being by the others = participants exchanged roles, So, the answer is: B (Participants exchanged roles.) Question no. 31: In the fifth paragraph, what did the results of the San Diego study suggest? Keywords for the question: fifth paragraph, results, the San Diego study, suggest, The writer explains the results of the San Diego study in paragraph no. 5, in lines 5-9, “ .. . . Thus, by strategically displaying more dominant laughter when the context allows, low-status individuals may achieve higher status in the eyes of others.’ However, high-status individuals were rated as high-status whether they produced their natural dominant laugh or tried to do a submissive one.” Here, high-status individuals were rated as high-status whether they produced their natural dominant laugh or tried to do a submissive one = High-status individuals can always be identified by their way of laughing, So, the answer is: D (High-status individuals can always be identified by their way of laughing.) Questions 32-36: Completing summary with list of words [In this type of question, candidates are asked to complete a summary with a list of words taken from the passage. Candidates must write the correct letter (not the words) as the answers. Keywords and synonyms are important to find answers correctly. Generally, this type of question maintains a sequence. Find the keywords in the passage and you are most likely to find the answers.] Title of the summary: The benefits of humour Question no. 32: In one study at Australian National University, randomly chosen group of participants were shown one of three videos, each designed to generate a different kind of __________. Keywords for the question: study at Australian National University, randomly chosen, group of participants, shown, one of three videos, each designed, generate, different kind of, Let’s read the sixth paragraph to find this answer as this particular paragraph talks to the study at Australian National University. Here, in this paragraph, lines 6-8 say, “ . .. The students then were randomly assigned to watch a video clip eliciting either humour, contentment, or neutral feelings. Some watched a clip of the BBC comedy Mr. Bean, others a relaxing scene with dolphins swimming in the ocean, and others a factual video about the management profession.” Here, Some watched a clip of the BBC comedy Mr. Bean, others a relaxing scene with dolphins swimming in the ocean, and others a factual video about the management profession = participants were shown one of three videos, either humour, contentment, or neutral feelings = emotion, So, the answer is: F (emotion) Question no. 33: When aasll participants were then given a deliberately frustrating task to do, it was found that those who had watched the _________ video persisted with the task for longer and tried harder to accomplish the task than either of the other two groups. Keywords for the question: all participants, deliberately frustrating task, found, those, watched, persisted with the task, longer, tried harder, accomplish, either of, the other two groups, The answer can be traced in paragraph no. 7, “The students then completed a task requiring persistence in which they were asked to guess the potential performance of employees based on provided profiles, and were told that making 10 correct assessments in a row would lead to a win. However, the software was programmed such that it was nearly impossible to achieve 10 consecutive correct answers. Participants were allowed to quit the task at any point. Students who had watched the Mr. Bean video ended up spending significantly more time working on the task, making twice as many predictions as the other two groups.” Here, a task requiring persistence = a deliberately frustrating task (as the task requires perseverance), Mr. Bean video = amusing video, ended up spending significantly more time working = persisted with the task for longer, making twice as many predictions as the other two groups = tried harder to accomplish the task than either of the other two groups, So, the answer is: H (amusing) Question no. 34: A second study in which participants were asked to perform a particularly ________ task produced similar results. Keywords for the question: second study, participants, asked to perform, particularly, task, produced, similar results, In paragraph no. 8, the author mentions the second study. The author says here, “Cheng and Wang then replicated these results in a second study, during which they had participants complete long multiplication questions by hand. Again, participants who watched the humorous video spent significantly more time working on this tedious task and completed more questions correctly than did the students in either of the other groups.” Here, participants complete long multiplication questions by hand = participants were asked to perform a particularly boring task, tedious task boring task, participants who watched the humorous video . .. . .. completed more questions correctly = produced similar results, So, the answer is: C (boring) Questions no. 35 36: According to researchers David Cheng and Lu Wang, these findings suggest that humour not only reduces 35. ________ and helps build social connections but it may also have a 36. ________ effect on the body and mind. Keywords for the question: David Cheng, Lu Wang, humour, reduces, helps build, social connections, may also have, effect, body and mind, The answers to the questions can be found in the final paragraph where we can find the comments made by Cheng and Wang. Take a close look here at lines 1-2, “ ‘Although humour has been found to help relieve stress and facilitate social relationships, .. . . ..” Here, relieve = reduces, stress = anxiety, facilitate social relationships = helps build social connections, Then, read the last lines, “ . . . We suggest that humour is not only enjoyable but more importantly, energizing.” Here, energizing = may also have a stimulating effect on the body and mind, So, the answers are: D (anxiety) E (stimulating) Questions 37-40: YES, NO, NOT GIVEN [In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether: The statement in the question matches with the claim of the writer in the text- YES The statement in the question contradicts with the claim of the writer in the text- NO The statement in the question has no clear connection with the account in the text- NOT GIVEN] [TIPS: For this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 37: Participants in the Santa Cruz study were more accurate at identifying the laughs of friends than those of strangers. Keywords for the question: Participants in the Santa Cruz study, more accurate, identifying, laughs of friends, than, strangers, We have found the discussion on the Santa Cruz study in paragraph no. 3. In this paragraph, take a look at lines 5-7, “. … Participants were asked whether they thought the people laughing were friends or strangers. On average, the results were remarkably consistent: worldwide, people’s guesses were correct approximately 60% of the time.” Here, the lines don’t clarify where the participants were accurate (whether they identified more laughs of friends or of strangers). The results of the study just show that the participants were accurate by 60%. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 38: The researchers in the San Diego study were correct in their predictions regarding the behaviour of the high-status individuals. Keywords for the question: researchers, San Diego study, correct, predictions, behaviour, high-status individuals, In lines 9-11 of paragraph no. 4, the writer talks about the predicted results of San Diego study, “ .. . Analysis revealed that, as expected, high-status individuals produced more dominant laughs and fewer submissive laughs relative to the low-status individuals. . .. .” Here, as expected = as predicted, This means the researchers were correct in their predictions about high-status individuals. So, the answer is: YES Question no. 39: The participants in the Australian National University study were given a fixed amount of time to complete the task focusing on employee profiles. Keywords for the question: participants, Australian National University study, given, fixed amount of time, complete the task, focusing on, employee profiles, We find about the task focusing on employee profiles in the Australian National University study in paragraph no. 7. Take a look at lines 4-5 here, “ . .. Participants were allowed to quit the task at any point. . .. .” This means that there was no fixed time to complete the task. So, the answer is: NO Question no. 40: Cheng and Wang’s conclusions were in line with established notions regarding task performance.

Keywords for the question: leaving school, Moore did, his father wanted, In paragraph no. 1, take a look at lines 4-5, “ .. . . After leaving school, Moore hoped to become a sculptor, but instead, he complied with his father’s wish that he train as a schoolteacher. . . .” Here, After leaving school = On leaving school, he complied with his father’s wish = Moore did what his father wanted him to do, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 2: Moore began studying sculpture in his first term at the Leeds School of Art. Keywords for the question: began studying sculpture, first term, the Leeds School of Art, The answer is found in the first two lines of paragraph no. 2. The author says here, “After the war, Moore enrolled at the Leeds School of Art, where he studied for two years. In his first year, he spent most of his time drawing. . .” This means Moore didn’t study sculpture in his first year at the Leeds School of Art; he studied drawing. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 3: When Moore started at the Royal College of Art, its reputation for teaching sculpture was excellent. Keywords for the question: Royal College of Art, its reputation, teaching sculpture, excellent, Paragraph no. 2 and 3 talk about the time Moore studied at the Royal College of Art. However, there is no mention of the College’s reputation for teaching sculpture. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 4: Moore became aware of ancient sculpture as a result of visiting London museums. Keywords for the question: became aware, ancient sculpture, visiting London museums, The answer is found in paragraph no. 3. The writer says in lines 1-3, “Alongside the instruction he received at the Royal College, Moore visited many of London museums, particularly the British Museum, which had a wide-ranging collection of ancient sculpture. During these visits, he discovered the power and beauty of ancient Egyptian and African sculpture. . . .” Here, he discovered the power and beauty of ancient Egyptian and African sculpture = Moore became aware of ancient sculpture, So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 5: The Trocadero Museum’s Mayan sculpture attracted a lot of public interest. Keywords for the question: Trocadero Museum’s, Mayan sculpture, attracted, a lot of, public interest, Again, paragraph no. 4 talks about the Trocadero Museum’s Mayan sculpture, but it doesn’t mention anything about public interest. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 6: Moore thought the Mayan sculpture was similar in certain respects to other stone sculpture. Keywords for the question: Moore thought, Mayan sculpture, similar, certain respects, other stone sculpture, In paragraph no. 4, lines 4-5 say, “ .. . . Moore became fascinated with this stone sculpture, which he thought had a power and originality that no other stone sculpture possessed. . .. .” Here, no other stone sculpture possessed = the Mayan sculpture was NOT similar in certain respects to other stone sculpture, So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 7: The artists who belonged to Unit One wanted to make modern art and architecture more popular. Keywords for the question: the artists, belonged to Unit One, wanted, make modern art, architecture, more popular, The answer to this question can be found in paragraph no. 5. Here, the writer says in lines 2-4, “ . .. he became a member of a group of young artists called Unit One. The aim of the group was to convince the English public of the merits of the emerging international movement in modern art and architecture.” The lines suggest the aim of Unit One was to make modern art and architecture more popular.

Keywords for the question: Whaley, needs, co-operation of farmers, help preserve, wildlife, profit, In paragraph no. 7, lines 1-3 explain how wildlife like mammals and birds are being threatened by larger farms. Then, the writer says in lines 4-5, “ . .. In the hope of counteracting this, he’s persuading farmers to let him plant forest corridors on their land. …” Here, In the hope of counteracting this, he’s persuading farmers means Whaley needs the co-operation of the local farmers to preserve the area’s wildlife. So, the answer is: TRUE Question no. 13: Whaley has plans to go to Africa to set up a similar project. Keywords for the question: Whaley, plans, go to Africa, to set up, similar project, In the final paragraph (paragraph no. 8), lines 6-8 say, “. . . ‘If we can do it here, in the most fragile system on Earth, then that’s a real message of hope for lots of places, including Africa, where there is drought and they just can’t afford to wait for rain.” Here, the lines suggest that Whaley project can bring hope to different parts of the world like Africa where drought is a big problem. However, here we find no information about whether Whaley plans to go to Africa to set up another project like this one. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN The headline of the passage: Silbo Gomero – the whistle ‘language’ of the Canary Islands Questions 14-19: TRUE, FALSE, NOT GIVEN[In this type of question, candidates are asked to find out whether:The statement in the question agrees with the information in the passage – TRUEThe statement in the question contradicts with the information in the passage – FALSEIf there is no information on this – NOT GIVENFor this type of question, you can divide each statement into three independent pieces and make your way through with the answer.] Question no. 14: La Gomera is the most mountainous of all the Canary Islands. Keywords for the question: La Gomera, most mountainous, all the Canary Islands, In the first paragraph, the author of the text says in the beginning, “La Gomera is one of the Canary Islands situated in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of Africa. This small volcanic island is mountainous, with steep rocky slopes and deep, wooded ravines, rising to 1,487 metres at its highest peak. .. .” Here, we find the word mountainous; however, there is no comparison with other islands. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 15: Silbo is only appropriate for short and simple messages. Keywords for the question: Silbo, only appropriate, short, simple messages, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 5. Here, take a look at lines 4-5, “ .. .. ‘In daily life they use whistles to communicate short commands, but any Spanish sentence could be whistled.’.. .. .” Here, the lines suggest that Silbo is not only appropriate for short messages but also for long Spanish sentences. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 16: In the brain-activity study, silbadores and non-whistlers produced different results. Keywords for the question: brain-activity study, silbadores and non-whistlers, produced, different results, The answer can be found in lines 2-7 of paragraph no. 6, where the results of the experiments on brain-activity in silbadores and non-whistlers have been shown. Here, the author says, “ . . . Results showed the left temporal lobe of the brain, which is usually associated with spoken language, was engaged during the processing of Silbo. . . .. . . . . When the experiments were repeated with non-whistlers, however, activation was observed in all areas of the brain.” Here, the lines suggest that results were different for silbadores and non-whistlers. So, the answer is: TRUE Questions no. 17: The Spanish introduced Silbo to the islands in the 15th Century. Keywords for the question: The Spanish, introduced Silbo, 15th Century, The answer can be found in paragraph no. 8. In the first few lines, the writer says, “Carreiras says the origins of Silbo Gomero remain obscure, but that indigenous Canary Islanders, who were of North African origin, already had a whistled language when Spain conquered the volcanic islands on the 15th Century. .. . .” Here, these lines suggest that when the Spanish arrived in the Canary Islands to conquer, a whistled language had already been used by the islanders. This means the Spanish did not introduce Silbo to the islands. So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 18: There is precise data available regarding all of the whistle languages in existence today. Keywords for the question: precise data, available, all of the whistle languages, in existence, today, In paragraph no. 8, lines 5-6 say, “ . .. There are thought to be as many as 70 whistled languages still in use, though only 12 have been described and studied scientifically. .. ..” Here, only 12 have been described and studied scientifically = precise data available regarding 12 whistled languages, not all whistled languages, So, the answer is: FALSE Question no. 19: The children of Gomera now learn Silbo. Keywords for the question: children of Gomera, now learn, Silbo, In paragraph no. 9 (the final paragraph) the writer says in line no. 4, “ . .. .

Here, the writer says, “ . . .. That is still the case today for fishermen in an unmanaged fishery without quotas (overfishing), and for international logging companies with short-term leases on tropical rainforest land (destruction of trees) in places with corrupt officials and unsophisticated landowners. When government regulation if effective, and when the public is environmentally aware, environmentally clean big businesses may out-complete dirty ones, but the reverse is likely to be true if government regulation is ineffective (lack of control by governments) and if the public doesn’t care (lack of public involvement).” Here, candidates need to be careful to find the answers because all the answers given in the box with the questions are synonyms. Moreover, in the text, the answers are set in a tricky way. First, consider the lines , “ . .. . That is still the case today for fishermen in an unmanaged fishery without quotas (overfishing), and for international logging companies with short-term leases on tropical rainforest land (destruction of trees) in places with corrupt officials and unsophisticated landowners.. . ..” Here, we find the answers for questions no. 30 and 31. It’s because the writer has explained the results of big businesses without control or supervision. Then, in the following lines of the paragraph, the writer mentions, “ . . . When government regulation if effective, and when the public is environmentally aware, environmentally clean big businesses may out-complete dirty ones, but the reverse is likely to be true if government regulation is ineffective (lack of control by governments) and if the public doesn’t care (lack of public involvement).” These lines explain what happens when the government is aware and when it is not aware. In the last lines, the word ‘reverse’ is used to explain ‘the results when the government is not aware’. Here, we find the answers for questions no. 28 and 29. It’s because the writer has explained the reasons why big businesses are causing environmental problems. So, the answers are: E (control) F (involvement) H (overfishing) B (trees) Questions 32-34: Multiple choice questions [This type of question asks you to choose a suitable answer from the options using the knowledge you gained from the passage.

However, when a major fast-food company then made the same demands after customer purchases of its hamburgers plummeted, the meat industry complied within weeks. . …” Here, when a major fast-food company then made the same demands after customer purchases of its hamburgers plummeted, the meat industry complied within weeks = A fast-food company forced their meat suppliers to follow the law, So, the answer is: B (A fast-food company forced their meat suppliers to follow the law.)

But I think we have to recognize that, throughout human history, in all politically complex human societies, government regulation has arisen precisely because it was found that not only did moral principles need to be made explicit, they also needed to be enforced.” Here, these lines talk about why moral principles are important in business practices. However, we don’t find any comparison between the moral principles of different businesses. So, the answer is: NOT GIVEN Question no. 37: It is important to make a clear distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Keywords for the question: important, to make, clear distinction, between, acceptable, unacceptable, behaviour, In the first lines (lines 1-3) of the final paragraph, the author of the passage says, “To me, the conclusion that the public had the ultimate responsibility for the behavior of even the biggest businesses is empowering and hopeful, rather than disappointing. My conclusion is not a moralistic one about who is right or wrong, admirable or selfish, a good guy or a bad guy. . ..” Here, not a moralistic one about who is right or wrong, admirable or selfish, a good guy or a bad guy = NO clear distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, So, the answer is: NO Question no. 38: The public have successfully influenced businesses in the past. Keywords for the question: the public, successfully influenced, businesses, in the past, In the final paragraph, lines 3-6 say, “ .. .

Keywords for the question: future, businesses, will show, more concern, for, environment, Lines 6-7 in the final paragraph say, “ . .. . I predict that in the future, just as in the past, changes in public attitudes will be essential for changes in businesses’ environmental practices.” Here, the writer talks about what the effects of public attitudes will be for different changes in the environmental practices of big businesses.

My advisor gave me the opportunity to research on Environmental Kuznets Curve for pollutants and causes of global warming, which later got published in Energy Policy, Elsevier. I even got more excited when I practically observed how economic practice can result in forest development or exploitation by researching on indigenous Khasi community of Bangladesh who depends only on Betel leaf culture for their livelihood. Knowledge of these researches further increased my thirst to research on the economics of natural resources. **Comments **– একেবারে প্রথম প্যারাগ্রাফেই আমি বলে দিচ্ছি আমার রিসার্চ ইন্টেরেস্ট এর ব্যাপারে। এটা এজন্য করলাম, কারণ যেহেতু আমি রিসার্চ করতে চাই Natural Resource Economics নিয়ে, একজন faculty member যাতে শুরুতেই সিদ্ধান্ত নিতে পারে পুরো SOP-টা তাকে পড়তে হবে কি হবেনা। যেমন – একজন Wildlife Biologist অথবা Silviculture Specialist যদি পুরো এক পৃষ্ঠা পড়ার পর আবিষ্কার করে যে এটা আসলে ইকোনোমিকস সংক্রান্ত, এটা তার সময়ের অপচয়। So, start with clearly stating and justifying your interest. আপনার প্যাশনের কিছুটা এখানে উল্লেখ করতে পারেন। I entered into the realm of Environmental Science through my admission at the undergraduate level in the Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences under the University of Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is considered the best higher learning educational institution for environmental science in the country. I finished the undergraduate page of my academic repertoire with 3.48 on a scale of 4.00. My undergraduate course curriculum (total 192 credits) was balanced with courses of Microeconomic Theory and Econometrics like Principles of Economics, Environmental Resource Economics, Advanced Algebra and Trigonometry, Analytical Geometry and Calculus, Statistics, Research Methodology, and several other related courses that will help me in the pursuit of graduate study in environmental economics. I secured more than 70% marks in almost all the courses. Currently, I am working on “willingness to pay for living without waste pollution”. Through this research, I am trying to acquire comprehensive knowledge of the valuation technique which, I believe, will help me in my desired study. **Comments **– এরপর আপনাকে জাস্টিফাই করতে হবে, আপনি এই বিষয়ে হায়ার স্টাডি করার জন্য কতটা উপযুক্ত। আপনার একাডেমিক কোয়ালিফিকেশন, রিসার্চ এক্সপেরিয়েন্স নিয়ে (বিনয় সহকারে) ভাব মারতে পারেন এখানে। ঐ বিষয়ে রিসার্চ করার জন্য প্রয়োজনীয় অনার্স কোর্স আপনার ছিলো কিনা, থাকলে কি কি, সেগুলো বলতে পারেন। একাডেমিক লাইফ বলতে অনার্স অথবা মাস্টার্স লাইফ-এর কথা বোঝাচ্ছি, এর নিচে (এইচএসসি’র দিকে) যাওয়া লাগবে না। I wish to continue my research on the economics of energy; more precisely, wood-based bioenergy. I would like to research remodeling the valuation approaches of those resources to make it more apposite and just. My tentative targets would be- a. Facilitation of forest resource management for the diverse environments using quantitative tools. b. Determination of a policy that best minimizes both environmental and economic loss while using key forest resources. c. How will the market behave when a certain forest resource policy is introduced? **Comments **– সামান্য কিছু স্পেসিফিকস, ফ্যাকাল্টি মেম্বারকে দেখানোর জন্য যে এই ব্যাপারে আপনার more or less clear idea আছে। যতই চান, আপনার ভবিষ্যত প্রজেক্ট নিয়ে সম্পূর্ণ পরিষ্কার আইডিয়া থাকা সম্ভব না, থাকলে আর গ্র্যাজুয়েট স্টাডি করার দরকার কি? হি হি হি…… তাই, বেশি টেনশন করার দরকার নেই। It will be of most help in making sustainable policy for my country’s forest resources. Being a resourceful developing country overburdened with a huge population, Bangladesh needs to utilize its resources with the highest efficiency. I hope to contribute to the country’s natural resource management plan with my expertise after I am done with my graduate study. The application of my research will also have an impact on gauging the world’s natural resources outside my country. **Comments** – এই রিসার্চটার scope কেমন, কার কী কাজে লাগবে, সেগুলোর সামান্য বর্ণনা দেয়া দরকার। সোজা কথায়, what is the big picture of your research? My research intention is to learn so that I can spread it. I dream to become a faculty member in a university where I can continue my research and teaching. To attain my goal, I need to make myself more efficient in my doctoral study which can be attained by working in an amicable environment, with obliging colleagues and extensive academic resources along with my perseverance. I believe, School of Forest Resources is the appropriate graduate school for me, as it provides all of the above including superior education from the highly qualified faculty members in the field of natural resource economics. Here, I wish to receive an education that will give me both the technical skills and the intellectual discipline to fulfill my dream of becoming a perfect researcher and a teacher. My interest in resource economics drove me to get involved in a number of relevant researches. I wish to continue along the same route if I get the chance at the University of Arkansas at Monticello. **Comments **– শেষের অনুচ্ছেদটা দুটো মেইন পয়েন্ট কভার করবে। এক, আপনার ভবিষ্যৎ পরিকল্পনা কী। দুই, কেন এই স্কুল এবং কেন এই প্রোগ্রাম আপনার জন্য বেস্ট ফিট। এই প্রশ্নগুলোর উত্তর ভালোভাবে সাজানো জরুরি। **লিখেছেনঃ ফরহাদ হোসেন মাসুম (nextopusa)**",

      "content_clean": "উচ্চশিক্ষা অর্জনে দক্ষিণ কোরিয়া কেন অনন্য উচ্চশিক্ষা অর্জনে কোথায় পড়ালেখা করবেন, সে বিষয়ে সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়া জীবনের একটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ দিক। কেননা তার উপর ভিত্তি করেই আপনার পুরো ভবিষ্যৎ নির্ভর করছে। সারাবিশ্বের মধ্যে একটি দেশ বাছাই করা হয়তো খুব কষ্টসাধ্য মনে হতে পারে। কারণ, পড়ালেখার মান, জীবনযাত্রা, আবাসন ব্যবস্থাসহ অন্যান্য বিষয় সব দেশে এক রকম হয় না। তাছাড়া শিক্ষার্থীদের একাডেমিক রেজাল্ট এবং আর্থিক অবস্থাও মুখ্য বিষয় হিসেবে গণ্য। শিক্ষার্থীদের কাছে সাধারণত যুক্তরাষ্ট্র, যুক্তরাজ্য, কানাডা, জার্মানি কিংবা ইউরোপিয়ান দেশগুলো প্রাধান্য পেয়ে থাকে। তবে উন্নতব্যবস্থাসম্পন্ন এমন অনেক দেশ থাকতে পারে, যা আপনি হয়তো বিবেচনাও করেননি। তাই এই ব্যাপারে সময় নিয়ে একটু ঘেঁটে দেখাই বুদ্ধিমানের কাজ। আন্তর্জাতিক শিক্ষার্থী হিসাবে এশিয়ান দেশ দক্ষিণ কোরিয়ায় পড়ালেখা করা আপনার জন্য বেশ বৈচিত্র্যময় হয়ে উঠতে পারে। কেননা, দেশটিতে বিশ্বমানের শিক্ষাব্যবস্থার পাশাপাশি পাচ্ছেন আকর্ষণীয় কোরিয়ান সংস্কৃতির সান্নিধ্য, মনোরম আবহাওয়া বেষ্টিত চমৎকার পরিচ্ছন্ন পরিবেশ ও উন্নত জীবনব্যবস্থা। আনুষ্ঠানিকভাবে রিপাবলিক অব কোরিয়া নামকরণ করা হলেও দেশটি দক্ষিণ কোরিয়া হিসেবেই সবার নিকট পরিচিত। আজকের পর্বে দক্ষিণ কোরিয়ায় পড়ালেখার সুযোগ-সুবিধাগুলো তুলে ধরবো। শিক্ষাব্যবস্থাঃ এখানের বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোতে ইংরেজি ও কোরিয়ান উভয় ভাষার কোর্স রয়েছে। তবে উভয় ক্ষেত্রেই ভাষা দক্ষতার প্রমাণপত্র দেখাতে হবে। ব্যাচেলর, মাস্টার্স ও পিএইচডি করার জন্য শিক্ষার্থীরা কোরিয়ায় যেতে পারেন। ব্যাচেলর ডিগ্রির মেয়াদ সাধারণত তিন থেকে চার বছর, মাস্টার্স ডিগ্রির মেয়াদ এক থেকে দুই বছর এবং ডক্টরাল/ পিএইচডি ডিগ্রির মেয়াদ তিন থেকে পাঁচ বছর হয়ে থাকে। কোরিয়ান শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোতে ফল ও স্প্রিং এই দুই সেমিস্টারে শিক্ষার্থীরা আবেদন করতে পারেন। সাউথ কোরিয়ায় ব্যাচেলর প্রোগ্রামে ভর্তি বেশ প্রতিযোগিতামূলক। এসএসসি, এইচএসসি অথবা ও-লেভেল, এ-লেভেলে খুব ভালো ফলাফলের পাশাপাশি ‘সহশিক্ষামূলক’ কাজের সঙ্গে যুক্ত থাকলে সুবিধা পাওয়া যায়। ভালো শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোতে ভর্তির জন্য এসবের বিকল্প নেই। স্বল্প খরচঃ দেশটির মুদ্রার মান বাংলাদেশি টাকার তুলনায় খুবই কম। কোরিয়ান ১০০ ওন, বাংলাদেশি মুদ্রায় মাত্র ৮ টাকার কাছাকাছি। তাই এদেশের শিক্ষার্থীদের জন্য স্বল্প খরচে পড়ালেখা করার এটি একটি সুবর্ণ সুযোগ। তাছাড়া আবাসন, খাদ্য ও পরিবহন ব্যয়ও স্বল্প খরচে মিটিয়ে ফেলা যায়। দক্ষিণ কোরিয়ায় টিউশন ফি ও থাকা খাওয়ার খরচ যুক্তরাজ্য, যুক্তরাষ্ট্র, অষ্ট্রেলিয়া বা কানাডার চেয়ে কম। তবে, এদেশের ডিগ্রির মান ইউরোপের দেশগুলোর চেয়ে কোনো অংশে কম নয়। সিউলের মতো বড় শহরগুলোতে টিউশন ফি ও থাকা-খাওয়ার খরচ একটু বেশি, তবে অন্যান্য শহরগুলোতে খরচ কম। প্রসিদ্ধ শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানঃ দক্ষিণ কোরিয়া তার শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোর জন্য বিখ্যাত। এখানে রয়েছে কিছু প্রসিদ্ধ শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠান, যারা বিশ্বমানের শিক্ষার ব্যবস্থা করে থাকে। এদেশের তিনটি বৃহত্তম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় হলো কোরিয়া বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়, সিওল ন্যাশনাল বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় ও ইয়োনসেই বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়। মানসম্মত শিক্ষার পাশাপাশি রয়েছে মেধাবি শিক্ষার্থীদের জন্য স্কলারশিপের ব্যবস্থা। আন্তরিকতাঃ কোরিয়ান নাগরিকেরা আচার-আচরণ এবং ব্যবহারের দিক থেকে অত্যন্ত বিনয়ী। বাইরের দেশের শিক্ষার্থীদের তারা বেশ আন্তরিকভাবেই স্বাগত জানায়। তারা প্রায়শই তাদের সংস্কৃতির সঙ্গে অপরিচিতদের পরিচয় করিয়ে দিতে পছন্দ করে। তাই আপনি খুব সহজেই তাদের কাছ থেকে সেই দেশের আদ্যোপান্ত সম্পর্কে শিখে নিতে পারবেন। ভাষা শিক্ষাঃ এদেশে বেশিরভাগ বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় একাডেমিক কোর্সের পাশাপাশি কোরিয়ান ভাষার কোর্সেরও ব্যবস্থা করে থাকে। তাই যারা শিক্ষাঅর্জন শেষে দেশটিতে স্থায়ী হওয়ার পরিকল্পনা করছেন, তারা পাশাপাশি কোরিয়ান ভাষাও শিখে নিতে পারেন। কারণ, স্থানীয় ভাষা শিখতে পারলে, দ্রুতই সেখানে বসবাসের যোগ্য হয়ে যাবেন ও পড়ালেখা শেষে ভালো চাকরির সুযোগ পাওয়া সহজ হয়ে যাবে। খাদ্য বৈচিত্র্যঃ আপনি যদি কম দামে মজাদার ও সুস্বাদু খাবার খেতে চান, তাহলে দক্ষিণ কোরিয়া আপনার জন্য একদম সঠিক জায়গা। খাদ্য বৈচিত্র্য এদেশের সংস্কৃতির অংশ। কোরিয়ার মানুষের খাবারের মধ্যে সাধারণত ভাত, মাছ, মাংস, স্যুপ, সবজি এবং কিছু বিশেষ ধরনের খাবার টোফু, সোজু, মাকজোলি ও বকবুনজা জু ইত্যাদি জনপ্রিয়। এছাড়াও এখানের স্ট্রিট ফুড খুবই জনপ্রিয়। এদেশে রাস্তার পাশে সারি সারি স্ট্রিট ফুডের দোকান রয়েছে, যেগুলো স্বল্পমূল্যে মানসম্মত খাবার সরবরাহ করে থাকে। বেশিরভাগ রেস্তোরাঁ গভীর রাত পর্যন্ত খোলা থাকে। এমনকি কিছু কিছু রেস্তোরাঁ ২৪ ঘণ্টা খাবার ডেলিভারি সেবা দিয়ে থাকে। আবাসন ব্যবস্থাঃ দক্ষিণ কোরিয়ায় পড়াশোনার জন্য যেতে চাইলে আপনাকে আবাসন নিয়ে তেমন একটা মাথা ঘামাতে হবে না। কারণ প্রায় সব শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানেই শিক্ষার্থীদের জন্য হোস্টেলের ব্যবস্থা রয়েছে। আপনি স্বল্প খরচে এসব হোস্টেলে থাকতে পারবেন। কাজের সুযোগঃ উচ্চশিক্ষা গ্রহণের পাশাপাশি শিক্ষার্থীরা চাইলেই সপ্তাহে ২০ ঘণ্টা খণ্ডকালীন কাজ করতে পারেন। তাছাড়া, শিক্ষার্থীরা ছুটির সময় ফুলটাইম কাজের সুযোগ পেয়ে থাকেন। টিউশন ফিঃ সাধারণত, জাতীয় বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোতে বেসরকারি বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের তুলনায় টিউশন ফি কম হয়ে থাকে। যেহেতু কলেজ বা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোর উপর নির্ভর করে টিউশন ফি পৃথক হতে পারে, তাই কলেজ বা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় নির্ধারণের ক্ষেত্রে তাদের ওয়েবসাইটগুলোতে ফি’র ব্যাপার নিশ্চিত হয়ে নেওয়া উত্তম। তবে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় ও কোর্স ভেদে ১৫০০ মার্কিন ডলার থেকে ১৫,০০০ ডলার পর্যন্ত খরচ হতে পারে। গ্লোবাল কোরিয়া স্কলারশিপঃ সব দেশের মধ্যে শিক্ষার ক্ষেত্রে আন্তর্জাতিক বিনিময় এবং পারস্পরিক বন্ধুত্ব প্রচারের লক্ষ্যে কোরিয়াতে উচ্চতর শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে প্রতিবছর সরকারিভাবে গ্লোবাল কোরিয়া স্কলারশিপের ব্যবস্থা করে থাকে। বৃত্তিপ্রাপ্ত শিক্ষার্থীরা টিউশন ফি’সহ অন্যান্য সব খাতে আর্থিক সুবিধা পেয়ে থাকেন।",

ওয়েল, উত্তর দেবার আগে সহজ সূত্রের মতো একটা কথা বলে রাখি — মনে রাখবেন, যে দেশে ঢোকা যত সহজ, সেখানে টেকা তত কঠিন”। কাজেই, শর্টকাটের সন্ধানে বিশ্বের অনেক দেশই আপনাকে “উচ্চশিক্ষা বা স্কলারশিপ” এর টোপ দেখাতে পারে, কিন্তু দীর্ঘমেয়াদী হিসাবে ইনভেস্টমেন্টের রিটার্ন তুলে আনার অঙ্কে ইউএসএ সেসব দেশের তুলনায় বহুগুণ এগিয়ে। আবারো বলছি, অ্যামেরিকায় আসা কঠিন মানেই যে আপনি ইউএসএকে তালিকা থেকে বাদ দিয়ে দেবেন, ব্যাপারটা যেন তা না হয়। আর ইউএসএতে আসা কঠিন নাকি সহজ তা নির্ভর করছে আপনি আপনার প্রোফাইলের বিপরীতে কোন ধরণের প্রোগ্রাম নির্বাচন করে কিভাবে আবেদন করছেন তার উপরে। অনেকের জন্য এটা একেবারেই সহজ, আবার অনেকের জন্য প্রায় অসম্ভব। আপনার উচিত হবে শুরুতেই পজিটিভ অ্যাটিচুড নিয়ে যাত্রা শুরু করা। প্রধান কয়েকটা কারণ তুলে ধরছি, কেন ইউএসএ পুরো পৃথিবীর স্টুডেন্টদের সবচেয়ে পছন্দের গন্তব্য। (১) বিনিয়োগকৃত টাকার বিপরীতে প্রাপ্ত ডিগ্রির “ভ্যালু” ধরা যাক আপনি 0% স্কলারশিপ পেলেন, মানে পুরো টাকাটাই পকেট থেকে দিয়ে পড়লেন। তার পরেও যে মানের ডিগ্রি আপনি পাবেন এবং প্রাপ্ত ডিগ্রি দিয়ে বিশাল জব মার্কেটে যতটা স্বাচ্ছন্দে নিজেকে সেট করে নিতে পারবেন, তা পৃথিবীর অনেক দেশেই সম্ভব না। সারা দুনিয়ার কোম্পানিগুলো চেষ্টা করে আমেরিকায় যেন তাদের একটা অফিস থাকে। বিদেশী প্রতিষ্ঠান একটু ব্যবসায় ভালো করতে পারলেই নিউইয়র্ক, এলএ বা মায়ামিতে একটা অফিস খুলে ফেলে নিজেদের ইমেজ বাড়ানোর জন্য। যার ফলে প্রতিদিনই একেকটা নতুন প্রতিষ্ঠান আমেরিকার মাটিতে প্রতিষ্ঠিত হচ্ছে, নতুন জবের ক্ষেত্র তৈরী হচ্ছে। ভালো একটা ইউনিভার্সিটি থেকে পড়া শেষে ঠিক মতো নেটওয়ার্কিং করতে পারলে সহজেই জব মার্কেটে নিজেকে সেট করে নিতে পারবেন। তবে মনে রাখতে হবে, এই “সহজে” মানে কিন্তু আরাম আয়েসে হাত গুটিয়ে বসে থাকা নয়। আগেই বলেছি, শর্টকাটে কিছু কোনোখানেই হয় না। (২) যে কোন সাবজেক্ট যে কোন ব্যাকগ্রাউন্ড থেকে অ্যামেরিকায় ব্যালেন্সড ডাইভার্সিটি প্রমোট করে। মানে এখানে আপনি বায়োলজি থেকে ব্যাচেলর শেষ করে কম্পিউটার সায়েন্সের কোন প্রফেসরের বায়োলজিকাল ফিল্ডের একটা রিসার্চে যুক্ত হতে পারেন । খুব স্পেসিফিক কয়েকটা সাবেজক্ট বাদে মোটামুটি সবখানেই ডাইভার্সিটিকে স্বাগত জানানো হয়। আপনি মিউজিকে পড়ে এসেছেন, এবার ফার্মেসি পড়তে চান? ব্যাস, কোন অসুবিধা নেই। কোন একটা কমিউনিটি কলেজে গিয়ে অ্যানাটমি ফিজিওলজি কোর্স করে নিন, অনলাইনে ক্যালকুলাস কোর্স করে নিন, ব্যাস, আপনি অধিকাংশ ফার্মেসি স্কুলের জন্য অ্যাপ্লাই করতে পারবেন। বয়েস, স্টাডি গ্যাপ বা ভিন্ন ব্যাকগ্রাউন্ডে আন্ডারগ্র্যাড করে আসা এগুলো আমেরিকার জন্য কোন বিষয়ই না। (৩) আকাশচুম্বী রিসার্চ ফান্ড NSF, NIH, DOD, DOE ছাড়াও স্টেটের নিজস্ব অসংখ্য ছোট খাটো ফান্ডিং সোর্স থাকে। তেলা মাথায় তেল দেবার মতো যে প্রফেসররা গ্র্যান্ট পান, যাদের টিম বড় এবং পাবলিকেশন বেশি, তারা গ্র্যান্টও পান বেশি। মোট আর এন্ড ডি বাজেটে নিকটতম প্রতিদ্বন্দ্বী চায়নার (378 বিলিয়ন) থেকে আমেরিকা অনেক এগিয়ে (584 বিলিয়ন)। এবং সব চেয়ে বড় কথা হলো, রিসার্চের পেছনে আমেরিকার বিনিয়োগের সংষ্কৃতি চায়নার মতো দশ পনের বছর আগে শুরু হয়নি। এটা তারা করে আসছে মোটামুটি দ্বিতীয় বিশ্বযুদ্ধের পর থেকে। চায়না রিসেন্টলি উঠে এসেছে (তিরিশ বছর আগে, 1991 সালে এদের ছিল 13 বিলিয়ন, যখন আমেরিকার ছিল 257 বিলিয়ন)। 2009 সাল থেকে চায়না টানা দ্বিতীয় অবস্থানে আছে তাই অনেকেই ভুল করে ভেবে বসেন যে চায়না বোধ হয় আমেরিকাকে ছাড়িয়ে গেছে, ব্যাপারটা আসলে সেরকম না। আপনি যদি রিসার্চে বুঁদ হয়ে থাকতে চান, তাহলে মনে রাখবেন অ্যামেরিকার ফেডারেল থেকে শুরু করে স্টেট এমনকি কাউন্টি লেভেলের পুঁচকে ইউনিয়ন পর্যন্ত আপনাকে টাকা গ্র্যান্ট করার জন্য বসে আছে — শুধু পাবার যোগ্যতা অর্জন করতে হবে। (৪) ক্যাম্পাস, ফ্র্যাটার্নিটি এবং নেটওয়ার্ক এই ব্যাপারটা গ্র্যাজুয়েট স্টুডেন্টরা পুরোপুরি উপলব্ধি করতে পারেন না। ইউ এস ইউনিভার্সিটির প্রত্যেকটা আন্ডারগ্র্যাড স্টুডেন্ট তার নিজের ক্যাম্পাস ম্যাস্কট থেকে শুরু করে অ্যাথলেটিক টিম, মোটো এবং ছোট ছোট অর্গ্যানাইজেশনের সুসম্পর্ক অনেক গভীর পর্যন্ত উপলব্ধি করতে পারেন। ইউনিভার্সিটিতে শিক্ষকতা করার সময় আমি ফাই ডেল্টা কাই নামে একটা প্রফেশনাল ব্রাদারহুডের মেন্টর ছিলাম, তাদের নিয়ম কানুন এবং অন্যান্য ‘ব্রাদার’দের সাথে পেশাদারী সম্পর্ক বিষয়ে তাই কিছুটা জানি। এছাড়া অসংখ্য প্রফেশনাল কনফারেন্স এবং অন-ক্যাম্পাস ক্যারিয়ার ফেয়ারে অ্যালামনাইদের সাথে যোগাযোগ রক্ষা করে জবে সহজে প্লেসমেন্ট এক বিশাল সুবিধা। আমেরিকা দেশটা এমনিতেই অনেক বড়, জায়গার অভাব নেই। তাই ক্যাম্পাসগুলোও অনেক ব্যাপক জায়গা নিয়ে নির্মাণ হয় (আর্বান ক্যাম্পাসগুলো ছাড়া)। একটা আমেরিকান বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে পড়তে পারা তাই জীবন বদলে দেওয়ার সুযোগের অপর নাম। (৫) কালচারাল ডাইভার্সিটি এবং ইনক্লুশন ইনক্লুশন মানে হলো আপনি যত “উদ্ভট”-ই হোন না কেন, আপনাকে আমেরিকান বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলো আপন করে নেবে। আপনি ট্রান্সজেন্ডার? সারা জীবন ভয়ে কুঁকড়ে কেটেছে? আমেরিকায় যে কোন বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে আপনি নিজের পছন্দের পরিচয়ে বাঁচতে পারবেন (ভয়ের বিপরীত হলো PRIDE, এবং এলজিবিটিকিউপ্লাস এর প্রতীক হিসাবে প্রাইড পতাকা ব্যবহৃত হয়)। আপনি হিজাব করেন? রঙ অন্যরকম? আপনার এই ডাইভার্সিটিকে গ্রহণ ও বরণ করার জন্যই আমেরিকান বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলো বিশেষ ভাবে প্রস্তুত হয়ে আছে। (৬) পড়া শেষে জব এবং ইমিগ্রেশন হ্যা, আমেরিকায় যে কোন সাবজেক্টে পড়ালেখা করলেই ১ বছরের ওয়ার্ক পারমিট (ওপিটি) পাওয়া যায়। আর স্টেম হলে আরো দুই বছর বেশি। আগেই বলেছি, এমপ্লয়ারের সংখ্যা বেশি বলে চাকরি পাওয়া যায় পৃথিবীর অনেক দেশের থেকে অনেক সহজেই। ভাষারও কোন অসুবিধা নেই — সবখানেই ইংলিশ (যদিনা আপনি হিস্পানিক পপুলেশনের সাথে কাজ করার চাকুরি নেন)। বৈধ উপায় স্টুডেন্ট থেকে গ্রিন কার্ড প্রাপ্তির অনেকগুলো উপায় আছে। মাস্টার্স, পিএইচডি বা প্রফেশনাল সাবজেক্টে (ফার্মেসি, ল বা নার্সিং ইত্যাদি) পড়ালেখা করলে ন্যাশনাল ইন্টারেস্ট ওয়েইভারের আওতাও গ্রিনকার্ডও পাওয়া যায়। আমেরিকার জব মার্কেটে টিকতে হলে আমেরিকা থেকে নেওয়া ডিগ্রির বিকল্প নেই। তাই ভালে প্রোগ্র্যামে ভর্তি হবার পরে আপনি নিজের অজান্তেই এমন একটা সিস্টেমের অংশ হয়ে যাবেন যেখানে জব বা গ্রিনকার্ড প্রাপ্তি এগুলো সব একটার পর একটা হতেই থাকবে। আপনি লিটারেলি চিন্তা করতে পারেন: স্কাই ইজ দ্যা লিমিট। আর অবশ্যই মনে রাখবেন, শিক্ষার থেকে বড় বিনিয়োগ আর হয় না। আলসেমিতে নষ্ট হয়ে যাওয়া সময়ের চেয়ে লোকসান আর হয় না",

It’s easy !! শেষ…… এবার ওদের সিদ্ধান্তের অপেক্ষা।",

দিয়ে আসাটা কিছুটা মুশকিলের ব্যাপার। তাই, এখানে বসেই এই পরীক্ষাটা দিতে পারবেন। এরপর এই স্কোর ওদের কাছে পাঠিয়ে দিলেই ওরা বুঝতে পারবে, আপনার যোগ্যতা কতখানি…… এই নোটে আমরা SAT I (general test) নিয়ে আলোচনা করবো। SAT II (subject test)-ও আছে, অনেকে SAT I এর পাশাপাশি SAT II-ও চায়। তবে সেই গল্প আরেকদিন। আসুন, ঢুকে পড়ি… SAT : একজন শিক্ষার্থী বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে পড়াশোনার জন্য কতটা প্রস্তুত, তার পরীক্ষা হয় স্যাট টেস্টের মাধ্যমে। SAT এর পূর্ণরূপ হলো Scholastic Aptitude Test। স্কুল এবং কলেজ পর্যায়ে ইংরেজী পড়া, লেখা এবং গণিতে অর্জিত দক্ষতার পরীক্ষা নেয়া হয় এই ধাপে স্নাতক পর্যায়ে বিদেশে পড়তে যাওয়ার জন্য যাঁদের প্রথম পছন্দ যুক্তরাষ্ট্র বা কানাডা, তাদের জন্যেও স্যাট (SAT) অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ একটি পরীক্ষা। একজন শিক্ষার্থী বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় পর্যায়ে শিক্ষা যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের বেশির ভাগ বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে ভর্তির আবেদনের সঙ্গে স্যাট স্কোর জমা দেওয়া বাধ্যতামূলক। তাই বলে এমন নয় যে, যেসব বিদ্যালয়ে স্যাট স্কোর চাইবে না, তাদের জন্য স্যাট এক্সাম দিবো না। সেসব বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের ক্ষেত্রে শিক্ষাবৃত্তি পাওয়ার জন্য স্যাট পরীক্ষার স্কোর বেশ কাজে দেয়। SAT যেভাবে হয়: ৩ ঘন্টা ৪৫ মিনিটের SAT এক্সামকে Critical Reading, Math এবং Writing- মোট তিনটি অংশে ভাগ করা হয়। আর প্রতিটি অংশে ৮০০ করে মোট ২৪০০ মার্কের পরীক্ষা হয়। Critical reading– এ সাধারণত শব্দজ্ঞান, ছোট-বড় বিভিন্ন Passage পড়ে অনুধাবন করার ও তার ওপর ভিত্তি করে প্রশ্নের উত্তর দেওয়ার ক্ষমতা যাচাই করা হয়। Math- অংশের প্রশ্নগুলোর মধ্যে রয়েছে পাটিগণিত, বীজগণিত, জ্যামিতি ও ত্রিকোণমিতি-সংক্রান্ত সমস্যার সমাধানজনিত প্রশ্ন। Writing- অংশে থাকে বাক্য ও প্যারাগ্রাফ উন্নতিকরণ সম্পর্কিত প্রশ্ন, যেখানে একাধিক সম্ভাব্য উত্তরের মধ্য থেকে সঠিক উত্তরটি খুঁজে বের করতে হয়। এ ছাড়া এ অংশে নির্ধারিত বিষয়ের ওপর একটি Essay লিখতে দেওয়া হবে, যার জন্য বরাদ্দকৃত সময় মাত্র ২৫ মিনিট। তাই সময়ের দিকে খেয়াল রেখেই লিখা শুরু করতে হবে। ২০১৬ সালের মার্চ মাস থেকে SAT পরীক্ষায় বেশ কিছু পরিবর্তন এসেছে। নতুন পরীক্ষা কাঠামোয় SAT পরীক্ষার মোট নাম্বার ১৬০০। প্রতিটি সেকশনে ৮০০ নম্বর। তবে এর সাথে অপশনাল হিসেবে থাকছে Essay Writing। এর জন্য আলাদাভাবে ৬-২৪ স্কেলে নাম্বার দেয়া হবে। নতুন পদ্ধতির SAT পরীক্ষায় ২ টা প্রধান সেকশন থাকছে। যেমন – Mathematics section এবং Evidence based reading- writing section। পূর্বে reading এবং writing আলাদা সেকশন হিসেবে থাকলেও নতুন SAT কাঠামোয় দুটি মিলে মূল একটি সেকশন করা হয়েছে। Evidence Based Reading Section: এই সেকশনে ৬৫ মিনিট সময়ে ৫২ টি প্রশ্নের করতে হবে। মোট ৪টি প্যাসেজ থাকবে। প্রতি ১০টি প্রশ্নের জন্য একটি করে প্যাসেজ। প্রশ্নগুলো সাধারণত এমসিকিউ ধরনের। প্রতিটি প্রশ্নের জন্য ৫টি করে অপশন থাকবে। প্যাসেজ ১: Reading section এ প্রথম প্যাসেজ সাধারণত প্রসিদ্ধ ইংরেজি উপন্যাস এবং গল্প থেকে নেয়া হবে। এই প্যাসেজটি পরে ১-১০ পর্যন্ত প্রশ্নের উত্তর করতে হবে। প্যাসেজ ২: দ্বিতীয় প্যাসেজও কোন উপন্যাস কিংবা প্রকাশিত ম্যাগাজিনের গল্প থেকে নেয়া হবে। তবে এর সাথে একটি বার চার্ট থাকতে পারে। এই প্যাসেজটি পরে ১১-২১ পর্যন্ত প্রশ্নের উত্তর করতে হবে। প্যাসেজ ৩: তৃতীয় প্যাসেজের সাথে থাকবে একটি ডাটা টেবিল। যা থেকে ২২-৩২ পর্যন্ত প্রশ্নগুলোর উত্তর করতে হবে। প্যাসেজ ৪: চতুর্থ প্যাসেজটি তুলনামূলক একটু বড় হয়। যা থেকে ৩২-৪১ পর্যন্ত প্রশ্নগুলোর উত্তর করতে হবে। প্যাসেজ ৫: পঞ্চম প্যাসেজে আবার দুটি অংশ থাকতে পারে। এই প্যাসেজটি থেকে ৪২-৫২ পর্যন্ত প্রশ্নগুলোর উত্তর করতে হবে। Writing and Language Test Section: SAT পরীক্ষার অন্যান্য সেকশনের তুলনায় writing সেকশনে সব থেকে বেশি পরিবর্তন এসেছে। এই সেকশনে ৩৫ মিনিট সময়ে ৪৪ টি প্রশ্নের করতে হবে। এই সেকশনটিও প্যাসেজ ভিত্তিক এবং উত্তরগুলো এমসিকিউ ধরনের। এর মধ্যে প্যাসেজে প্রতিটি প্রশ্নের জন্য আন্ডার লাইন করা অংশ থেকে তথ্য নিয়ে সঠিক উত্তরগুলো করতে হবে। রাইটিং সেকশনে Standard English Conventions অংশে থাকছে ২০ টি প্রশ্ন। যার মধ্যে থাকবে Covering sentence structure, conventions of usage এবং conventions of punctuation এমন ধরনের ছোট ইংলিশ গ্রামারের প্রয়োগ সংক্রান্ত। এছাড়াও Expression of Ideas অংশ থেকে আসবে ২৪ টি প্রশ্ন। Mathematics Section: এই অংশে অধিকাংশ প্রশ্নই MCQ ধরণের। প্রতিটি ভুল উত্তরের পূর্বে নাম্বার কাটা হলেও নতুন সংস্করণে তা থাকছে না। এর মধ্যে প্রথম ভাগে আসা ২০টি প্রশ্নে ক্যালকুলেটর ব্যবহার করা যাবে না। তবে পরের সাইন্টেফিক ক্যালকুলেটর ব্যবহার করা যাবে। No Calculator Use Section: ২০টি প্রশ্নের জন্য ২৫ মিনিট সময়। এই সেকশনে ৩টা সাব-সেকশন। এই ম্যাথ সেকশনটিতে ক্যালকুলেটর ব্যবহার নিষেধ। দুইটি প্যাটার্নে প্রশ্ন হয়ে থাকে – প্যাটার্ন ১: MCQ ধরণের প্রশ্ন আসবে। আপনার কাজ হবে সঠিক উত্তরটি বাছাই করা। ১৫ টি প্রশ্নের উত্তর করতে হবে। প্যাটার্ন ২: এখানে আপনাকে ৫ টি গ্রিড-ইন টাইপ প্রশ্ন দেওয়া হবে (অংক করে খালি ঘরে উত্তর লিখতে হবে)। Calculator Use Section: ৩৮টি প্রশ্নের জন্য ৫৫ মিনিট সময়। এই সেকশনে ৪টা সাব-সেকশন আছে। এই সেকশনে সায়েন্টিফিক ক্যালকুলেটর ব্যবহার করা যাবে। এখানেও দুই প্যাটার্নে প্রশ্ন হবে- প্যাটার্ন ১: সাব সেকশনটির প্রথম ভাবে ৩০ টি ম্যাথ থাকবে। যেগুলো সমাধান করে সঠিক উত্তরটি বাছাই করতে হবে। এর মধ্যে অনেক ম্যাথের জন্য আলাদা ভাবে ডাটা দেয়া থাকবে। যেখান থেকে তথ্য নিয়ে ম্যাথ সমাধান করতে হবে। প্যাটার্ন ২: এই প্যাটার্নে ৮টি ম্যাথ থাকবে। যেগুলো গ্রিড-ইন টাইপ প্রশ্ন (অংক করে খালি ঘরে উত্তর লিখতে হবে) হয়। SAT এর জন্য প্রস্তুতি: ভালো এবং পরিকল্পিতভাবে পড়া ছাড়া স্যাটে ভাল ফলাফল করার উপায় নেই। তাই শুরুতেই আপনি নিজের টার্গেট স্কোরটি ঠিক করে নিন এবং সে অনুসারে পড়া শুরু করে দিন। সাধারণত একাদশ শ্রেণি থেকে স্যাটের প্রিপারেশন নেওয়াটা সুবিধাজনক। নিজের সুবিধামত একটা সময় থেকে প্রিপারেশন নেওয়া শুরু করুন, কেননা স্যাট এক্সাম বছরের যেকোনো সময়েই দেওয়া যায়। অফিশিয়াল স্যাট স্টাডি গাইড, ব্যারন’স, ব্যারন’স, প্রিন্সটন রিভিউ, কাপলান, গ্রুবার’স, ম্যাকগ্র-হিল ইত্যাদি বইয়ের সাহায্য নিয়ে স্যাট পরীক্ষার জন্য নিজেকে তৈরি করা যায়। এসব বইয়ের সবই ঢাকার নীলক্ষেতে পাওয়া যায়। তা ছাড়া বারিধারায় অবস্থিত আমেরিকান সেন্টারের লাইব্রেরিতেও রয়েছে স্যাটের প্রস্তুতিমূলক বইয়ের চমৎকার সংগ্রহ, যা লাইব্রেরিতে বসে ব্যবহারের সুযোগ রয়েছে। এইসব সহায়ক বই ছাড়াও নিয়মিত ইংরেজি বই ও পত্রিকা পড়ার অভ্যাসও আপনাদের গড়ে তোলা উচিত৷ অনুশীলনের জন্য যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের কলেজ বোর্ড থেকে প্রকাশিত অফিশিয়াল স্যাট বইয়ের প্র্যাকটিস টেস্ট অনুসরণ করা যেতে পারে। Critical Reading এ দুটি অংশ থাকে, একটি হলো সেনটেন্স কমপ্লিশন এবং কমপ্রিহেনশন। সেনটেন্স কমপ্লিশন অনেকটা শূন্যস্থানের মতো হয়। প্রশ্নপত্রে দেওয়া অপশন থেকে উত্তর দিতে হয়। এখানে ভালো করতে হলে পছন্দের টপিক অনুসারে প্রচুর বই পড়তে হবে। নতুন শব্দ পেলে তা নোটবুকে সব ধরনের অর্থসহ (Synonym, antonym) টুকে রাখতে হবে। পরবর্তী সময়ে অনুশীলন করতে হবে। কমপ্রিহেনশনে নির্দিষ্ট সময়ের মধ্যে শেষ করতে সমস্যা হয় সবারই। তাই প্রথমে প্রশ্ন ভালভাবে পড়ে প্যাসেজের মধ্যে উত্তরগুলো পেন্সিল দিয়ে দাগিয়ে নিয়ে লিখা শুরু করতে হবে। রচনার মাধ্যমে Writing পার্টটা শুরু হয়। রচনা সাধারণত যুক্তিনির্ভর এসে থাকে৷ যেমন: ‘’ইন্টারনেট আশির্বাদ নাকি অভিশাপ’৷ এই ক্ষেত্রে দুই পক্ষেরই যুক্তি দেখাতে হবে। এবং এই রচনা অংশের নম্বর প্রায় দেড়শের কাছাকাছি হয়। তাই উদাহরণ দিয়ে দুই পৃষ্ঠার মধ্যে সবরকম অপ্রয়োজনীয় কথা বাদ দিয়ে রচনা লিখে শেষ করতে হবে৷ নাহলে বেশ ভাল নম্বর হাতছাড়া হয়ে যেতে পারে। এরপর আছে ভুল বাক্যকে শুদ্ধ করা ও ভুল চিহ্নিত করা৷ আর প্রথম দিকের অংকগুলো সহজই হয়, সেগুলো খুব দ্রুতই করা যাবে। SAT একটি অত্যন্ত ব্যয়বহুল পরীক্ষা। তাই ভালভাবে প্রিপারেশন নিয়েই এই পরীক্ষায় বসা উচিত। SAT পরীক্ষার মোট সময় ৩ ঘন্টা। আর অপশনাল হিসেবে থাকা Essay সেকশনে অংশ নিলে মোট সময়ের সাথে আরও ৫০ মিনিট যোগ হবে। স্যাট দেওয়ার জন্য প্রথমেই SAT এর অফিশিয়াল ওয়েবসাইটে (www. collegeboard. org) গিয়ে অনলাইনে নির্দিষ্ট ফি জমা দিয়ে রেজিস্ট্রেশন করতে হবে। পরীক্ষা দেওয়ার কমপক্ষে এক মাস আগে রেজিস্ট্রেশন সম্পন্ন করা জরুরি। বাংলাদেশে পরীক্ষা দেওয়ার জন্য খরচ পড়বে ৯২ ডলার, যা বাংলাদেশি টাকায় প্রায় সাড়ে সাত হাজার টাকা। এ ছাড়া রেজিস্ট্রেশনের জন্য প্রয়োজন হবে পাসপোর্ট এবং পাসপোর্ট সাইজ ছবির ডিজিটাল কপি। এ ক্ষেত্রে উল্লেখ্য যে, পাসপোর্ট ছাড়া অন্য কোনো ধরনের শনাক্তকারী পরিচয়পত্র গ্রহণযোগ্য নয়। রেজিস্ট্রেশন করার পর ওয়েবসাইট থেকে যে প্রবেশপত্র দেওয়া হবে তাতে পরীক্ষার দিন, সময় ও কেন্দ্র উল্লেখ করা থাকবে। পরীক্ষার দিন পরীক্ষার্থীকে প্রয়োজনীয় আরও কী কী নিয়ে যেতে হবে তাও বলা থাকবে প্রবেশপত্রে। বেস্ট অফ লাক অল স্বপ্ন পিপাসু মানুষদের জন্য।",

GREকে জীবনের ধ্যান,জ্ঞান বানায়ে ফেললাম। প্রতিদিন ৭-৮ ঘন্টা পড়াশোনা করেছি। বাজারের মোটামুটি এমন কোন বই নাই যেটা আমি পড়ি নাই। গ্রেকেও ভর্তি হলাম, মানে এবার আর কোন রিস্ক নিতে চাই না। গ্রেকের ফ্যাকাল্টি জিতু ভাই, ক্লাসমেট তন্নী আপু এনারা দুইজন আমাকে খুবই সাহায্য করেছে। লাইফ সাইন্সের স্টুডেন্ট হওয়ার আমি কোয়ান্টে খুবই দুর্বল ছিলাম। যখনই কোন সমস্যায় পড়তাম ওনাদের নক করতাম। ওনারা সলভ করে দিতেন। এর মাঝে ৩ মাস পর মক দিলাম। আশা অনুযায়ী স্কোর আসলো না। যত বই ছিলো, রাগ করে সব ছিড়েখুঁড়ে ফেললাম। সব। ওইদিন রাতে অনেক কান্নাকাটি করলাম। তাহলে GRE কি আমার জন্য না? আমি কি এতই বাজে ছাত্র যে আমার দ্বারা GRE হবে না? আমেরিকায় পড়তে যাবার স্বপ্ন, দুনিয়া ঘুরার স্বপ্ন কি স্বপ্নই থেকে যাবে? পরেরদিন সকালে ঘুম থেকে উঠে আবার নিজেকে বোঝালাম, যে যা হবার হইসে, ছাল ছাড়া যাবে না। GRE এর শেষ দেখেই ছাড়তে হবে। আবার নীলক্ষেত গিয়ে সব বই কিনে আনলাম। আবার পড়াশোনা শুরু। এইবার পড়ার স্পিড আরো বাড়িয়ে দিলাম। দিনে ৮-১০ ঘন্টা পড়তাম। এরপর আবার মক দিলাম ২ মাস পর আশানুরূপ স্কোর পেতে শুরু করলাম। ২০২০ এর ফেব্রুয়ারীর ১০ তারিখ সাহস করে ডেট নিয়ে ফেললাম। এক্সাম দিলাম এবার GRE SCORE ( V-150,Q-157, AWA- 3). আমার টার্গেট ছিলো ৩১০+ যদিও পাইনি তবুও আমি খুশি, লাইফ সাইন্স থেকে আশাকরি মোটামুটি একটা ভার্সিটিতে হয়ে যাবে। তো আর কি, শেষে একটু মোটিভেশাল কথা বলি। আপনি GRE দেয়ার সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়েছেন মানে আপনি অর্ধেক আমেরিকা চলে গেছেন। অনেক ভালো ছাত্ররা GRE দেয়ার সাহস পর্যন্ত করে না। এখন পর্যন্ত আমি এমন কাউকে দেখি নি, যে দেশের বাইরে পড়তে যেতে চেয়েছি কিন্তু পারেনি। হয়তো দেরি হবে, বাট যেতে পারবেন। আজকে নাহয় কালকে, আপনি যাবেনই। আর একটা কথা, হাল ছাড়া যাবে না, কোনদিন না, কখনোই না। জাস্ট কচ্ছপের মতো লেগে থাকুন। কে কি বললো, কানে নেয়ার কিছু নাই। অনেক মানুষ আছে যারা ৩,৪ এমনকি ৫ বার GRE দিয়েছে। এখন আমেরিকাতে আছে। একবার না হলে ১০ বার GRE দেবেন, আমেরিকা যাবেন মানে যাবেনই, সেকেন্ড কোন অপশন নাই VISA INTERVIEW EXPERIENCE: USA A backloggers stroy with 3.09 CGPA and 8 backlogs!

British Council-এ আপনি আগেই আপনার স্পিকিং এর ডেইট নিতে পারবেন নিজের ইচ্ছেমতো কিন্তু IDP-তে আপনি সেটা পারবেন না,এমনকি আপনার স্পিকিং পরীক্ষা কখন হবে সেটা আপনি ৩ দিন আগেও জানতে পারবেন না। (মাঝেমধ্যে জানা যায়) ২. British Council-এ যখন অ্যাপ্লাই করবেন তখন সাথে সাথে একটার পর একটা ইমেইল আসতে থাকবে কোথায় এক্সাম, কত তারিখ এক্সাম, টাকা পেমেন্ট হয়েছে কি না এইসব কিন্তু IDP থেকে শুধু রেজিস্ট্রেশন যে করছেন এই ই-মেইল আসবে,বাকি সবগুলো ইমেইল আসবে পরীক্ষার ২-৩ দিন আগে। ৩. British Council-এ ডুকার আগে হাতে সেনিটাইজার দিবে বারবার, চেক করবে বেশি কিন্তু IDP-তে কম চেক করবে। ৪. British Council-এ একটা কলম, ৩টা পেন্সিল, রাবার, কাটার দিবে কিন্তু IDP-তে দিবে ১টা পেন্সিল, রাবার, কাটার। ৫. British Council-এ এক্সাম দিলে ১ সপ্তাহের ভেতর আপনার সার্টিফিকেট আপনার ঠিকানায় পাঠিয়ে দিবে,অফিস থেকেও কালেক্ট করতে পারবেন কিন্তু IDP-তে তাদের অফিসে গিয়ে আপনার সার্টিফিকেট আনতে হবে। (অনেকে কমেন্টে বলতেছে তারাও নাকি পাঠিয়ে দেয়) ৬. IDP সার্টিফিকেট একবার হারিয়ে গেলে বা নষ্ট হলে আরেকবার ফ্রি-তে দেয়। British Council-এ সম্ভবত এই সুবিধাটা নেই। (সিউর না) মোটামুটি এইগুলো পার্থক্যই আমি দেখতে পেয়েছি। আশা করি, আপনাদের এবার কনফিউশন দূর হবে। Collected.",

However, becoming more dependent on computer has its disadvantages. Discuss threats of computers.” এখানে স্পষ্টই জানতে চাওয়া হচ্ছে কম্পিউটারের উপকারিতা আর অপকারিতা– এই দুই পক্ষ সম্পর্কে। যে পক্ষ আপনার কাছে বেশী যুক্তিযুক্ত মনে হয়, সে পক্ষ সমর্থন করুন এবং বিপরীত পক্ষ নিয়েও উপসংহারের আগে কিছু বলুন। Hidden Argument Based: এ ধরণের টপিকগুলোতে আর্গুমেন্ট লুকানো থাকে। এক্ষেত্রে আপনার কাজ হবে প্রশ্নের মাধ্যমে আসলে কী জানতে চাওয়া হচ্ছে তা উদ্ধার করা এবং সেটাকে ১ নং পয়েন্টের ধাঁচে ফেলে লেখা শুরু করা। এই ধরন আপনি চিনতে পারবেন যদি উল্লেখ করা থাকে এইসব প্রশ্ন “To what extent…?”, “In what way…?”, “How has something changed…?” উদাহরণ: “To what extent should television participate in our children’s education?” এখানে টেস্ট মেকাররা যা জানতে চাচ্ছেন তা হল, শিশুদের শিক্ষিত করার জন্য আদৌ টেলিভিশনের প্রয়োজন আছে কী না। আপনাকে প্রশ্ন থেকে আর্গুমেন্ট ইন্টারপ্রিট করে নিতে হবে এভাবে। * প্রশ্নে “to what extent something affects…?” থাকলে আপনি চিন্তা করবেন, “Does something affect…?” * প্রশ্নে “in what way something contributes?” থাকলে আপনি চিন্তা করবেন, “does something contribute?” * প্রশ্নে “how does something influence…?” থাকলে আপনি চিন্তা করবেন, “does something influence …?” এভাবে চিন্তা করলে দেখবেন যে, দুটো পক্ষ প্রতিষ্ঠা করে ফেলেছেন। এবার আর্গুমেন্ট টপিক যেভাবে লিখতে হয়, সেভাবে রচনা লিখে ফেলুন। Situation Based: এক্ষেত্রে আপনার সামনে একটি পরিস্থিতি উল্লেখ করা হবে। আপনি “পরিস্থিতিটা কী”, “কেন হচ্ছে”, “ভবিষ্যতে কী হতে পারে” ইত্যাদি বয়ান শেষে আপনার সাজেশন/অ্যাডভাইস/রেকমেন্ডেশন উল্লেখ করবেন (যদি চাওয়া হয়)। উদাহরণ: “Due to change of women’s role in modern society, men are now the ones suffering from sexual discrimination. Do you agree?” এখানে একটা পরিস্থিতি উল্লেখ করে আপনার মতামত জানতে চাওয়া হচ্ছে। তাই পক্ষে-বিপক্ষে চিন্তা করে লিখে ফেলুন আপনার মনের কথা। [Ace The IELTS বই হতে অনুপ্রাণিত হয়ে লেখা] © NexTopUSA",

After coming back to home, I take my lunch. In the evening time, I go to play” না লিখে যদি একটু ঘুরিয়ে লিখেন “My school bus picks me up on a daily basis. After returning home, I usually have my lunch around 2 pm and go for playing with friends on the evening”, তাহলেই অন্যদের চেয়ে আলাদা হয়ে গেলেন। ★ টাস্ক ১-এ শতকরা ব্যবহার করতে হবে। টাস্ক-১ এর রাইটিংয়ে ভালো স্কোর তোলার আরেকটা গুরুত্বপূর্ণ পয়েন্ট হল, প্রশ্নে যা লেখা থাকে, সেটাকে শতকরা বা percentage-এ প্রকাশ করা। যেমন, প্রশ্নে উল্লেখ আছে “ঢাকা শহরের মোট জনসংখ্যার (১০০০ জন) মধ্যে ৩০ জন ডাক্তার, ৪০ জন প্রকৌশলী এবং ১০ জন নার্স আছেন। এদের মধ্যে ডাক্তারদের বেতন সবচেয়ে বেশি।” রচনা লেখার সময় এই সংখ্যাগুলোকে আপনি শতকরায় প্রকাশ করে বাক্য গঠন করুন। যেমন, Total 3% of the population is medical doctors in Dhaka city and they enjoy the highest salary if compared with other professions.” প্রশ্ন আসতে পারে, কেন শতকরায় প্রকাশ করতেই হবে? করতে হবে কারণ প্রশ্নে যেভাবে তথ্য উল্লখে করা থাকে, তাকে সরাসরি উঠিয়ে দিলে মার্কস ভালো আসবে না। ঐ তথ্যকে নতুনভাবে প্রকাশ করতে হবে। একইভাবে, প্রশ্নে কোনো তথ্য শতকরায় উল্লেখ করা থাকলে আপনি সেটাকে পূর্ণ সংখ্যায় প্রকাশ করে লিখুন। ★ Phrase ব্যবহার করতে হবে। বিভিন্ন ডাইরেকশন বুঝাতে অবশ্যই Phrase ব্যবহার করবেন। যেমন: রাইটিং টাস্ক-১ এর গ্রাফে যদি দেখা যায় কোনোকিছু দ্রুতগতিতে বৃদ্ধি পেয়েছে, তাহলে increase, rise up-এর বদলে লিখতে পারেন uplifted, rocketed, upsurged; খুবই দ্রুতগতিতে বৃদ্ধি পেলে ভার্বের আগে sharply, dramatically ইত্যাদি adjective বসান; ধীরে ধীরে বৃদ্ধি পেলে gradually, slowly ইত্যাদি adjective বসান; যদি সাম্যাবস্থায় চলে আসে তাহলে stabilized, leveled off ইত্যাদি; কমলে/হ্রাস পেলে decrease/fell down-এর পরিবর্তে dropped, plummeted ইত্যাদি লিখতে পারেন। এরকম আরও অনেক প্রতিশব্দ (synonyms) আছে, যেগুলো আপনাকে মনে রাখতে হবে। এগুলো টাস্ক-১ আর টাস্ক-২, দুটোর জন্যেই জরুরি। আর প্র্যাকটিস হল মনে রাখার সবচেয়ে সহজ উপায়। আমি এসব শব্দ ঝাড়া মুখস্ত করিনি। বরং বিভিন্ন বিষয়ের উপর যখন আর্টিকেল লেখা প্র্যাকটিস করতাম, তখন একেক আর্টিকেলে একেক ধরনের শব্দ ব্যবহার করতাম। এভাবে অনেক শব্দ মাথায় গেঁথে গিয়েছিলো। আর পরীক্ষায় যেহেতু মাত্র দুটো আর্টিকেল লিখতে হয়, তাই আমার মাথায় জমা হওয়া অনেকগুলো Phrase থেকে সুযোগ বুঝে বেস্ট Phrase-টা ব্যবহার করতে পেরেছিলাম। ★ রাইটিং টাস্ক-২ তে প্রাসঙ্গিক উদাহরণ টানতে হবে। ধরুন, আপনাকে টপিক দেওয়া হল “Nowadays internet is helpful to store huge amount of information”। এই স্টেইটমেন্টের ব্যাপারে আপনার মতামত জানতে চাওয়া হল। আপনি এর পক্ষে, বিপক্ষে কিংবা নিরপেক্ষ অবস্থানে থেকে আপনার মতামত দিতে পারেন। তো, আপনি পক্ষে লিখতে চাচ্ছেন। এজন্য একটা উদাহরণ টানলেন এভাবে, “Even before the 90’s, when internet was not so available to the populous, paper was the only way for the multitude to store information. But as the technology develops/prospers, many divergent devices are seen to be used as a storage of information, such as compact disc, floppy disc, pen drive, hard disc etc. However, these gadgets have their limits. Some have only 64 gigabyte memory, some up-to 2 terabyte. But internet, literally, knows no boundary. We can stock limitless data here.” এই উদাহরণ দিয়ে কি আপনার পক্ষকে আরও শক্তিশালী করলেন না? এভাবে দৈনন্দিন জীবন থেকে প্রাসঙ্গিক উদাহরণ দিতে হবে। তিনটা, চারটা উদাহরণ দিলে ভালো। উদাহরণটির মাধ্যমে আমি বেশ কিছু পয়েন্ট তুলে ধরেছি। যেমন, প্রথম লাইনে দেখুন কমার মাঝখানে একটা খণ্ড বাক্য জুড়ে দিয়ে পুরো বাক্যকে জটিল বানিয়েছি। People-এর পরিবর্তে populous আর multitude বসিয়েছি। Different-এর বদলে divergent, store-এর বদলে stock, information-এর বদলে data বসিয়েছি। এছাড়া However আর knows no boundary বসিয়ে বাক্যকে সুন্দর করেছি। এভাবে সুযোগ বুঝে বিভিন্ন phrase; nevertheless, nonetheless, although ইত্যাদি শব্দ ব্যবহার করবেন। ★ গ্রামার ১০০% ঠিক রেখে লিখতে হবে। একটা বাক্য লিখতে গিয়ে যদি verb-এ গণ্ডগোল করেন, বা gerund/tense ইত্যাদিতে ভুল করেন, স্বাভাবিকভাবেই স্কোর কমে যাবে। তাই যখন বাসায় প্র্যাকটিস করবেন, চেষ্টা করবেন ইংরেজি গ্রামারে দক্ষ কাউকে দিয়ে লেখাগুলো চেক করিয়ে নিতে। অথবা Grammarly app ব্যবহার করতে পারেন। ★ বানান ঠিক রাখতে হবে। এটা খুবই গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। একটা ভালো লেখা মুহূর্তে নষ্ট হয়ে যেতে পারে বানান ভুলের কারণে। ★ শব্দ সংখ্যা সঠিক রাখতে হবে। IELTS এর টাস্ক-১ এর জন্য মিনিমাম রেঞ্জ দেওয়া থাকে ১৫০ শব্দ, আর টাস্ক-২ এর জন্য ২৫০ শব্দ। অবশ্যই এর চেয়ে বেশি লিখুন, সমস্যা হবে না কোনো। কিন্তু কম লেখা যাবে না, নাম্বার কাটা যাবে। ★ ক্ষেত্রবিশেষে Passive voice ব্যবহার করতে হবে। সবসময় “I did this job, He introduces his mother to me” ধরনের Active voice না লিখে “That job was done by me, His mother was introduced by him” ধরনের Passive voice লেখা দরকার। এতে লেখায় বৈচিত্র্য আসে, আর বৈচিত্র্য মানেই বেশি নাম্বার পাওয়ার সুযোগ! ★ প্রবাদ/উক্তি ব্যবহার করতে হবে। এই পয়েন্টটা অপশনাল। চাইলে প্রয়োগ ঘটাতে পারেন, না চাইলে নাই। সবসময় প্রবাদ, প্রবচন, উক্তি লেখার মত পরিস্থিতি তৈরি হয় না। সুযোগ আসলে যদি একটা দুটো লিখতে পারেন, বেস্ট! যেমন: Necessity is the mother of invention, আইনস্টাইনের উক্তি ‘Imagination is more important than knowledge’ ইত্যাদি হরেক রকমের বাক্য আপনি অলংকার হিসেবে রচনায় ঢুকাতে পারেন। © NexTopUSA",

In the ten hours prior to the Titanic’s fatal collision with an iceberg at 11.40pm, six warnings of icebergs in her path were received by the Titanic’s wireless operators. Only one of these messages was formally posted on the bridge; the others were in various locations across the ship. If the combined information in these messages of iceberg positions had been plotted, the ice field which lay across the Titanic’s path would have been apparent. Instead, the lack of formal procedures for dealing with information from a relatively new piece of technology, the wireless, meant that the danger was not known until too late. This was not the fault of the Titanic crew. Procedures for dealing with warnings received through the wireless had not been formalized across the shipping industry at the time. The fact that the wireless operators were not even Titanic crew, but rather contracted workers from a wireless company, made their role in the ship’s operation quite unclear. i) Faulty design ii) Iceberg locations not plotted iii) Inadequate training সঠিক উত্তর হবে ii, কারণ পুরো প্যাসেজের মূলভাব ছিল আইসবার্গের অস্তিত্ব সম্পর্কে ওয়ার্নিং পাওয়া সত্ত্বেও সেই মেসেজ ঠিকমতো ডেলিভার করা হয়নি। ফলে এই সংঘাত হয়েছিলো। ডেলিভার করলে আইসবার্গের অবস্থান “plot (চিহ্নিত)” করা যেত। আর কেন সঠিকভাবে ডেলিভার করা হয়নি, সে বিষয়েও অনেক কথা বলা হয়েছে। কিন্তু সেটার উপর ভিত্তি করে কোনো হেডিং দেওয়া হয়নি। আপনি যদি মূলভাব না ধরতে পারে, তাহলে “Inadequate training/ Faulty design”-কে সঠিক এন্সার মনে করতে পারেন। কিন্তু দেখুন, প্যারার কোথাও কিন্তু ট্রেনিং বা জাহাজের ডিজাইন সম্পর্কে কিছু বলেনি। ২) true/false/not given: মানুষ সবচেয়ে বেশি সমস্যায় পড়ে false/not given নিয়ে। কোনটা যে false, আর কোনটা যে not given, সেটাই অনেক সময় প্যাঁচ লেগে যায়। মনে রাখবেন, প্যাসেজে যা একদমই বলা হয়নি, সেটা not given হবে। অর্থাৎ not given ইনফরমেশনগুলি আলটপকা বাইরে থেকে এনে প্রশ্নে ঢুকানো হয়। কিন্তু প্রশ্নে অনেক সময় এমনভাবে কিছু মিথ্যা পয়েন্ট উল্লেখ করা হয়, যেটা পড়লে আপনার মনে হবে, প্যাসেজেও এই বিষয়ে লেখা আছে। এগুলোই false। ব্যাপারটা বুঝার জন্য আমি একটা প্যাসেজ দিচ্ছি। পড়ে নিচের পয়েন্টগুলোর মধ্যে কোনটা true/false/not given, বের করুন। When it opened in 1843 the Thames Tunnel was described as the English Wonder of the World. People came from far and wide to see the first tunnel under a river. On the first day, fifty thousand people descended the staircase and paid a penny to walk through the tunnel. By the end of the first three months there were a million people, or half the population of London. This was the most successful visitor attraction in the world. In the age of sail and horse-drawn coaches, people came long distances and bought souvenirs and listened to the entertainment in the cross-tunnel arches. The idea, of course, was not entertainment but to move cargo and turn a profit. People were drawn from all over to see the Thames Tunnel. People were able to travel by sea or land in those days. Statues of the tunnel could be purchased as souvenirs. The aim of building the tunnel was make money as a tourist attraction. এখানে দেখুন, প্রথম প্রশ্নে যা জানতে চাচ্ছে, সেটা প্যাসেজের দ্বিতীয় লাইনে বলে দেওয়া আছে। সুতরাং এটা true । দ্বিতীয় প্রশ্নে যা জানতে চাচ্ছে, সেটা আছে প্যাসেজের ৬ নাম্বার লাইনে। এটাও true । তৃতীয় প্রশ্নে যা জানতে চাচ্ছে, সেটা প্যাসেজের কোথাও উল্লেখ নেই। প্যাসেজে শুধুমাত্র সুভেনিরের কথা বলা আছে। কিন্তু কোথাও বলা নেই, টানেলের মূর্তিগুলোকে সুভেনির হিসেবে কেনা যেত কিনা। টানেলের মূর্তির কথা একেবারে আলটপকা এনে বসিয়ে দেওয়া হয়েছে, Right? তাই এটা not given । এরপর দেখেন চতুর্থ প্রশ্ন। এখানে যা জানতে চাচ্ছে, সেটার সাথে মিল আছে প্যাসেজের শেষ লাইনের। কিন্তু শেষ লাইনে কী বলা আছে? বলা আছে, টানেলটা তৈরি করা হয়েছিলো মালামাল বহনের মাধ্যমে টাকা পয়সা লাভ করার জন্য। কিন্তু প্রশ্নে কথাটাকে ঘুরিয়ে বলা হল, টানেল তৈরির লক্ষ্য ছিল পর্যটক আকর্ষণ করা। তো, কী বুঝলেন? প্রশ্নটা false। © NexTopUSA",

Recording-1: a conversation between two people set in an everyday social context. Recording-2: a monologue set in an everyday social context, e.g. a speech about local facilities. Recording-3: a conversation between up to four people set in an educational or training context, e.g. a university tutor and a student discussing an assignment. Recording-4: a monologue on an academic subject, e.g. a university lecture. In the end, you will get 10 minutes to transfer your answers to an answer sheet. ★READING *Duration: 60 minutes The Reading component consists of 40 questions, designed to test a wide range of reading skills. These include reading for gist, reading for main ideas, reading for detail, skimming, understanding logical argument and recognizing writers’ opinions, attitudes and purpose. *IELTS Academic test– This includes three long texts which range from the descriptive and factual to the discursive and analytical. These are taken from books, journals, magazines and newspapers. They have been selected for a non-specialist audience but are appropriate for people entering university courses or seeking professional registration. ★WRITING *Duration: 60 minutes Topics are of general interest to, and suitable for, test takers entering undergraduate and postgraduate studies or seeking professional registration. There are two tasks: *Task-1: You will be presented with a graph, table, chart or diagram and asked to describe, summarize or explain the information in your own words. You may be asked to describe and explain data, describe the stages of a process, how something works or describe an object or event. *Task-2: You will be asked to write an essay in response to a point of view, argument or problem. Responses to both tasks must be in a formal style. ★SPEAKING *Duration: 11-14 minutes The speaking component assesses your use of spoken English. Every test is recorded. *Part-1: The examiner will ask you general questions about yourself and a range of familiar topics, such as home, family, work, studies and interests. This part lasts between four and five minutes. *Part-2: You will be given a card which asks you to talk about a particular topic. You will have one minute to prepare before speaking for up to two minutes. The examiner will then ask one or two questions on the same topic. *Part-3: You will be asked further questions about the topic in Part 2. These will give you the opportunity to discuss more abstract ideas and issues. This part of the test lasts between four and five minutes.",

      "content_clean": "লিসেনিং সেকশনে চারটা পার্ট থাকে। চার পার্টে ছয় ধরনের প্রশ্ন আসতে পারে। যেমন, Fill in the gap, MCQ, select correct answers, diagram matching, map fill up ইত্যাদি। আপনি যদি সবগুলো পার্ট সম্পর্কে বিস্তারিত জ্ঞান রাখেন, তাহলে প্রস্তুতি নেওয়া অনেক সহজ হয়ে যায়। এখানে আবারও একটা রিমাইন্ডার দিতে চাই। প্রতিটা পার্টের রেকর্ডিং শোনার আগে অল্প যেটুকু সময় হাতে থাকে, সেটুকু সময়ের মধ্যে উক্ত পার্টের প্রশ্নগুলো যতটা সম্ভব মাথায় গেঁথে নিবেন। এতে করে কনভারসেশন শোনার সময় দিমাগ কি বাত্তি জ্বলে উঠবে। প্রতিটা সেকশানে কয়েকটা করে গ্রুপ থাকে। যেমন, সেকশান ওয়ানের ১ এবং ২ নাম্বার প্রশ্ন নিয়ে একটা গ্রুপ থাকতে পারে, এবং ৩-১০ নাম্বার প্রশ্ন নিয়ে থাকতে পারে আরেকটা গ্রুপ। গ্রুপ আলাদা হয় কারণ প্রতিটা গ্রুপের প্রশ্নের ধরন আলাদা হয়। ধরা যাক, ১-২ প্রশ্নের যে গ্রুপ আছে, সেটার প্রশ্নের ধরন Multiple choice questions; আর ৩-১০ প্রশ্নের যে গ্রুপ আছে, সেটার প্রশ্নের ধরন Short-answer Question। আপনার অন্যতম কাজ হল, সব ধরনের প্রশ্ন সম্পর্কে সম্যক ধারণা লাভ করা। এর একমাত্র উপায় বই থেকে মক টেস্ট সল্ভ করা। ক্যাম্ব্রিজের ৮-১৬ বইতে মোটামুটি সব ধরনের প্রশ্নই অন্তর্ভুক্ত করা হয়েছে। প্রতিটা আলাদা গ্রুপের জন্য আলাদা কথোপকথন শোনানো হয়। তবে কথোপকথন শুরুর আগে ইন্সট্রাকশন দেওয়া হয়। বলা হয়, কত নাম্বার থেকে কত নাম্বার পর্যন্ত প্রশ্নের উত্তর এখন আপনাকে দিতে হবে, এবং কীভাবে উত্তর দিতে হবে। শূন্যস্থান পূরণ করবেন না কি তথ্য ম্যাচ করবেন ইত্যাদি। সেকশান ওয়ান শেষ হলে আপনাকে আধা মিনিট সময় দেওয়া হবে প্রশ্নের উত্তর চেক করার জন্য। এভাবে প্রতিটা সেকশন শেষে সময় দেওয়া হয়। মনে রাখবেন, রেকর্ডিং শুনতে শুনতে আপনাকে সব উত্তর প্রশ্নপত্রে টুকে রাখতে হবে। যখন রেকর্ড শুনবেন, তখন কিছু বিষয়ের দিকে খেয়াল রাখবেন। এসব বিষয়ের সাথে সম্পর্কিত তথ্যগুলো সম্ভাব্য উত্তর হতে পারে। যেমন: কোনো শব্দের উপর জোর (accent) দেওয়া হচ্ছে কি না। কোনো শব্দ দুইবার বলা হল কি না। কোনো শব্দ বানান করে বলা হল কি না। টেলিফোন নাম্বার, বাসার ঠিকানা, অফিসের ঠিকানাসহ যেকোনো ঠিকানা। যেকোনো প্রতিষ্ঠান বন্ধ এবং খোলার সময়। সপ্তাহের কোন কোন দিন খোলা থাকে, কবে বন্ধ থাকে ইত্যাদি তথ্য। সবগুলো পার্টের জন্য সবচেয়ে উপকারী কৌশল হল, সময়/তারিখ/ঠিকানা/সংখ্যা/ফোন নাম্বার শোনার সাথে সাথে প্রশ্নপত্রে টুকে নেওয়া। আপনি যখন রেকর্ড শুনছেন, তখন পুরো মনোযোগ শোনার দিকে থাকতে হবে। ফলে প্রশ্ন যদি আগে পড়েও থাকেন, তবুও শোনায় ব্যস্ত থাকার কারণে প্রশ্নগুলো মনে পড়ার ক্ষেত্রে সমস্যা হতে পারে। তাই এসব তথ্য লিখে ফেলাই ভালো। পরে প্রশ্নের উত্তর দিতে গিয়ে যেগুলো লাগবে, সেগুলো টুকে নেওয়া তথ্য দেখে লিখে ফেলতে পারবেন। দুয়েকটা তথ্য বেশি লিখলে কোনও ক্ষতি নেই। কিন্তু না-লেখার ফলে যদি দুয়েকটা প্রশ্নের উত্তর মিস করে যান, সেটা ভুগাবে আগামী দুই বছর। IELTS-এ একটা কথা আছে, “Last word counts”। অর্থাৎ আগে কে কী বললো, সেটা গোনার দরকার নেই। শেষে যে যা বলল, সেটাই সঠিক উত্তর। আরেকটু ভেঙ্গে বলি। অনেক সময় দেখবেন, একজন একটা বিষয়ে কোনো তথ্য দিলো, একটু পর সেই তথ্যটি “সঠিক নয়” ঘোষণা দিয়ে “সঠিক” তথ্যটি বলল। সুতরাং আপনার সঠিক উত্তর হবে শেষেরটা। এভাবে অনেক কারেকশনই দেওয়া হয় “আলাপচারিতা”-র মাঝে। তারমানে এই না, আপনি কারেকশনের জন্য বসে থাকবেন। আপনি যখন যেটা শুনছেন, সেটা লিখে ফেলবেন। কিন্তু আপনাকে কারেকশনের জন্যেও অস্ত্র হাতে তৈয়ার থাকতে হবে। কারেকশন দিলেই যেন আগের শব্দটা কেটে সঠিক শব্দটা বসিয়ে নিতে পারেন। চার পার্ট শোনার পর যখন ১০ মিনিট সময় দেওয়া হবে উত্তরপত্রে উত্তর উঠানোর জন্য, তখন ভালোমতো চোখ রগড়ে দেখে নিবেন কী নির্দেশনা দেওয়া আছে। যদি প্রশ্নে উল্লেখ করা থাকে, Write NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER for each answer, আপনাকে অবশ্যই তিনটি শব্দের মধ্যে অথবা একটি সংখ্যার মধ্যে উত্তর আটকে ফেলতে হবে। তিন শব্দের বেশি লিখলে বা একাধিক সংখ্যা লিখলে আপনার স্কোর হবে শুন্য! তবে এক বা দুই শব্দে উত্তর দিলে কোনো সমস্যা নেই। শুধু তিন শব্দের বেশি যাওয়া যাবে না। * উত্তর CAPITAL LETTER দিয়ে লিখেন, আর Small letter দিয়ে লিখেন, সমস্যা নেই। শুধু খেয়াল রাখবেন, যখন উত্তর হিসেবে NOUN লিখবেন, তখন অবশ্যই CAPITAL LETTER দিয়ে নামটা শুরু করবেন। এক্ষেত্রে Small letter দিয়ে লিখলে উত্তর ভুল হিসেবে গণ্য হবে। উত্তর Common Noun হলে সেটা Plural দিলেও চলে, Singular দিলেও চলে। যেমন, উত্তর যদি coast/fish/bird হয়, তবে coasts/fishes/birds লিখলেও সমস্যা নেই। কিন্তু Proper noun হলে যা বলেছে, সেটাই লিখতে হবে। যেমন, East coast বললে আপনি লিখতে পারবেন না East coasts। * উত্তর হিসেবে অনেক সময় প্রতিশব্দও গ্রহণ করা হয়। যেমন, আলাপে বা বক্তৃতায় যদি garbage উচ্চারণ করা হয়, আর আপনি যদি উত্তরে waste বা rubbish লিখেন, তাহলেও সেটা সঠিক উত্তর হবে। অনেক সময় আমাদের মাথায় থাকে না, একজ্যাক্টলি কোন শব্দটা বলা হয়েছিল। তখন synonym ব্যবহার করা যেতে পারে। তবে সেইফ সাইডে থাকার জন্য আলাপে যা বলেছে, সেটা দেওয়াই সবচেয়ে ভালো। পার্ট ১-এ সাধারণত দুজন ব্যক্তির মধ্যে কথোপকথন থাকে। এই আলাপচারিতা হতে পারে কোনো ক্লাবের রিসিপশনিস্টের সাথে সম্ভাব্য মেম্বারের, জাদুঘরের কিউরেটরের সাথে সম্ভাব্য দর্শনার্থীর, বাস/ট্রেন/প্লেনের কোনো অফিসারের সাথে সম্ভাব্য যাত্রীর, বা এই ধরনের কিছু। এখানে সময়, তারিখ, ঠিকানা, যিনি ফোন করেছেন তার ব্যক্তিগত তথ্য, যে জিনিস সম্পর্কে জানার জন্য ফোন করা হয়েছে সে সম্পর্কে তথ্য নিয়ে প্রশ্ন থাকে। প্রশ্নের ধরন বেশীরভাগই হয় ফর্ম ফিলাপ লেয়াউটের। লিসেনিং সেকশনের প্রথম পার্টটা হয় সবচেয়ে সোজা, ক্রমান্বয়ে পার্টগুলো কঠিন হতে থাকে। প্রশ্নের সংখ্যা সাধারণত সবগুলো পার্টেই ১০ টা করে মোট ৪০ টা থাকে। পার্ট ২ এবং ৩-তে ম্যাপ/ডায়াগ্রাম ম্যাচিং/কয়েকজন ব্যক্তির মধ্যে কথোপকথন থাকতে পারে। ম্যাপ বেশ সোজা। ম্যাপের ক্ষেত্রে কণ্ঠ যা বলছে, আপনি সে অনুযায়ী ম্যাপের মধ্যে পেন্সিল দিয়ে দাগাতে থাকবেন। না-দাগালে হঠাৎ করে বুঝা যায় না, ঠিক কোন পয়েন্ট নিয়ে বক্তা কথা বলছেন। পেন্সিল ব্যবহার করে যখন প্রশ্নের উত্তরে এসে পড়বেন, তখন সেটা বুঝা সহজ হয়। তবে সবার জন্য এই কৌশল নাও খাটতে পারে। *ডায়াগ্রাম ম্যাচিং: এক্ষেত্রে যদি কোনো প্রসেসের ডায়াগ্রাম আসে, তাহলে একই কৌশল অবলম্বন করা যায়। কারণ IELTS-এর একটা সুবিধা হল, এরা সিরিয়াল অনুযায়ী প্রশ্ন করে। হুট করে মাঝে বা শেষে ঢুকে পড়বে না। প্রসেসের শুরু থেকে শেষ পর্যন্ত বলতে বলতে আসবে। ফলে পেন্সিল দিয়ে সিরিয়াল অনুযায়ী ডায়াগ্রামে দাগাতে দাগাতেই উত্তর পেয়ে যাওয়ার কথা। কিন্তু শুধু প্রসেসই তো আসে না, আসে হরেক রকমের ডায়াগ্রাম। তাই চেষ্টা করবেন প্র্যাকটিস বুক থেকে সব ধরনের ডায়াগ্রাম সমাধান করে, সবগুলোর উপর দক্ষ হয়ে তারপর হলে যেতে। *কনভারসেশান: দুইয়ের অধিক ব্যক্তির মধ্যে (সাধারণত দেখা যায়, দুজন স্টুডেন্ট তাদের অ্যাডভাইজরের সাথে রিসার্চ টপিক নিয়ে আলোচনা করছে বা পড়াশোনার উন্নতি/অবনতি নিয়ে আলাপ করছে) কথা হলে উত্তর বের করা একটু কঠিন। তবে প্র্যাকটিসের মাধ্যমে যেকোনো ব্যাপারেই দক্ষ হওয়া যায়, ভয় নেই। এক্ষেত্রে আমি বলবো, কনভারসেশন শোনার আগে যতটুকু সম্ভব প্রশ্নগুলো মাথায় ঢুকিয়ে ফেলতে। এতে করে উত্তর ট্র্যাক করা একটু সহজ হবে। পার্ট ৪-এ সাধারণত একজন বক্তার বক্তৃতা থাকে। এই বক্তৃতা বেশিরভাগ সময়েই হয়ে থাকে সায়েন্টিফিক কোনো টপিকের উপর, অনেক সময় থাকে আর্টস বা অন্যান্য বিষয়। এই সেকশানটাই সবচেয়ে জটিল। বক্তা এতো বেশি তথ্য দেবেন যে, কোনটা রেখে কোনটা টুকবেন, দিশা পাবেন না। তবে হ্যালো! বলেছি না প্র্যাকটিস করতে করতে intuition জন্মায়? এখানে আপনার intuition অনেক কাজে দেবে। আর প্রশ্ন যেহেতু সিরিয়াল অনুযায়ী হয়, তাই আমি বক্তৃতার সিরিয়াল অনুযায়ী প্রশ্নের সিরিয়াল মিলিয়ে উত্তর বের করায় দক্ষ হয়ে গিয়েছিলাম। আমি পারলে আপনি কেন পারবেন না, বলুন? আরেকটা বিষয়! MCQ প্রশ্নের ক্ষেত্রে দেখা যায়, তিনটা অপশানের তিনটাই সঠিক আন্সার বলে মনে হয়। কারণ তিনটা সম্পর্কেই আপনি বলতে শুনেছেন। এক্ষেত্রে আপনারা নিজেদের সুবিধার জন্য ম্যাপ/ফ্লোচার্ট তৈরি করে নিতে পারেন। যে আলাপ বা বক্তৃতাটা শুনছেন, সেটা শুনতে শুনতে পেপারে একটা ম্যাপ/ফ্লোচার্ট এঁকে ফেলতে পারেন। বক্তা হয়তো একটা বিষয়ে কথা শুরু করে আরও অনেক ডালপালা গজিয়ে ফেললো। আপনি সবকিছুই শর্টকাটে লিখে ফেলবেন। এতে করে প্রশ্নের আন্সার খোঁজা সহজ হবে। মনে রাখবেন, কোনো উত্তর মিস করলে মিস। ব্যস! ওটা নিয়ে আর ভাববেন না, প্লিজ। ওটা নিয়ে ভাবলে বাকিগুলোও আর দেখতে হবে না। যদি রেকর্ডিং শেষ হবার পর হাতে সময় থাকে, উত্তরটা নিয়ে ভাবতে বসুন। কিন্তু রেকর্ডিংয়ের মাঝে এই কাজ করবেন না। আবার ভাবতে গিয়ে প্রশ্নপত্রে উত্তর লেখার সময় যাতে ফুরিয়ে না যায়, প্রিয় পাঠক! সবদিক সামলে। বি:দ্র: আমি “সাধারণত” শব্দটা ব্যবহার করেছি কারণ এই ধরনগুলো ধ্রুব সত্য নয়। এগুলো পরিবর্তিত হতে পারে। ধন্যবাদ!",

      "content_clean": "আমার ফেসবুক ম্যাসেঞ্জারে প্রায়ই একটি ম্যাসেজ আসে, সালাম ভাই/স্যার, জাপানে আসতে চাই, আপনার পরামর্শ দরকার, একটু কথা বলা যাবে? প্রেরক আমার দেশের ছোট ভাই-বোনেরা। আমি চেষ্টা করি প্রতিটি ম্যাসেজের উত্তর দিতে, তবে মাঝে মাঝে একটু বিপদে পড়ে যাই, কারণ প্রশ্নকর্তা নিজেই জানেন না তার কী পরামর্শ দরকার। আমি প্রশ্ন-উত্তর করে কিছু পরামর্শ দিচ্ছি। ১। প্রশ্ন: জাপানে বাংলাদেশীদের পড়াশুনার সুযোগ কেমন? উত্তর: জাপানের জনসংখ্যা বৃদ্ধির হার বেশ কয়েক বছর ধরে নেগেটিভ, ফলে ওদের অনেক বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় ছাত্রছাত্রী সংকটে পড়ছে এবং বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলো চেষ্টা করছে বিদেশীদের দিয়ে শুন্যস্থান পূরন করতে। বুঝতেই পারছেন বিদেশীদের সুযোগ দিনদিন বাড়ছে এবং পৃথিবীর অন্যান্য দেশের মতো বাংলাদেশীদের সুযোগও বাড়ছে। ২। প্রশ্ন: জাপানে দিনদিন বাংলাদেশী স্টুডেন্টদের সংখ্যা কমছে কেন? উত্তর: এটার সঠিক উত্তর আমার জানা নেই তবে নিজের একান্ত ভাবনা থেকে কিছুটা ধারণা দেবার চেষ্টা করব। জাপানে উচ্চশিক্ষা গ্রহণে সবচেয়ে আগ্রহী দেশ কোনটি, জানেন?….. চায়না অথচ বেশীরভাগ চাইনিজরা কিন্ত জাপানীজদের ঘৃণা করে অতীত ইতিহাসের কারণে। দ্বিতীয় দেশটি হচ্ছে ভিয়েতনাম। চাইনিজদের সুবিধা হচ্ছে ওদের ভাষাগত মিল, কথা বলতে না-পারলেও পড়তে আর লিখতে খুব একটা সমস্যা হয় না। চাইনিজরা মেধাবী এবং জাপানে পড়ার ব্যাপারে অনেক সিনসিয়ার, বেশীরভাগ চাইনিজ স্টুডেন্ট জাপানে আসার আগেই জাপানীজ ল্যাংগুয়েজে পারদর্শী হয়ে যায়। ভিয়েতনামের ক্ষেত্রেও তাই, ওরাও বেশ সিনসিয়ার জাপানে পড়ার ব্যাপারে। আর একটি বিষয় জাপনীজদের স্বার্থ, চীন/ভিয়েতনামে এই মূহুর্তে জাপানের হাজার হাজার কোম্পানি কাজ করছে এবং জাপান ফেরত স্টুডেন্টরা তাদের জন্য বিরাট আশীর্বাদ। আমাদের দেশের অনেকেই জাপানে আসতে চায় তবে কেউ কষ্ট করতে রাজি নয়। আমি নিজের আত্বীয়স্বজন সহ অনেককেই দেখেছি, বসে থাকে তাকে কেউ নিয়ে যাবে অথবা কিছু টাকা দিয়ে জাপানে চলে আসবে। আমেরিকা কানাডা যাওয়ার জন্য IELTS/GRE করতে পারবে তবে জাপানে আসার জন্য জাপানীজ N3/N4 করতে ইচ্ছুক নয়। বাংলাদেশে জাপানীজ কোম্পানি খুব একটা নেই তাই বাংলাদেশী স্টুডেন্ট বাড়ানোর ব্যাপারে জাপান সরকারেরও তেমন কোন উৎসাহ নেই। স্টুডেন্ট বাড়ানোর জন্য বাংলাদেশ সরকারের কোন ভূমিকাও নেই, তবে রিসেন্টলি বাংলাদেশ সরকার কাজ করছে সরকারের কর্মচারীদের বৃত্তির সংখ্যা বাড়ানোর ব্যাপারে এবং বেশ সফলও হয়েছে। তবে জনগনের জন্য কেউ নেই। ওহ আছে, দালাল ঢাকার অলিতে গলিতে জাপানীজ ল্যাংগুয়েজ স্কুল খোলে চটকদার বিজ্ঞাপন দিয়ে পকেট কাটছে। ৩। প্রশ্ন: জাপানে আসতে হলে কী করতে হবে? উত্তর: আগে নিজেকে প্রশ্ন করেন, জাপানে কেন আসতে চান? শুধু উচ্চশিক্ষা না কি জাপানে ক্যারিয়ার গড়তে? বেশীরভাগেরই উত্তর হবে ক্যারিয়ার!! তবে উত্তর যা-ই হউক আপনাকে জাপানীজ ল্যাংগুয়েজ শিখেই আসতে হবে। কতটুকু শিখতে হবে? আমি রিকমেন্ড করবো মিনিমাম N3, তাহলে আপনার জাপানে আসা কেউ ঠেকাতে পারবে না, আসার পর উচ্চশিক্ষা, ক্যারিয়ার নিয়েও কোন চিন্তা করতে হবে না। অনেকেই বলতে পারেন অমুক বড়ভাই তো গেছে। আমিও জানি অনেকেই এসেছে বা আসবে তবে তাদের বেশীরভাগই ক্যারিয়ার নিয়ে সমস্যায় পড়েছে এবং এক সময় জাপান ছেড়ে অন্য দেশে চলে গেছে। সফলতার কোন সর্টকাট রাস্তা নেই। জাপানে আসতে চাইলে, কাল নয় আজ থেকেই ভাষা শিখুন। ৪। প্রশ্ন: কোন ধরনের ডিগ্রির জন্য জাপান ভালো? উত্তর: যেকোনও সাবজেক্টেই আন্ডারগ্রাজুয়েট/মাস্টার্স/পিএইচডি প্রোগ্রামে আসা যায় এবং পড়াশুনা শেষে জাপানীজ ল্যাংগুয়েজ জানা জাপানে থাকলে জব প্রাপ্তি নিশ্চিত। দিনশেষে কথা কিন্তু একটাই, জাপানীজ ল্যাংগুয়েজ! ৫। প্রশ্ন: জাপানে বৃত্তি না পেলে পার্ট টাইম জব করে প্রাইভেটে কি পড়াশুনা করা সম্ভব? উত্তর: সম্ভব, যদি আপনি জাপানীজ ল্যাংগুয়েজে কমিউনিকেশন করতে পারেন। আর যদি সেটা না-হয় তাহলে জীবন অনেক কঠিন হয়ে যাবে। ৬। প্রশ্ন: জাপানের কোন বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে পড়ব, কীভাবে যোগাযোগ করব? উত্তর: জাপানে শতশত বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় আছে, বেশীরভাগই গ্রহণযোগ্য। মনবসু পেলে কোনও কথা নেই তবে প্রাইভেট/নিজ খরচে পড়তে গেলে জাপানের উপরের দিকে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোতে সুযোগ পাওয়া কঠিন, তাই আমার সাজেশন টোকিও এর বাহিরে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোতে চেষ্টা করার। সব বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের ওয়েবসাইট আছে, এবং ওয়েবসাইটে ভর্তির ব্যাপারে যাবতীয় তথ্য আছে। ইন্টারনেট থেকে তথ্য নিয়ে পছন্দের বিশ্ববিদ্যালযয়ের লিস্ট করুন, ওদের ভর্তির জন্য রিকোয়ারমেনট দেখুন, না-বুঝলে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়কে ই-মেইল করুন। তবে মেইল করার সময় খেয়াল করবেন আপনার লেখা যেন নির্ভুল হয় এবং কী জানতে চাচ্ছেন সেটা যেন পরিষ্কার বুঝা যায়। ওয়েবসাইটে ভালো করে দেখে নিন আপনি যা জানতে চাচ্ছেন তা ওয়েবসাইটে আছে কি না, যদি থাকে তাহলে সেটা নিয়ে প্রশ্ন করবেন না। মনস্থির করুন, জাপানে কেন আসতে চান, কীভাবে আসতে চান, সময় নিন, ধাপে ধাপে নিজেকে যোগ্য করে তুলুন, দেখবেন জাপান আপনাকেই ডাকছে… Good luck and all the best wishes for you. © লিংকন, প্রিন্সিপাল সাইন্টিস্ট।",

      "content_clean": "উচ্চ শিক্ষা অনেকের কাছে স্বপ্নের ও ধরাছোঁয়ার বাইরে মনে হতে পারে। তবে বিশ্বাস করেন, আপনি চাইলে অনেক কিছুই করতে পারেন। আপনার কাঙ্ক্ষিত স্বপ্নের কাছে পৌঁছাতে আবার স্বপ্ন থেকে নিজেকে হারিয়ে ফেলতে। আপনি হয়তো ভুলে গেছেন যে, এইচএসসি পাশের পর ভালো একটা ভার্সিটিতে নিজেকে জায়গা করে নিতে কত কিছুই ছাড় দিয়েছেন! নিজের দৃঢ়তা আর ইচ্ছাশক্তিকে কোনো কিছুর কাছে হার মানাতে দেননি বলেই কিন্ত আপনি আজ আপনার এই পজিশনে। বাস্তবিক এমন কী আছে যে আপনি অর্জন করতে পারবেন না? সবই আপনার হাতের মুঠোয়, শুধু দরকার মনের মাঝে একটা জেদ, একটা কম্পিটিশন। আর সেই অনুযায়ী নিজেকে তৈরি করা। আমার দেখা কিছু ব্যক্তি যারা জাতীয় বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় (জগন্নাত কলেজ, ঢাকা সিটি কলেজ) থেকে পাস করেছেন এবং কিছু শিক্ষার্থী যাদের সিজিপিএ ২.৭০, তারা আজ বিদেশের কোনো ভার্সিটির শিক্ষকতা করছেন, কেউ মাস্টার্স আবার কেউ পিএইচডি করছেন। আরেক ছোট ভাই সেই ২০১১ থেকে চেষ্টা করে আসছেন জিআরই দিয়ে ইএসএ যাবেই। অবশেষে ২০১৮ সালে সে তার সাফল্য অর্জন করতে পেরেছেন। তাহলে আপনার যোগ্যতার কী অভাব? না, অভাব শুধু ইচ্ছা শক্তির, অভাব উচ্চশিক্ষা ও স্কলারশিপ ও উচ্চশিক্ষার আবেদনের পদ্ধতি সম্পর্কে ভালো করে জানতে না পারা। আমি মনে করি যাদের সিজিপিএ ৩.০ বা ততোধিক তাদের অবশ্যই উচ্চশিক্ষার জন্য চেষ্টা করা উচিত। আসলে পাস করার পর আমি নিজেও জানতাম না উচ্চশিক্ষায় কীভাবে কী করে অ্যাপ্লাই করতে হয়। কীভাবে একটা স্কলারশিপের জন্য আবেদন করতে হয়। আমার সাথে চাকরিতে জয়েন করা ব্যক্তিটি যখন উচ্চশিক্ষার জন্য বিদেশে চলে যায় তখন আমি বুঝতে পারি আমিও যেতে পারি। বর্তমানে আমাদের অনেক শিক্ষার্থী বিদেশে পড়াশোনা করছেন। আপনি ইচ্ছা করলেই কিন্ত তাদের সঙ্গে কথা বলে নিজেকে প্রস্তুত করতে পারেন। আর এখন ভার্সিটিতে/অনলাইনে উচ্চ শিক্ষার জন্য হেল্প গাইড আছে। এইগুলো ফলো করলেই আপনি অনেক কিছু জানতে ও শিখতে পারবেন। নিজেকে তৈরি করা : উচ্চশিক্ষার স্বপ্নটা আমি মনে করি ভার্সিটিতে ভর্তি হবার পর থেকে দেখা উচিত। এতে করে যেমন ভালোভাবে অ্যাকাডেমিক পড়াশোনার প্রতি আগ্রহ বাড়বে তেমনি উচ্চশিক্ষার প্রসেসগুলোও জানা হবে। যেমন রেজাল্টের পাশাপাশি দরকার হয় ভালো ইংলিশ চর্চা (আইইএলটিএস, জিআরই, টোফেল ইত্যাদি)। সাধারণত আমাদের ছেলেমেয়েরা ৩য়/৪র্থ বর্ষে উঠে উচ্চশিক্ষার জন্য আগ্রহ দেখায় ও সেই অনুপাতে কাজ করে। ভার্সিটি লাইফের শুরু থেকে ইংলিশের এই চর্চাসমূহ করতে থাকলে দেখা যাবে তুমি ৪র্থ বর্ষের সময়ই আইইএলটিএস/ জিআরই টেস্ট দিয়ে ভালো একটা স্কোর করতে পারবে। আর পাস করার পর অনেকের ওপরে ফ্যামিলির একটা রেসপনসিবিলিটি চলে আসে। তখন অনেকে উচ্চশিক্ষার আশা বাদ দিয়ে সাধারণত চাকরির সন্ধানে লেগে যান। তাই ইচ্ছে হলেও তখন এই টেস্ট দিতে পারেন না। তাই আমি বলব যারা উচ্চশিক্ষায় যেতে চান, পড়াশোনার পাশাপাশি আইএলটিএস/ জিআরই এর চর্চা করতে পারেন। এইটা আপনার ভার্সিটির পড়াশোনার কোনো অবনতি ঘটাবে না। যাই হোক আজ আমি লিখব কীভাবে জাপানে উচ্চশিক্ষার জন্য আবেদন ও নিজেকে প্রস্তত করবেন। জাপানে স্কলারশিপ : জাপানে মূলত নিম্নোক্ত স্কলারশিপে আসা যায় ১. মেক্সট স্কলারশিপ : মেক্সট স্কলারশিপের জন্য দুইভাবে আবেদন করা যায়। ক) জাপান অ্যাম্বাসি বাংলাদেশের মাধ্যমে : আবেদনের সময় প্রতি বছরের মে মাসে জাতীয় পত্রিকায় আবেদন ডাকা হয়। সীমিত সংখ্যক স্কলারশিপ। খ) জাপানিজ ভার্সিটির মাধ্যমে : আবেদনের সময় ১ নভেম্বরের থেকে ফেব্রুয়ারি পর্যন্ত। ভার্সিটি রিকমেন্ডেশনের মাধ্যমে সুযোগ ও স্কলারশিপের সংখ্যাও অনেক বেশি। ২০১৮ সালে ২৬৭ জন বাংলাদেশি মেক্সট স্কলারশিপ পায়। ২. এডিবি স্কলারশিপ : এইখানে জিপিএ এর চাইতে বেশি দরকার ২ বছর অভিজ্ঞতা। যাদের পাশ করার পর দুইবছর জব এক্সপেরিয়েন্স নেই তারা অ্যাপ্লাই করতে পারবেন না। আর আপ্লিকেশনের তারিখ ভার্সিটির ওপর নির্ভর করে। ৩. ওয়ার্ল্ড ব্যাংক স্কলারশিপ : আপ্লিকেশনের সময় সাধারণত প্রতি বছরের মার্চ মাসে। ভার্সিটি সিলেকশন : জাপানের সব ভার্সিটিতেই পড়াশোনার সিস্টেম একই। তবে স্কলারশিপের জন্য পাবলিক ভার্সিটি ও ন্যাশনাল ভার্সিটি সিলেক্ট করাই উত্তম। কারণ এইসব ভার্সিটিতে স্কলারশিপের সংখ্যা সাধারণত বেশি থাকে। তাই গুগলে লিস্ট অব পাবলিক ইউভার্সিটি/ ন্যাশনাল ইউনিভার্সিটি ইন জাপান লিখে সার্চ দিলেই সব ভার্সিটি পাওয়া যাবে। সব ভার্সিটির ওয়েব পেইজ জাপান, কোরিয়ান, চাইনিজ ও ইংরেজিতে লেখা। ইমেইল : আমি শুধু ল্যাবের প্রধানকেই ইমেইল করতে বলব। যদি প্রফেসর না থাকে তাহলে অ্যাসোসিয়েট প্রফেসরকে ইমেইল করেন। মেক্সট স্কলারশিপের জন্য আবেদন শুরু ২-৩ মাস পূর্বে থেকেই প্রফেসরদের ইমেইল করা ভালো। কারণ জাপানিজ কোনো প্রফেসর যদি একজনকে অ্যাপ্লাই করতে বলে তাহলে অন্য কাউকে আর এই সুযোগ দেবে না। মানে অন্য কেউ ইমেইল দিলে রিপ্লাইয়ে বলে দেবে সে একজনকে অ্যাপ্লাই করতে বলেছে। তাই আমি বলব ই-মেইলের মাধ্যমে কমপক্ষে পাঁচ জন প্রফেসরকে ম্যানেজ করে পাঁচটি ভার্সিটিতে অ্যাপ্লাই করতে। তবে, আপনি ৩টা ভার্সিটি থেকে সিলেক্ট হলেও ফাইনাল আপ্লিকেশন (বরাবর জাপান মিনিস্ট্রি) একটাই করতে পারবে। মানে বাকি দুইটা আপনাকে বাদ দিতে হবে। ই-মেইলে আপনার অ্যাকাডেমিক ট্রান্সক্রিপ্ট ও কারিকুলাম ভিটা (সিভি) অবশ্যই যুক্ত করবেন। আর ই-মেইলে সেল্প ইনট্রুডাকশন, অ্যাকাডেমিক ডিগ্রি, ডিগ্রি রেজাল্ট, রিসার্চ ইন্টারেস্ট অ্যান্ড হোয়াই ইউ ইন্টারেস্ট টু হিম (প্রফেসর) সম্পর্কে ২০০-২২০ শব্দের মধ্যে লিখলেই ভালো। আবেদনের খরচ : জাপানে কোনো ভার্সিটিতে অ্যাপ্লাই করতে কোনো অ্যাপ্লিকেশন ফি লাগে না। তাই আমি বলব কমপক্ষে ৫টি ভার্সিটিতে অ্যাপ্লাই করতে। আবেদনের সময় প্রয়োজনীয় ডকুমেন্ট : ১. আবেদনপত্র : জাপানের সব ইউনিভার্সিটিতে মেক্সটের আবেদনদের ফর্ম সাধারণত একটাই। যেটা জাপান সরকারের প্রদত্ত ফর্মেট হতে পারে। তাই একই অ্যাপ্লিকেশনে দিয়ে সব জায়গায় আপ্লাই করা যায়। তবে গুটিকয়েক ইউনিভার্সিটিতে অনলাইন অ্যাপ্লিকেশন সিস্টেম আছে। যেমন টোকিও ইউনিভার্সিটি। বেশিরভাগ ক্ষেত্রে প্রফেসর নিজেই বলে দেবে আপনাকে কী করতে হবে, আর কীভাবে অ্যাপ্লাই করতে হবে আর কী কী ডকুমেন্ট কীভাবে প্রস্তুত করতে হবে। ২. রিকমেন্ডেশন লেটার : স্কলারশিপ পাওয়ার জন্য রিকমেন্ডেশন একটা গুরুত্বপূর্ণ অংশ। সব ইউনিভার্সিটির ওয়েবসাইটেই এই ফরম আপলোড করা থাকে। এই ফরমের সঙ্গে ইচ্ছে করলে নিজের লেখা পেপারও যুক্ত করতে পারবে। তবে কার কাছ থেকে রিকমেন্ডেশন নিতে হবে সেইটা অনেক গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। অনেক ইউনিভার্সিটির রিকমেন্ডেশন লেটারে বলা হয়ে থাকে, ডিন বা প্রফেসর সমপর্যায়ের ব্যক্তি হতে হবে এবং রিকমেন্ডেশন লেটার লিখতে হয় ‘বরাবর প্রেসিডেন্ট (জাপানিজ বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের নাম)। তবে কিছু কিছু ভার্সিটির ক্ষেত্রে ভিন্ন। তাই আমি বলব ডিন বা প্রফেসর হতে সব সময় রিকমেন্ডেশন লেটার সংগ্রহ করতে। এছাড়া, আপনার রেস্পেক্টিভ সুপারভাইজার ও আপনার জন্য অ্যাডমিশন কমিটির কাছে আপনার জন্য রিকমেন্ডেশন লেটার লিখবে। এই দুই রিকমেন্ডেশন লেটার আপ্লিকেন্ট সিলেকশনের জন্য খুব বড় ফ্যাক্টর। ৩. রিসার্চ প্রপোজাল : জাপানের সব ইউনিভার্সিটির রিসার্চ প্রপোজালের ফর্ম একটাই। সর্বোচ্চ দুই পেইজ। এইটা লিখার জন্য খুব ক্রিটিক্যাল হবার কিছুই নেই। তবে যে বিষয়ে আপনার পড়ার ইচ্ছে ওইটা ভালোভাবে গুছিয়ে লিখতে হবে। কিছু প্রশ্নের উত্তরের মাধ্যমেই আপনি সেইটা গুছিয়ে লিখতে পারেন। যেমন: ক. যে টপিকের ওপর পড়াশোনা করতে ইচ্ছুক সেইটা পরিষ্কার? তাহলে টপিকের একটা টাইটেল নির্ধারণ করেন। খ. এইবার এই টপিকের সম্পর্কে আপনি যা জানেন তা লিখেন যাকে আমরা ইন্ট্রুডাকশন বলি। প্রয়োজন হলে গুগলের হেল্প নেন। গ. এইবার সেই টপিকের ওপর কিছু কাজ খুঁজে বের করেন (গুগল থেকে)। ২-৩ টা পেপার ডাউন-লোড করে একটু পড়তে হবে শুধু টপিক আর কোন মেথড অ্যাপ্লাই করেছেন আর কী ফল পেয়েছে তা একটু বুঝার জন্য। খুব ডিটেল পড়ার প্রয়োজন নেই। পরিশেষে তিনটা পেপারের ওপর একটা সারসংক্ষেপ তৈরি করি (যাকে আমরা ব্যাকগ্রাউন্ড বা লিটারেচার রিভিউ বলি) ঘ. এইবার লিখেন, আপনি কেন এই টপিকটা পছন্দ করেছেন, তার ওপর কয়েকটা লাইন। ( আবজেক্ট ও সিকনিফিকেন্ট) ঙ. কাজটি আপনি কীভাবে করবেন? নিউমেরিক্যাল না এক্সপেরিমেন্টাল স্টাডি সেই সম্পর্কে ৩-৪ লাইন লিখতে হবে। যদি কোনো ওয়ার্কিং ডায়াগ্রাম থাকে তাহলে যুক্ত করতে পারেন। চ. এই কাজ শেষে আপনি কী আউটপুট (সম্ভাব্য) পাবেন? সেই বিষয়ের কিছু লাইন লিখেন। ছ. পরিশেষে একটা উপসংহার তবে প্রপোজাল লিখার জন্যে প্রফেসরকে তার পেপারের জন্য বলতে পারেন। প্রফেসর আপনাকে ই-মেইলে বা ডিএইচএল এ পাঠিয়ে দেবে। আমি নিজেও ২ বার ডিএইচএল এর মাধ্যমে অনেক পেপার পেয়েছি। ৪. ইংরেজির দক্ষতা : জাপানের ভার্সিটিগুলোতে সাধারণত ইংরেজির দক্ষতার জন্য কোনো আইইএলটিএস লাগে না। তবে কিছু ভার্সিটিতে উল্লেখ থাকলেও তার গুরুত্ব খুবই কম। মিডিয়াম অব ইনস্ট্রাকশন ইন ইংলিশ দিয়েই এপ্লাই করতে পারবেন। ৫. পাবলিকেশন : পৃথিবীর সব ভার্সিটিতেই এপ্লিকেশন যাচাইয়ের সময় এইটা প্রধান্য দেওয়া হয়। আমি মনে করি, অ্যাপ্লাই করার পূর্বে কমপক্ষে একটা কনফারেন্স পেপার হলেও থাকা ভালো। সেইটা যেখানেই পাবলিশ হোক না কেন। কারণ এইটা দিয়ে যাচাই হয় আবেদনকারীর রিসার্চ ও পেপার লিখার সক্ষমতা আছে কী নেই। সব পাবলিকেশনের প্রথম পেইজ ( অ্যাবস্ট্রাক্ট পেজ) আপ্লিকেশন ডকুমেন্টের সঙ্গে যুক্ত করেন। ৬. অ্যাকাডেমিক ডকুমেন্ট : ইউনিভার্সিটির মাধ্যমে সত্যায়িত আন্ডার গ্রাজুয়েট সার্টিফিকেট, ট্রান্সক্রিপ্ট অ্যান্ড মিডিয়াম অব ইনস্ট্রাকশন ইন ইংলিশ, ডিগ্রি কমপ্লেশন সার্টিফিকেট (কিছু ভার্সিটিতে প্রয়োজন) ৭. পাসপোর্টের কপি : পাসপোর্ট না থাকলে ন্যামনাল আইডি দিয়েও করতে পারবেন। তবে ভার্সিটির মাধ্যমে সিলেকশনের সঙ্গে সঙ্গে পাসপোর্টের কপি দিতে হবে। ৮. রেজাল্ট : শুধু জাপানে নয়, যে কোনো দেশেই সরকারি বা প্রাইভেট স্কলারশিপ অনেক প্রতিযোগিতামূলক। কারণ এইখানে সিলেকশন হয় একটি কমিটির মাধ্যমে যারা সকল অ্যাপ্লিকেন্টের সব ক্রাইটেরিয়ার ওপর স্কোরিং করে। তাই যাদের সিজিপিএ ৩.৩০ বা অধিক তাদের বলব মেক্সট এডিবি ও ডব্লিউবি অ্যাপ্লাই করতে। ৯. নিজ খরচে পড়াশোনা করা যাবে? জাপানে ইন্টারন্যাশনাল ছাত্রছাত্রীদের মাঝে ৫০% এর বেশিই হবে চাইনিজ। এদের বেশিরভাগই জাপানে পড়তে আসেন নিজ খরচে। জাপানে টিউশন ফি ৬৫০০-৮০০০ ইউএসডি। যদি প্রফেসর টিউশন ফি ওয়েব করতে পারে সে ক্ষেত্রে জাপানে পড়াশোনা করতে আসলে কোনো সমস্যা হবে বলে আমি মনে করি না। কারণ পড়াশোনার পাশাপাশি মাসে ১২৮ ঘণ্টা কাজ করার অনুমতি থাকে যার মাধ্যমে ১২৮০০০ জাপানিজ ইয়েন ইনকাম করতে পারবে। টোকিওতে ভালোভাবে তা দিয়ে চলতে পারবে আর অন্য কোথাও হলে মাসে ৭০-৮০ হাজার ইয়েনে চলতে পারবে। তবে বাইরে জব করতে চাইলে জাপানিজ ভাষা বলা অবশ্যই জানতে হবে। তবে কারো যদি ভবিষ্যতে জাপানে চাকরি ও জব করার ইচ্ছা থাকে তাহলে আমি বলব জাপানিজ ভাষার প্রাইমারি লেভেল এন৫ ও এন৪ শেষ করে আসতে। ইন্টারন্যাশনালদের জন্যে কাজের অনেক সুযোগ রয়েছে বিশেষ করে যানা জাপানিজ বলতে পারে। এছাড়া জাপানে অনেক প্রাইভেট স্কলারশিপ আছে যা শুধু ভর্তি হওয়া ইন্টারন্যাশনাল শিক্ষার্থীদের জন্য। ১০. ভাইবা : আবেদন করার পর প্রফেসর স্কাইপির মাধ্যমে ভাইবার জন্য আপনাকে বলবে। তবে ভাইবা খুবই সিম্পল। ভাইবাটাকে আমি বলব শুধু একটা পরিচিতি পর্ব। শুরুতেই আপনার সম্পর্কে কিছু জিজ্ঞাসা করবেন। তারপর আপনি কেন জাপানে পড়তে ইচ্ছুক সেই সম্পর্কে কিছু কথা বলবেন। এরপর আপনার প্রপোজাল সম্পর্কে কিছু জিজ্ঞাসা করবেন। আর প্রফেসর যেই বিষয় নিয়ে কাজ করে আর সম্পর্কে কিছু জেনে রাখা ভালো। শুধু বেসিক কথাবার্তা। তবে এতে নার্ভাসের কিছুই নেই। সব মিলিয়ে মাস্টার্সের জন্য ১৫-২০ মিনিট আর পিএইচডি জন্য ২০-৪০ মিনিট কথাবার্তা হবে। আরেকটি কথা মাস্টার্স না করে পিএইচডিতে যাওয়া সম্ভব না। তাই মাস্টার্স ডিগ্রি থাকলে পিএইচডি এর জন্য অ্যাপ্লাই করতে পারবেন। Collected",

(Statement of Purpose)নামের একটি রচনা। ২. রেকমেন্ডেশন লেটার ৩. টোফেল স্কোর ৪. GRE/GMATE স্কোর স্টেটমেন্ট_অফ_পারপাস: মার্কিন বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলো মাস্টার্স বা পিএইচডি স্কলারশিপ এর জন্য আবেদন করতে হলে (Statement of Purpose)বা সংক্ষেপে SOP নামের একটি ছোট রচনা সংযুক্ত করতে হয়। এটি হচ্ছে ১.৫ থেকে ২ পৃষ্ঠার একটি রচনা যার মধ্যে আপনি নিজেকে, নিজের উদ্দেশ্য-লক্ষ্যকে তুলে ধরবেন। আপনার কোন বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের কোন বিষয়ে আগ্রহ, কেন আগ্রহ তা নিয়ে সংক্ষেপে বর্ণনা করবেন। তবে আমাদের বাংলাদেশের স্টুডেন্টদের সবচেয়ে বড় সমস্যা হলো আমরা অপটুতার দরুন Myself টাইপের রচনা লিখে দেই। অনভিজ্ঞ হাতের লেখা SOP স্টুডেন্টকে খুব একটা বেশি দূর নিয়ে যেতে পারে না। আমাদের স্টুডেন্টদের আরো একটা বাজে টেন্ডেন্সি হল- কোন বড় ভাইয়ের SOP কপি করে তুলে দেয়া। আপনি কয়েকটি SOP দেখে ধারণা নিতে পারেন। কিন্তু কখনোই কপি করবেন না। যারা ভর্তি প্রক্রিয়ার সাথে যুক্ত আছে তারা খুব সহজেই এগুলো ধরতে পারে। ফলে এই ধরনের SOP গুলোর জায়গা হয় আস্তাকুড়ে। SOP লেখার সময়ে এই দিকগুলো লক্ষ্য রাখবেন- ১. SOP লেখার আগে ভালো প্রস্তুতি নিন। কখনোই তাড়াহুড়ো করে SOP লিখবেন না। কমপক্ষে ১মাস হাতে সময় নিন। ২. আপনার SOPতে এই পাঁচ টি বেসিক ইনফরমেশন গুলো থাকতেই হবে- (১) (Introduction) আপনার নিজের সম্পর্কে বলুন। আপনার আগ্রহ, উদ্দেশ্য নিয়ে বলুন। কোন বিষয়ে আপনি পড়তে চান বা গবেষণা করতে চান এবং এর জন্য যৌক্তিক কারণ প্রদর্শন করুন। (২) আপনার শিক্ষাগত যোগ্যতা সম্পর্কে লিখুন। শিক্ষা জীবনের কোন দিকটি আপনাকে এই বিষয়ের প্রতি অনুপ্রেরণা দিয়েছে বলুন। (৩)আপনার কাঙ্খিত গবেষণা ও এটি নির্বাচনের কারণ স্পষ্ট করে বলুন। (৪)কেন আপনি এই বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে পড়তে চান বা গবেষণা করতে চান বলুন। এই বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের কোন দিক আপনাকে আকর্ষণ করে তা ফোকাস করুন। (৫) আপনার উদ্দেশ্য,লক্ষ্য ও আকাঙ্ক্ষার প্রতি আলোকপাত করে নিজেকে এই স্কলারশিপের জন্য একজন। সুযোগ্য প্রতিনিধি হিসেবে প্রতিষ্ঠিত করে চমৎকারভাবে ফিনিশিং করুন। ৩.

SOPতে যেন কোন Grammatical ভুল বা বানান ভুল যেন না হয় সেদিকে লক্ষ্য রাখবেন। কারণ এগুলো চোখে পড়ে বেশি। ৬.

UDI এর ওয়েবসাইট (https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/?c=bgd) থেকে ভিসা আবেদন ফর্ম, চেকলিস্ট এর ফর্ম ((https://www.udi.no/en/checklists-container/studies-au-pair/checklist-student/?c=bgd) পূরণ করে প্রিন্ট করে সাইন দিবেন। ৭. পাসপোর্টের প্রথম থেকে শেষ পাতা পর্যন্ত (ব্যবহার হোক আর না হোক) সাদাকালো ফটোকপি করে নিবেন। ৮. পুলিশ ক্লিয়ারেন্স নেওয়ার কোনো দরকার নাই, বার্থ সার্টিফিকেটেরও কোনো দরকার নাই। অযথা এগুলো জোগাড় করতে গিয়ে নিজের সময় আর অর্থের অপচয় করবেন না। ৯. অফার লেটারের সাথে লেটার অফ ভিসা পারপাস-এ লেখা থাকবে যে আপনার উনিভার্সিটি হাউজিং গেরেন্টেড, তাই বলে নাকে তেল দিয়ে না-ঘুমিয়ে সঠিক সময়ে হাউসিং এর জন্য আবেদন না-করলে কিন্তু হাউজিং পেতে দেরি হবে। আমার মতে অফার লেটার পাওয়ার পরই হাউসিং এর জন্য আবেদন করে ফেলা উচিত। হাউজিং পেলে আপনাকে ওরা ৫০০০ ক্রোনা ডিপোজিট করতে বলবে কিন্তু আপনি আবার ফিরতি ইমেইলে বলে দিবেন নতুন করে আর কোনো টাকা দিতে পারবো না , আগে যে ১১১৬৫৭ ক্রোনা দিছি ঐখান থেকে কেটে নাও। ১০. সব কাগজ রেডি করে গুলশান ২-এ VFS এর অফিসে গিয়ে জমা দিয়ে নাকে তেল দিয়ে ঘুম দিবেন। আগে কোনো ভিসা ইন্টারভিউ ছিল না নরওয়ের স্টুডেন্ট ভিসার জন্য। তবে এই বছর থেকে ইন্টারভিউ প্রথা চালু হয়েছে। ১১. ভিসা অ্যাপ্রুভ হয়ে গেলে ওরা আপনাকে ইমেল করে জানাবে। আমার ভিসা হতে ১৮ দিন লেগেছিল, আরো কম বেশি লাগতে পারে। ১২. তারপর আপনার পাসপোর্ট নিয়ে ডেনমার্ক অ্যাম্বাসিতে জমা দিবেন। ভিসার সিল লাগাবে তাই (নরওয়ে এর অ্যাম্বাসি আমাদের দেশে থাকলেও নরওয়েজিয়ান ভিসা দেওয়ার কাজটা ডেনমার্ক অ্যাম্বাসি করে থাকে)। ১৩. অতঃপর ভিসা সমেত পাসপোর্ট হাতে পেয়ে একটা সেলফি তুলে ফেবুতে পোস্ট করবেন নরওয়ে হেয়ার এই কাম। লেখা ও কৃতজ্ঞতা- দিদারুল আলম আকন ভাই * বর্তমানে সার্টিফিকেট সত্যায়িত করতে হয় না।",

৩। মোটিভেশন লেটার লেখার ক্ষেত্রে প্রয়োজনীয় সময় দিন। একজন শিক্ষার্থীকে তার নিজস্ব একাডেমিক ব্যাকগ্রাউন্ড, প্রফেশনাল অভিজ্ঞতা, কেন তিনি এই প্রোগ্রামে আবেদন করেছেন সংক্ষিপ্ত কথায় তার আবেদনের তাৎপর্যপূর্ণ কারণ, এই প্রোগ্রামের মধ্য দিয়ে দেশ কিংবা সমাজে কিভাবে উপকৃত হবে, নিজের ভবিষ্যৎ পরিকল্পনা প্রভৃতি নিখুঁতভাবে সুন্দর উপস্থাপনার মধ্য দিয়ে ১-২ পাতার মধ্যে লিখে জমা দিতে হয়। এক্ষেত্রে প্রয়োজনে ইন্টারনেট থেকে কিংবা ইতোপূর্বে উচ্চ শিক্ষায় দেশের বাহিরে পাড়ি দিয়েছেন এমন মানুষদের কাছ থেকে যথাযথ সহযোগিতা নিন। মনে রাখবেন- আপনার মোটিভেশন লেটার স্কলারশিপ প্রাপ্তিতে আপনার যোগ্যতাকে অনেকাংশেই বহুগুণ বাড়িয়ে দেবে! ৪। ইরাসমুস স্কলারশিপের আবেদনে অধিকাংশ প্রোগ্রামের ক্ষেত্রেই জীবন বৃত্তান্ত (Curriculum Vitae) জমা দিতে হয়। ইউরোপের ক্ষেত্রে জীবন বৃত্তান্ত তৈরিতে Europass ফরম্যাট ব্যবহার করা উত্তম। ৫। প্রত্যেক প্রোগ্রামেই রিকমেন্ডেশন লেটার জমাদানের বাধ্যবাধকতা থাকে। শিক্ষার্থীকে দীর্ঘ সময় ধরে ভালভাবে চিনেন এমন ২ জন যোগ্য ব্যক্তি থেকেই রিকমেন্ডেশন লেটার নেওয়া উত্তম। তবে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় শিক্ষক, স্নাতক/স্নাতকোত্তর গবেষণা কাজের সুপারভাইজার, কিংবা আপনার কর্মক্ষেত্র যদি আবেদনের সাথে সম্পর্কিত হয় তবে সেই প্রতিষ্ঠান দায়িত্বপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তির কাছে থেকেই রিকমেন্ডেশন লেটার নেওয়া ভাল। ৬। সময়কে অনুধাবন করুন। কখনোই ডেডলাইনের তারিখে এপ্লিকেশন করার জন্য বসে থাকা ঠিক নয়। সামান্য কারণে অনেক সময় শেষ মুহূর্তে এসে অনেক কিছুই হারাতে হতে পারে কিংবা ভুল হয়ে যেতে পারে! তাছাড়া ইন্টারনেট সম্পর্কিত ঝামেলাতো থাকছেই। ★শেষকথা: শুধুমাত্র সময়োপযোগী সিদ্ধান্ত ও সেই সিদ্ধান্ত বাস্তবায়নের যথাযথ প্রচেষ্টার মধ্যদিয়ে ইউরোপে উচ্চশিক্ষায় ইরাসমুস মুন্ডুস স্কলারশিপই হতে পারে আপনার পরবর্তী গন্তব্য! আপনি যদি সত্যিকারের উচ্চশিক্ষায় শিক্ষিত, গবেষক, ভ্রমণবিলাসী কিংবা পৃথিবী দেখার স্বপ্ন লালনকারীদের একজন হয়ে থাকেন, তাহলে আর দেরি কেন? অন্তত একবার ঘুরে আসুন ইরাসমুস মুন্ডুস স্কলারশিপের ওয়েবসাইটে https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-plus/…/emjmd-catalogue_en নিজের অজান্তেই দেখবেন, আপনিই এই স্কলারশিপ পাওয়ার উপযুক্ত। একটু সাহস আর একটি সিদ্ধান্ত, আপনাকে করবে আপনার স্বপ্নের সমান বড়। অন্যের সফলতার গল্প পড়ে পড়ে আর কত? আগামীর এই দিনে আপনার সফলতার গল্প পড়বে অন্যরা…, এই স্বপ্নটুকু বাস্তবায়নের লক্ষ্যে একাগ্রচিত্তে কাজ শুরু করে দিন, দেখা হবে বিজয়ে। লেখক: মো. আশিকুর রহমান কান্ট্রি এম্বাসেডর অব বাংলাদেশ, ইরাসমুস মুন্ডুস এসোসিয়েশন (EMA) ভাইস-প্রেসিডেন্ট ,EMA সাউথ এশিয়ান চ্যাপ্টার PhD রিসার্চ ফেলো, ইউনিভার্সিটি অব টুরিন, ইতালি।",

GPA + GRE + TOEFL + SOP + LOR + Resume আমরা প্যাকেজটাকে দুইভাগে ভাগ করি। নেগেটিভ সাইড: সিজিপিএ প্রসপ্যাক্টিভ পজিটিভ সাইড: জিআরই, টোয়েফল, এলওআর, রেজ্যুম,এসওপি সো, ছয়টা প্যারামিটারের মধ্যে একটাতে আপনি ইতোমধ্যে খারাপ করে ফেলেছেন। কিন্তু বাকি আছে পাঁচটা। কংগ্র্যচুলেশন্স। এখনও অনেক কিছু করার আছে আপনার। আপনার লো সিজিপিএ আছে ভালো কথা। এর মধ্যেও আপনার সিজিপিএ কার্ভ যদি ইউ শেপের হয়, তাহলে তো সোনায় সোহাগা। ইউ শেপের কার্ভ প্রমাণ করবে আপনি প্রথম দিকে কোনও একটা কারণে রেজাল্ট খারাপ করেছেন কিন্তু পরে ভুল বুঝতে পেরে নিজেকে সামলে নিয়েছেন। সারভাইভাল তাই না? গ্র্যাজুয়েট স্কুল সারভাইভ করার জায়গা। আজ মুখ থুবড়ে পরবেন, কাল উঠে দাঁড়াবেন। সো, এটাকেই তো আপনি প্রমাণ করে দিচ্ছেন তাই নয় কি? ও হ্যাঁ, ভার্সিটিগুলো শেষ দুবছরের সিজিপিএ নিয়ে মাথা ঘামায় কেন? কারণ মোটামুটি সব সাবজেক্টেই শেষ দুবছরে সেই সাবজেক্টের কোর বা মেইন কোর্সগুলো শেখানো হয়। এলিমেনটারি স্ট্যাটিস্টিকসে আপনি কী করছেন তার চেয়ে বড় কথা থার্ড বা ফোর্থ ইয়ারে ইকনোমেট্রিক্সে কী করেছেন। তাহলে কীভাবে লো সিজিপিএ-কে সামলাবেন? • জিআরই/ টোয়েফলে গুরুত্ব দিন। • অনার্সে খারাপ থাকলে মাস্টার্সে নিজের সবটুকু উজাড় করে রেজাল্ট ভালো করতে চেষ্টা করুন। • একাডেমিক পড়াশোনার বাইরে অন্য কোনো স্কিল অর্জন করুন। (যেমন: প্রোগ্রামিং) • এক্সট্রা কারিকুলার থাকলে সেটা উল্লেখ করুন। • নিজের প্রোফাইলের সাথে মানানসই ভার্সিটি সিলেক্ট করুন। • পাবলিকেশন করতে চেষ্টা করুন। যদিও এটা কম্পালসরি না, তবুও পাবলিকেশন মানেই বিশেষ কিছু। আবার পাবলিকেশনের নামে জাঙ্ক উৎপাদন করাও ঠিক নয়। • কোনো ভার্সিটিতেই মেইল করতে ছাড়বেন না। যেসব ভার্সিটির রিকুয়ারমেন্ট ৩.০০ কিন্তু আপনার সিজিপিএ তিনের কম সেখানেও মেইল করুন। মেইল করতে ইন্টারনেট বিল ছাড়া আর খরচ নেই । আগামীকাল কী নিয়ে আপনার জীবনে আসবে তা কেউ জানে না। এমনও হতে পারে সেখানকার কোনো প্রফেসর আপনার প্রোফাইল পছন্দ করে ফেলবেন! • টিচারের পিছনে ঘুরে ‘আপনি নিষ্পাপ’- এরকম লেখা কয়েকটা এলওআর বাগিয়ে নিন। এলওআর-এ টিচার আপনাকে যত মাই ডিয়ারভাবে বলবেন ততই লাভ। আপনি তাকে চিনি এবং আমি তাকে খুবই ভালোভাবে চিনি- এ দুইয়ের মধ্যে অনেক তফাৎ। • জীবনে ঘটা যেসব ঘটনা আপনার রেজাল্টকে প্রভাবিত করেছিল তা খুবই সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে এসওপিতে উল্লেখ করতে পারেন। আপনি কীভাবে ঘুরে দাঁড়িয়েছেন সেটাও উল্লেখ করুন। মশার কামড়ে ডেঙ্গু হয়ে আপনার রেজাল্ট যদি খারাপ হয় তার মানে আপনি নিশ্চয়ই খারাপ স্টুডেন্ট নন। এ ধরনের ঘটনা যে কারো জীবনে ঘটতে পারে সেটা অ্যাডমিশন কমিটি জানেন। * যদি অনার্সে ভুল সাবজেক্ট নেওয়ার জন্য রেজাল্ট খারাপ করেন কিন্তু এখন পছন্দের সাবজেক্টে যেতে চান, তাহলে সেই সাবজেক্টের সাথে রিলেভেন্ট কিছু করার চেষ্টা করুন। পড়েছেন ইতিহাস কিন্তু পড়তে চান জিওগ্রাফি? একটা জিআইএস কোর্স করে ফেলুন। • নিজের প্রতি কমিটেড থাকুন। ভার্সিটির ফার্স্ট ইয়ারে হায়ার স্টাডির স্বপ্ন দেখে এটাকে টেনে শেষ পর্যন্ত নিয়ে যাওয়া খুব কঠিন। আর সিজিপিএ যদি কম হয় তাহলে কনফিডেন্স হারিয়ে ফেলাটাই স্বাভাবিক। ★দ্বিতীয় পর্ব: কীভাবে কম্পেন্সেট করবেন আপনার লো সিজিপিএ! মূল কথাগুলো আগেই বলা হয়েছে। এই পোস্টে আরও কিছু উপায়ের সাথে ইউএসএর ভার্সিটিতে একসেপ্টেড হয়েছেন এমন কয়েকজনের প্রোফাইল, লো সিজিপিএ একসেপ্ট করে এমন কয়েকটা ভার্সিটির নাম আলোচনা করা হবে। লো সিজিপিএ থাকলে প্রথমেই যেটা করার থাকে তা হল জিআরইতে ভালো করা। এর কোনো বিকল্প নেই। অনেকে বেশি বুঝতে গিয়ে যেসব রিসোর্স পপুলার না সেগুলো নিয়ে বেশি ব্যস্ত থাকে। ফলাফলটাও হাতেনাতে পায়। জিআরইতে ভালো করতে ইটিএস, ম্যাগুশ, ম্যানহ্যাটন, নোভা, কাপলান, প্রিন্সটন, ব্যারন্স এগুলো ছাড়া আর তেমন কিছু লাগে না। আমার একজন টিচার শুধু ম্যানহ্যাটন ১-৬, ৭-৮, ৫ এলবি পড়েই স্কোর তুলেছেন ৩২৯! এডব্লিউএতে পেয়েছেন ৪। দুঃখ করে বলছিলেন তার টাইপিং স্পিড ভালো না তাই এই সেকশনে এত খারাপ হয়েছে! এছাড়া অনেকে আছে ইটিএস এর রিসোর্সগুলো পড়তে প্রচণ্ড অনীহা। যারা আপনার টেস্ট নেবে তাদের রিসোর্সগুলো ফলো না করা মানেই নিজের পায়ে কুড়াল মারা। বাজারের কোনও বইয়ের স্ট্যান্ডার্ড ইটিএস এর এত কাছাকাছি না। ইন্টারনেটে যত মক টেস্ট আছে সবগুলো দিয়ে দেওয়া উচিৎ। অবশ্যই সবচেয়ে স্ট্যান্ডার্ড মক টেস্ট পাওয়ার প্রেপ ২। আর অর্থ সংকটে না থাকলে একটা ম্যাগুশ সাবস্ক্রিপশন কিনে নিতে পারেন। সম্ভব হলে কিছুদিন কষ্ট করে একটা পাবলিকেশন করুন। লো সিজিপিএ দেখলেই মনে হবে সেই সাবজেক্টে আপনার ভালো দখল নেই। কিন্তু একটা পাবলিকেশন করতে সেই সাবজেক্টের উপর প্রচুর পড়াশোনা এবং স্কিল থাকতে হয়। তাই একটা পাবলিকেশন লো সিজিপিএকে অনেকখানি মেকআপ করবে। যদিও পাবলিকেশন কোনো ম্যান্ডেটরি রিকুয়ারমেনট না। যদি সাবজেক্ট রিলেটেড শর্ট কোর্স বা ইন্টার্নশিপ করার সুযোগ থাকে তাহলে সেটা হাতছাড়া করবেন না। ভার্সিটি সিলেক্ট করার ব্যাপারে রিয়েলিস্টিক হওয়া উচিৎ। লোয়ার র ্যাঙ্কের ভার্সিটিতে অ্যাপ্লাই করতে লজ্জার কিছু নেই। আর র ্যাঙ্কের ব্যাপারটা রিলেটিভ। দিন শেষে আপনার স্কিলই অন্যদের থেকে আপনাকে আলাদা করবে। যাদের সিজিপিএ ৪.০০ তাদেরও অনেকে নিজের পছন্দের ভার্সিটিতে অ্যাডমিশন পান না। তাই বলে এমন ভার্সিটিতে অ্যাপ্লাই করা উচিৎ না যার বিন্দুমাত্র রেপুটেশন নেই। এসব ভার্সিটির ডিগ্রি ক্যারিয়ারকে পিছিয়ে দেবে। ভার্সিটির অ্যাক্রিডিটেশন সম্পর্কেও নিশ্চিত হওয়া উচিৎ। প্রথমে লো র ্যাঙ্কের স্কুলে পড়ে পরে সহজেই হায়ার র ্যাঙ্কের স্কুলে অ্যাডমিশন নিতে পারেন। আমার পরিচিত একজন তার ডিপার্টমেন্টে ফার্স্ট হয়েও ২.৭৫ একসেপ্ট করে এমন ভার্সিটিতে মাস্টার্স করেছিলেন। পরে আবারও জিআরই দিয়েছেন। পিএইচডি করছেন বোস্টনে যার সর্বশেষ র ্যাঙ্ক দেখেছিলাম ২৪। আমেরিকার অধিকাংশ ভার্সিটিই অ্যাপ্লিকেশন প্রসেস করার সময় সেগুলো সামগ্রিক বা হোলিস্টিকভাবে বিচার করে। তবুও অ্যাপ্লাই করার আগে নিশ্চিত হয়ে নিন যে তারা আসলেই অ্যাপ্লিকেশন এভাবে এভালুয়েট করবে কি না। প্রোগ্রাম কো-অর্ডিনেটরকে জিজ্ঞাসা করুন তারা সিজিপিএর ভিত্তিতে আগেই অ্যাপ্লিকেশন বাদ দিয়ে দেয় কি না। অনেক ভার্সিটি আছে যারা রিকুয়ারমেনট ফুলফিল না-হলে কন্ডিশনাল অ্যাডমিশন দেয়। সেখানে চেষ্টা করতে পারেন। তারা হয়তো এমন কন্ডিশন দিয়ে দেবে যে একটা নির্দিষ্ট সময় পর্যন্ত আপনাকে নির্দিষ্ট গ্রেড মেইনটেইন করতে হবে। অ্যাপ্লাই করার আগে কোঅর্ডিনেটরকে মেইল করে বিগত বছরগুলোর জিআরই এর কাটঅফ স্কোর জিজ্ঞাসা করে নিন। এতে কিছুটা আইডিয়া পাওয়া যাবে আপনার সম্ভবনা কেমন। প্রথমবারে রিজেক্টেড হলেও দমে না-গিয়ে পরেরবারে আবারও অ্যাপ্লাই করুন। গ্র্যাজুয়েট স্কুল খুবই কম্পিটিটিভ। হাজারো ভালো ভালো প্রোফাইলের ভিড়ে আপনারটা রিজেক্টেড হতেই পারে। স্প্রিং সেশনে ফান্ড কম থাকলেও মেইল করা উচিৎ। কে জানে, ওই কম ফান্ডের কিছু অংশ আপনার কপালে আছে কি না! আমেরিকায় ভার্সিটির কমতি নেই। প্রায় সাড়ে তিন হাজারের বেশি ভার্সিটি আছে। তাই মেইল করা, ভার্সিটি সার্চের ক্ষেত্রে কৃপণটা করবেন না। যে সাবজেক্টে আগে পড়েছেন সেটাতেই হায়ার স্টাডিজে যেতে হবে এমন কোনো মানে নেই। একটা সাবজেক্টের সাথে কানেক্টেড আরও অনেক সাবজেক্ট থাকে। ইকোনমিকসের বিকল্প হতে পারে ডেভেলপমেন্ট স্টাডিজ। ইংরেজির বিকল্প হতে পারে লিঙ্গুইসটিকস। অ্যানথ্রোপোলজি, হিস্ট্রির সাথে বোধহয় আর্কিওলজির সম্পর্ক রয়েছে। উল্লেখ্য, আর্কিওলজির একটা স্টেম সাবজেক্ট। ★বিগত বছরগুলোতে অ্যাডমিশন পেয়েছে এমন কয়েকটা লো প্রোফাইল: Prairie View A M University CGPA: 2.83 GRE: : 311 IELTS: 7.5 Florida International University CGPA: 2nd class 1st GRE: 301 (Quant 158, V 143, AW 2.5) IELTS: 6.5 Philadelphia University CGPA: 2.39 GRE: 323 (V-163, Q-160) IELTS: 8 Rowan Graduate School of Biomedical Science CGPA: 2.93 GRE: 305 (148.157) Saint Louis University BSc 2nd class IELTS: 7.5 GRE: 302 (V 147, Q 155, AWA 3) University of Tennesse- Knoxville CGPA: 2.98 7.0 (W-6.5, R-7.5, S-7.0, L-7.5) GRE: 303 (V-143, Q-160) Alabama A M University CGPA: 2.71 With 7 F s GRE: 305 IELTS: 6.5 CGPA: 2.98/4.00 Texas Tech University CGPA: 2.98 with four ‘F’ grades GRE: 318 (Quant: 163, Verbal: 155, AWA: 4) TOEFL: 114 (R: 29, W: 30, S: 28, L: 27) University of North Texas CGPA: (2nd Class) GRE: Verbal: 157, AWA: 4 TOEFL: 101(R: 24, W: 24, S: 30, L: 23) ★৩.০০ এর নিচে সিজিপিএ একসেপ্ট করে এমন কিছু ভার্সিটি: (সংগৃহীত) Arkansas State University 2.75 Arkansas Tech University 2.5 Bradley University 2.75 Cal Poly Pomona 2.5 California State University East Bay 2.5 California State University Fresno 2.75 California State University Fullerton 2.5 California State University Long Beach 2.7 California State University North Ridge 2.5 DePaul University 2.5 Eastern Michigan University 2.7 Gannon University 2.5 Humboldt State University 2.5 Jackson state university 2.5 Lamar University 2.5 Louisiana Tech University 2.5 McNeese State University 2.5 New Jersey Institute of Technology 2.8 Pennsylvania State University 2.75 Pittsburg State University 2.5 Texas A M University Kingsville 2.7 Texas State University San Marcos 2.75 University of Arkansas 2.5 University of Arkansas at Little Rock 2.7 University of Central Missouri 2.8 University Of Colorado Colorado Springs 2.7 University of Illinois Springfield 2.7 University of Louisiana at Lafayette 2.75 University of Memphis 2.5 University of South Alabama 2.5 University of South Dakota 2.7 University of Tennessee at Chattanooga 2.7 University of the District of Columbia 2.5 University of Wisconsin Milwaukee 2.75 Valparaiso University 2.00 Western Illinois University 2.75 Wright State University 2.7",

Main point হল part 1-এ আপনার length নিয়ে খুব বেশি চিন্তা করা উচিত নয়। আপনার use of English টাই সবচেয়ে বেশি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। নিচে কয়েকটি উপায় রয়েছে যা আপনি সহজেই আপনার answer গুলি কে short sentence থেকে আরও long sentence এ extend করতে পারেন যা comprehensive answer বলে consider হবে যা আরও ভাল শোনাবে এবং আশা করি আপনি higher score পাবেন৷ Feelings and Opinions আপনাকে এইমাত্র যে question টি জিজ্ঞাসা করা হয়েছে তা সম্পর্কে আপনি কেমন feel করছেন তা বলে আপনি easily আপনার answer টি extend করতে পারেন। এটি আপনার answer কে আরও interesting করে তুলবে। “What do you like to do in your spare time?” Short Answer : I like shopping. Long Answer : I like shopping because I love trying on new3 clothes and I always feel more confident when I’m wearing a new outfit.” Contrasting Details আপনার answer টি extend করার সবচেয়ে easy way মধ্যে একটি হল বিশদ বিবরণের contrast এ but শব্দটি ব্যবহার করা। “How long have you worked there?” Short Answer: “I’ve worked there for three years.” Long Answer: “I’ve worked there for three years, but I’m going to change careers next year.” Combining Details খুব Short Answer দেওয়ার পরিবর্তে আপনি and , with বা also এর সাথে কিছু extra details যোগ করতে পারেন। “Do you live in a flat or a house?” Short Answer: “I live in a house.” Long Answer: “I live in a house with my two brothers and mum. We’ve also got a cat and a bird.” Past Comparison আপনি কথা বলতে পারেন সেই বিষয়ে যা করতে আপনি অভ্যস্ত ( used to এবং বর্তমান সময়ে তা এখন কীভাবে change হয়েছে সে সম্পর্কে। “Do you play sport?” Short Answer: “ I play football.” Long answer: “I used to love basketball, but now I play football more because that’s what my friends are in to (বন্ধুরা জড়িত).’ Adding Reasons Exam এ আপনি কেন কিছু মনে করেন (why you think) তা সবসময় ব্যাখ্যা করার try করুন। আপনি because বা so ব্যবহার করে এটি করতে পারেন। “Do you like your job?” Short Answer: “Yes, I really love my job.” Long Answer: “yes, I really love my job because I get to help people with their problems every day.” Future যদি Future এ কিছু change হয়, আপনি future এর একটি structure ব্যবহার করতে পারেন, যেমন wil বা be + going to । “Do you work or study?” Short Answer: “I’m at university at the moment.” Long Answer: “I’m at university at the moment, but I’m graduating next year and I will hopefully get a job in advertising.” Contrast Opposite Opinions আপনাকে একটি question জিজ্ঞাসা করা হতে পারে যেখানে আপনাকে আপনার opinion বা another person’s opinion সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে হবে। আপনি উভয় পক্ষ consider করেছেন তা দেখানোর জন্য even so বা although ব্যবহার করুন। Is your hometown a nice place for tourists to visit? Short answer: Yes, it has a really nice beach. Longer answer: Yes, it has a really nice beach, although it is getting really busy these days, so it’s not as pristine as it used to be. Giving Examples Real life examples গুলি সর্বদা কথা বলার জন্য সবচেয়ে easy things কারণ আপনি সেগুলি সম্পর্কে naturally এবং in details কথা বলতে পারেন৷ Do you get along with your brothers? (ভাইয়ের সাথে একমত হওয়া) Short answer: No, we’re not in to the same things. Longer answer: No, we’re not in to the same things, like when we are both watching TV we always fight about what show to watch. Frequency আপনি usually , never , always এবং more often than not এর মতো word ব্যবহার করতে পারেন, আপনার উত্তর extend করতে। “What do you do at the weekends?” Short answer: “I watch TV and play computer games.” Longer answer: “I usually watch TV and play computer games, but sometimes I go out for a drink with my friends.” How can I use these? Best candidate রা speaking test এ naturally ইংরেজি use করেন। তারা মনে করে না যে Should I extend this with an example or talk about the future? কারণ তারা শুধু spontaneously উত্তর দেয়। আপনি এমন কিছু করে improve করতে পারেন যাকে আমি বলি slow and fast অনুশীলন বা practice। old exam এর question গুলির সাথে প্রথমে ধীরে ধীরে practice করুন এবং কীভাবে আপনি আপনার answer গুলিকে extend করতে পারেন এবং এমনকি আপনার সামনে notes এবং books রাখতে পারেন।আপনার answer গুলি perfectly পেতে কোন structure ব্যবহার করতে হবে সে সম্পর্কে deeply চিন্তা করুন তারপরে আপনি new question গুলির সাথে এবং কোনো help ছাড়াই fast অনুশীলন করতে পারেন, কেননা আমরা আশা করি, আপনি structure গুলি in detail অধ্যয়ন করেছেন, আপনি কোনও সাহায্য ছাড়াই স্বাভাবিকভাবে সেগুলি ব্যবহার করতে সক্ষম হবেন। Can I use more than one? Of course! তারা খুবই flexible। একটি single answer এর জন্য দুটি বা তিনটি structure combine করতে পারলে খুবই impressive হয়। Where are all the complicated structures? খুব কঠিন ‘complicated structures’ ব্যবহার করার জন্য try করা সাধারণত ভুলের দিকে পরিচালিত করে। মনে রাখবেন যে speaking test এর main goal হল examiner এর সাথে ‘effectively এবং fluently’ communicate করতে সক্ষম হওয়া। আপনি যদি complicated grammar structure এর কথা ভাবেন, তাহলে probably আপনি এই জিনিসগুলির কোনটিই করতে পারবেন না। আপনাকে range of structures ব্যবহার করতে হবে, কিন্তু এর অর্থ এই নয় যে আপনাকে ইংরেজি ভাষায় প্রতিটি complicated phrase এবং tense ব্যবহার করতে হবে। real communication এর উপর Focus করুন How can I practice?

Formally কথা বলার try করা যখন আমি পড়াতে শুরু করি তখন যে জিনিসটি আমাকে অবাক করেছিল তা হল কিছু student কতগুলি formal phrase ব্যবহার করেছিল। In my opinion এর মতো phrase এবং In modern life প্রতিটি sentence তেই রয়েছে বলে মনে হয়েছিল এবং moreover শব্দটি আমি আমার প্রথম class এ যতবার শুনেছি তা আমার পুরো জীবনে ততবার শুনি নাই। এটি Student দের দের সমালোচনা নয় তাদের যা শেখানো হয়েছে তাই তারা ব্যবহার করতে পারে বরং তাদের কীভাবে শেখানো হয়েছে সেটিও একটি important বিষয়। প্রতিটি course book এ in addition এবং incidentally এর মতো phrase রয়েছে এবং এগুলি ইংরেজি শেখার একটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ অংশ, তবে এগুলি খুব plain spoken English এ ব্যবহৃত হয় এবং formally বা Academic writing এর জন্য বেশি ব্যবহৃত হয়। এগুলি writing test এ ব্যবহার করার জন্য ভাল, কিন্তু speaking test এর জন্য সত্যিই suitable নয়। Speaking Test এ formal phrase ব্যবহার করা IELTS SPEAKING TEST মূলত দুই ব্যক্তির মধ্যে normal conversation কে represent করে এবং তাই আপনার খুব বেশি formal language ব্যবহার করা উচিত নয়। আপনি slang বা খুব বেশি informal language ও ব্যবহার করতে পারবেন না, শুধু plain English এ কথা বলবেন। equal status এর native speaker রা কীভাবে একে অপরের সাথে কথা বলে তা শুনুন; আপনি খুব কমই শুনতে পাবেন যে তারা খুব একটা formal language ব্যবহার করছে না। কিছু student believe করে যে নীচের বাম পাশের কলামের phrase গুলি ব্যবহার করলে examiner impressed হবে, কিন্তু আপনি তা যদি করেন তবে ভুল করলেন। বরং এটির কারণে examiner বুঝে যে আপনি কথা বলার জন্য একটি specific formula use করছেন এবং native speaker রা আসলে কীভাবে কথা বলে তা আপনি প্রকাশ করতে পারেননি। অন্য কথায়, আপনি সেগুলোর খুব বেশি ব্যবহার করে high score তুলতে পারবেন না তা বুঝা যায়। IELTS Speaking Marking Criteria IELTS Speaking Band Descriptors এর ‘Fluency and Coherence’ শিরোনামের অধীনে এটি বলা হয়েছে যে band 5.0 উত্তর করে ‘may over-use certain connectives and discourse markers‘। এটি দিয়ে এমন ব্যক্তিকে বোঝায় যিনি নীচের formal phrase গুলো অতিরিক্ত use করেন। চারটি marking criteria এর একটিতে band 5.0 পাওয়া মানে হচ্ছে বাকি ৩ টাই অনেক ভাল করলেও overall ভাল mark পাওয়া প্রায় অসম্ভব হয়ে উঠে। আমার অনেক ভালো IELTS Student রা যারা ক্লাসে চমৎকার grammar, vocabulary এবং pronunciation বুঝে, কিন্তু কথা বলতে বললে তারা প্রতিটি sentence এ formal phrase ব্যবহার করে বলে মনে হয় এবং এটাই প্রধান কারণ তারা ভালো score তুলতে না পারার। আমি কিভাবে informal phrase ব্যবহার এড়াতে পারি? আমি আপনাদেরকে সাহায্য করার জন্য নীচের Table টি তৈরি করেছি। বাম দিকের phrase গুলি speaking test এর জন্য খুবই formal এবং ডানদিকের phrase গুলি তার পরিবর্তে ব্যবহার করা উচিত৷ It is said that….

      "content_clean": "IELTS কথা বলার টিপস এই SPEAKING TIP গুলো আমি আমার সমস্ত IELTS STUDENT দের সাথে শেয়ার করি। আপনি Acasemic এবং general IELTS উভয় test এ speaking এর জন্য এই টিপসগুলি ব্যবহার করতে পারেন। Examiner-অনুমোদিত IELTS এর speaking টিপস সমূহ: 24 ঘন্টা ইংরেজিতে warm-up করুন আপনি কি কখনো ইংরেজি কয়েকদিন English Speaking না করে ইংরেজি ক্লাসে গিয়েছেন? প্রথম 10 মিনিটে আপনি সাধারণত কেমন feel করেন? বেশিরভাগ ছাত্রদের ‘warm-up’ করতে এবং তাদের ability অনুযায়ী পারফর্ম করতে 10-15 মিনিট সময় লাগে। ঠিক যেমন একজন Athlete sporting event এর আগে warm-up করে, কেননা আপনার correct level এ ফিরে আসতে আপনার বেশ সময় লাগে। আপনি যদি আপনার speaking test এর আগে warm-up না করেন, তাহলে আপনি কতটা ভাল তা examiner কে দেখানোর আগেই আপনার কথা শেষ হয়ে যাবে। এই কারণে, আপনার পরীক্ষার আগে 24 ঘন্টার জন্য শুধুমাত্র ইংরেজিতে কথা বলা, লিখতে, পড়া এবং শোনা উচিত । আপনার পরিবার এবং বন্ধুরা আপনাকে পাগল ভাবতে পারে, কিন্তু এটি সত্যিই আপনার score এর একটি বিশাল পার্থক্য আনবে। প্রতিদিন একটু ইংরেজি বলুন সারা সপ্তাহে আপনার স্থানীয় ভাষায় কথা বলার চেয়ে প্রতিদিন একটু অনুশীলন করা ভাল এবং তারপরে সপ্তাহে এক বা দুবার ইংরেজি ক্লাসে যাওয়ার চেয়ে। আপনি মনে করেন যে কিন্তু আমার সাথে অনুশীলন করার মতো কেউ নেই! আমি বুঝতে পারি যে আপনার Local Area তে practic করার জন্য তেমন Native Speaker পান না, কিন্তু ইন্টারনেট আপনার সাথে কথা বলতে ইচ্ছুক এমন বহু লোককেই আপনি পাবেন। আপনি যদি কোন কিছু বুঝতে না পারেন তবে Examiner কে জিজ্ঞাসা করতে ভয় পাবেন না আমার অনেক student আছে যারা মনে করে যে Examiner ই একমাত্র ব্যক্তি যিনি Speaking Test এ প্রশ্ন জিজ্ঞাসা করতে পারবেন। এটি মূলত দুই ব্যক্তির মধ্যে একটি normal conversation, তাই আপনি যদি বুঝতে না পারেন যে সে কী বোঝাচ্ছেন, তবে তাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করুন। আপনি তাদের একটি সম্পূর্ণ sentence ব্যাখ্যা করতে বলতে পারবেন না, তবে আপনি তাদের একটি specific word এর meaning ব্যাখ্যা করতে বলতে পারেন। শুধু বলুন ‘I’m sorry, could explain what X means?’ আপনি তাদের প্রশ্নটি repeat করতে বলতে পারেন যদি আপনি কী বলা হয়েছে তা পুরোপুরি বুঝতে না পারেন। শুধু বলুন ‘I’m sorry I didn’t quite get that, could you repeat the question please?’ যাইহোক, আপনার এই সুযোগের অপব্যবহার করা উচিত নয় এবং Examiner কে প্রতিটি word ব্যাখ্যা করতে এবং প্রতিটি প্রশ্নের repeat করতে বলা উচিত নয়। এটি অনুমোদিত নয় এবং সম্ভবত এতে করে examiner রাগান্বিত হতে পারে। আপনার যখন সত্যিই এটির প্রয়োজন তখন কেবল সাহায্যের জন্য জিজ্ঞাসা করুন। সম্পূর্ণ উত্তর দিন Yes এবং NO সন্তোষজনক উত্তর নয়। মনে রাখবেন এটি একটি Exam এবং আপনাকে Examiner কে দেখাতে হবে ইংরেজতে আপনি কেমন ভাল। আপনি যদি খুব সংক্ষিপ্ত উত্তর দেন, তাহলে Examiner বুঝতে পারবেন না আপনি কতটা ভালো। আপনি ব্যাখ্যা এবং উদাহরণ সহ আপনার Answer Extend করার try করা উচিত। আসুন এই প্রশ্নের জন্য ভাল এবং খারাপ example দেখি: ‘ What are the causes of traffic jams in your city?’ Bad Answer: ‘The causes of traffic jams are narrow roads and overpopulation.’ ট্রাফিক জ্যামের কারণ হচ্ছে সরু রাস্তা এবং অতিরিক্ত জনসংখ্যা। এই উত্তরটি খুবই সংক্ষিপ্ত এবং এটি examiner কে ন্যূনতম পরিমাণ information দিয়েছে। Good Answer: ‘The causes of congestion are narrow roads and overpopulation. This is because our roads were designed a long time ago when the population of the city was much lower. For example, the road near my house was built in the 1960s when the population was about a third of what it is today.’ সরু রাস্তা এবং অতিরিক্ত জনসংখ্যাই যানজটের কারণ। কারণ আমাদের রাস্তাগুলো অনেক আগে ডিজাইন করা হয়েছিল যখন শহরের জনসংখ্যা অনেক কম ছিল। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, আমার বাড়ির কাছের রাস্তাটি 1960-এর দশকে নির্মিত হয়েছিল যখন জনসংখ্যা ছিল প্রায় এক তৃতীয়াংশ যা আজকের মতো। এই Student টি শুধুমাত্র প্রশ্নের Answer দেয়নি বরং তারা কী বোঝায় তা ব্যাখ্যা করেছে এবং তার answer কে আরও সমর্থন করার জন্য একটি উদাহরণ দিয়েছে। কিভাবে সম্পূর্ণ উত্তর দিতে হয় সে সম্পর্কে আরও বিস্তারিত পাঠের জন্য অনুগ্রহ করে আমাদের IELTS speaking part 3 guide.দেখুন। আপনার কখনই answer গুলি মুখস্থ করা উচিত নয়, এটি একটি খুব খারাপ ধারণা কারন IELTS Examiner দের কে এগুলি সনাক্ত করার জন্য Training দেওয়া হয় এবং সেগুলি চিহ্নিত করতে তারা খুব expert। আপনি যদি examiner কে মুখস্থ উত্তর দেন তাহলে আপনি test এ ০ পেতে পারেন। তা সত্ত্বেও, কিছু নির্দিষ্ট ধরণের প্রশ্ন রয়েছে (topic নয়) যেগুলি always থাকে এবং আমরা সেগুলোর উত্তর দেওয়ার জন্য ব্যবহৃত functional language অধ্যয়ন করতে পারি এবং শিখতে পারি। Here is a list of the comment question types: giving examples; giving opinions; contrasting viewpoints; commenting on someone else’s opinion; talking about cause and effect; talking about hypothetical situations; talking about the past and future. এগুলি সম্পর্কে কথা বলার জন্য প্রয়োজনীয় grammar এবং functional language সম্পর্কে আরও details study এর জন্য, speaking part 3 common questions. বিষয়ে আমাদের Article টি দেখুন । Native English Speaker রা কীভাবে কথা বলে তা জানার Try করুন ইংরেজির teacher রা তাদের student দের সাথে খুব unnaturally ভাবে কথা বলার tendency রাখেন। তারা খুব ধীরে এবং জোর দিয়ে কথা বলে। আমি এটি আবিষ্কার করেছি যখন আমার ছাত্ররা কয়েকজন teacher এর সাথে কফি খেতে বেরিয়েছিল এবং তারা বিশ্বাস করতে পারেনি যে আমরা যখন ক্লাসের বাইরে যাইতাম এবং একে অপরের সাথে কথা বলতাম তখন আমাদের কথা কতটা আলাদাভাবে শোনাতো!!! তারা সব বলতো, আপনি আমাদের এইভাবে শেখান না কেন যেইভাবে এখন কথা বলছেন? যদি আপনার Teacher আপনার সাথে খুব ধীরগতিতে এবং অস্বাভাবিকভাবে কথা বলেন তবে তারা আপনাকে শেখাচ্ছেন না যে natural English speaking গুলি আসলে কেমন শোনাচ্ছে। YouTube যান এবং দুজন native speaker আসলে কীভাবে কথা বলে তা শুনুন। তারা linking words, sentence stress, and weak sounds এর মতো pronunciation বৈশিষ্ট্যগুলি ব্যবহার করে । এটি বুঝতে আরও কঠিন করে তোলে, তবে এটি এমন কিছু যা আপনাকে অভ্যস্ত করতে হবে যদি আপনি speaking এবং Listening উভয় Test এ high score করতে চান। আপনি কি Grammar বা Fluency তে ভালো? grammar হল set of rules যা ব্যাখ্যা করে যে কীভাবে একটি sentence এ word ব্যবহার করা হয়। fluency বলতে সহজে এবং smoothly কথা বলার ability কে বোঝায়। এই দুটি link করা হয়েছে কারণ যে student রা grammar সঠিক হওয়ার দিকে মনোনিবেশ করে তারা এতটা fluent হয় না কারণ তারা স্বাভাবিক গতিতে কথা বলার চেয়ে rules সম্পর্কে চিন্তা করার জন্য বেশি সময় spend করে। অন্য দিকে সেই student রা রয়েছে যারা খুব fluently কথা বলে, কিন্তু প্রচুর grammatical mistake করে। আমার অভিজ্ঞতায়, অধিকাংশ student হয় কোনো না কোনো specific বিষয়ে ভালো হয়; যাইহোক, সবসময় ব্যতিক্রম আছে। আপনার যা করা উচিত তা হল নিজের speaking record করা এবং তারপরে শোনা। আপনি কি প্রচুর grammatical mistake করছেন বা আপনি কি খুব ধীরে এবং unnaturally কথা বলেছেন? আপনি যদি অনেক grammatical mistake করে থাকেন, তাহলে প্রথমে এগুলো ঠিক করার দিকে মনোযোগ common grammar mistakes and how to avoid them দিন এবং আমাদের article টিও দেখা উচিত । বিগত Test এর Question নিয়ে চিন্তা করবেন না যখন আমি একটি নতুন IELTS কোর্স শুরু করি তখন ছাত্রদের দ্বারা প্রথম যে প্রশ্নগুলি আমি জিজ্ঞাসা করি তা হল ‘What are the common questions?’ অথবা ‘Where can I find past exam questions?’ IELTS test এর প্রশ্নপত্রের question গুলি খুব কমই repeat করা হয় এবং এটি অত্যন্ত unlikely যে আপনাকে একই প্রশ্ন জিজ্ঞাসা করা হবে যা অতীতের পরীক্ষাগুলিতে এসেছিল। তাই আপনি আপনার সময় নষ্ট করবেন না। আরেকটি বিষয় যা আমার বলা উচিত তা হল বিগত পরীক্ষার প্রশ্নগুলি খুব boring। যদি আপনি practice করার জন্য এগুলোই choice করেন তবে আপনি খুব দ্রুত bored হয়ে যেতে পারেন। তারচেয়ে আপনি যে বিষয়ে উত্সাহী সেই বিষয় নিয়ে কথা বলুন। আপনি যদি ফুটবল ভালোবাসেন, তবে সে সম্পর্কে কথা বলুন; আপনি ফ্যাশন ভালবাসেন, তবে সে সম্পর্কে কথা বলুন। আপনার আবেগ সম্পর্কে কথা বলা আপনাকে উন্নতি করতে সাহায্য করবে কারণ আপনি আসলে এটি সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে enjoy করবেন এবং আমরা যখন ভাল সময় কাটাই তখন আমরা আরও মজা করে শিখতে চাই। চিন্তা করার সময় Allowed অনেক student অভিযোগ যে তারা speaking test এ কোনো ভালো ধারণা নিয়ে ভাবতে পারে না। speaking test part 1 আপনার নিজের সম্পর্কে, তাই আপনার নিজের সম্পর্কে প্রশ্নের answer দেওয়ার জন্য আপনার সত্যিই কোন সময় লাগবে না। part 2-এ আপনাকে আপনার উত্তর প্রস্তুত করার জন্য সময় দেওয়া হবে, তাই এই বিষয়ে খুব বেশি চিন্তা করবেন না। part 3, এই অংশে শিক্ষার্থীরা সবচেয়ে বেশি ভয় পায় কারণ প্রশ্নগুলি আরও বেশি ‘challenging’ হয় এবং একটি ভাল উত্তর চিন্তা করতে কয়েক মুহূর্ত সময় নিতে পারে। এটি সম্পূর্ণ natural এবং এটি এমন কিছু যা আপনি সম্ভবত আপনার নিজের native language এ সব সময় করেন। গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় হল examiner কে জানাতে আপনার কিছু মুহুর্তের ভাবার জন্য নিচের কথাগুলো বলতে পারেন : গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় হল শুধুমাত্র এই কৌশলটি ব্যবহার করা যখন আপনাকে একেবারেই করতে হবে। আপনি যদি প্রতিটি বাক্য এভাবে শুরু করেন, তাহলে পরীক্ষক মনে করবে আপনি উত্তর মুখস্ত করে ফেলেছেন এবং আপনি ব্যর্থ হবেন। That’s a tricky question; let me think for a moment.’ ‘That’s an interesting question, let me think about that.’ ‘It’s very hard to say for sure, but I would guess….’, ‘It’s difficult to say, I believe….’ ‘I don’t really know for sure, but I believe….’ গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় হল শুধুমাত্র এই কৌশলটি ব্যবহার করবেন যখন নিতান্তই আপনার প্রয়োজন হবে। আপনি যদি প্রতিটি বাক্য এভাবে শুরু করেন, তাহলে examiner মনে করবে আপনি উত্তর মুখস্ত করে ফেলেছেন এবং আপনি খারাপ ফলাফল করবেন। তোমার ভুল গুলো Correct করোঃ লোকেরা যখন লম্বা সময় ধরে কথা বলে তখন প্রচুর ভুল করে, বিশেষ করে যখন তারা পরীক্ষায় nervous থাকে। Examiner এটি বোঝেন এবং আপনি যে কোন ভুল করলে সাথে সাথেই তা সংশোধন করা ভাল। কিছু student এটি করতে পছন্দ করে না কারণ তারা মনে করে এটি examiner এর কাছে স্পষ্ট করে দিচ্ছে যে আপনি ভুল করেছেন। চিন্তা করবেন না, আপনি কখন ভুল করেছেন examiner তা খুব সহজেই বুঝতে পারে এবং সেগুলি সংশোধন করা examiner কে দেখায় যে আপনি সত্যিই ভাল grammar জানেন। আপনি যখন একটি ছোট ভুল করেন, তখন কেবল sorry বলুন এবং sentence টি সঠিকভাবে repeat করুন। কখনই Scripted Answer শিখবেন না আমি এটি ইতিমধ্যেই বলেছি, তবে এটি এত বড় ভুল যে এটি একাধিকবার বলাও মূল্যবান। যদি একজন teacher আপনাকে answer মুখস্ত করতে বললে, মনে রাখবেন সেই teacher জানে না যে তিনি কি বিষয়ে কথা বলছেন এবং আপনার একজন নতুন teacher খুঁজে বের করা উচিত। এছাড়াও, আপনি যদি একটি textbook বা website পড়েন যা আপনাকে কিছু Scripted Answer শিখতে পরামর্শ দেয়, তাহলে সেই বইটি dust bin এর মধ্যে ফেলে দিন এবং সেই website এ ভুলেও যাবেন না। Script শেখা BAND 0 পাওয়ার পথে আপনাকে অগ্রসর করবে। তারচেয়ে, আপনার speaking ability improvement এর দিকে মনোনিবেশ করা উচিত, যাতে আপনি সাধারণভাবে exam এ এবং জীবনের যেকোনো situation এ response করতে সক্ষম হোন। Keep it Simple Student দের grammar এবং vocabulary কতটা দুর্দান্ত তা দেখানোর চেষ্টা করা student দের সবচেয়ে বড়। এর দ্বারা, আমি বুঝিয়েছি অনেকে advanced vocabulary এবং grammatical structure ব্যবহার করার try করে যা তারা সঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার করতে জানে না। আপনি যদি ভুলভাবে word ব্যবহার করেন তবে আপনি marks হারাবেন। তাই long complex word এর চেয়ে easy word ব্যবহার করা ভালো। আমি আমার student দের বলছি 100% rule অনুসরণ করতে- যদি সে একটি word সম্পর্কে 100% নিশ্চিত হয়। আর যদি word সম্পর্কে পরিপূর্ণ ধারণা না থেকে তবে IELTS test এ এটি ব্যবহার করবেন না। 100% দ্বারা আমি বলতে চাচ্ছি যে আপনি বুঝতে পেরেছেন: meaning how it can be used correctly in a sentence collocations synonyms and antonyms. আপনি যদি এই জিনিসগুলি না জানেন তবে Easy Word ব্যবহার করুন। একই ভাবে grammar এর জন্য যায় খুব complex structure ব্যবহার করার চেষ্টা করা এবং আমি বলি ভুল করার চেয়ে general structure ব্যবহার করা ভাল। এমনকি যদি আপনি একটি ছোট ভুল করেন যে বাক্যটি ত্রুটি-মুক্ত নয় বলে গণনা করা হয় এবং এর জন্য আপনার মূল্যবান চিহ্ন খরচ হয়। Simple sentence কী এবং complex sentence কী তা নিয়েও প্রচুর confusion রয়েছে। সত্য হচ্ছে যে complex sentence আসলে complex নয়। আরও তথ্যের জন্য how to write a complex sentence দেখুন । যেকোনো উত্তর মোটেও না দেওয়ার চেয়ে কিছু উত্তর দেওয়ার চেষ্টা করা ভালো সম্প্রতি আমার একজন ছাত্র reading, writing এবং listening এ 8 পেয়েছে, কিন্তু speaking test এ মাত্র 5 পেয়েছে। কেন? তিনি বেশ কয়েকটি প্রশ্নের উত্তর দেননি, কারণ তিনি উত্তর সম্পর্কে নিশ্চিত ছিলেন না। আমি বেশিরভাগ এশিয়া থেকে আসা শিক্ষার্থীদের পড়াই এবং তাদের মধ্যে অনেকেই answer সম্পর্কে নিশ্চিত না হওয়া পর্যন্ত ক্লাসে answer দেওয়ার চেষ্টা করে না। এটি ক্লাসরুমের পরিবেশে স্বাভাবিক, তবে IELTS SPEAKING TEST এ এটি গ্রহণযোগ্য নয়। আপনাকে answer দেওয়ার চেষ্টা করতে হবে। চিন্তা করবেন না যদি আপনার কোন idea না থাকে কিভাবে প্রশ্নের answer দিবেন, অনুগ্রহ করে শুধু কিছু answer দেওয়ার try করুন। আপনি কিছু না বললে, Examiner আপনাকে সেই নির্দিষ্ট প্রশ্নের জন্য low score দিবেন। ANSWER করার জন্য একটি bad attempt উত্তর মোটেও না দেওয়ার চেয়ে অনেক ভাল। There’s Nothing Wrong with Your Accent অনেক students মনে করে যে IELTS SPEAKING TEST এ HIGH SCORE পাওয়ার best উপায় হল কেবল british বা American accent গ্রহণ করা। এটি ঠিক নয়, আপনি আপনার মতো just fluently কথা বলার try করবেন। English is a truly global language এবং হাজার হাজার বিভিন্ন accents এ কথা বলা হয়। সত্যি বলতে কি, যুক্তরাজ্যে প্রতি 20 কিলোমিটারে accent পরিবর্তিত হয়। Finish Strongly foreign ভাষায় কথা বলা boring হতে পারে। বেশির ভাগ শিক্ষার্থীকে সাধারণত একবারে কয়েক মিনিটের বেশি সময় ধরে কথা বলতে হয় না এবং তারা পরীক্ষার 3 parts এ কথা বলতে বলতে সত্যিই ক্লান্ত হয়ে পড়ে এবং এটি তাদের উত্তরগুলিকে affect করে। অতএব, আপনাকে দীর্ঘ সময়ের জন্য কথা বলার অভ্যাস করা উচিত। আপনি কমপক্ষে 30 মিনিটের জন্য অন্য ব্যক্তির সাথে normal conversation এ অভ্যস্ত হোন। part 3-এ আপনার Answer গুলিকে সত্যিই extend করার জন্য আপনার try করা উচিত। part 3 হল সবচেয়ে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ অংশ এবং tired student রা প্রায়শই খুব ছোট answer দেয় এবং আশা করে যে যত দ্রুত test শেষ করা যায়। Control Your Nerves Nervous Student রা বেশি ভুল করে, worse pronunciation করে এবং খুব quietly কথা বলে। আপনার test এর আগের রাতে তাড়াতাড়ি ঘুমাতে যান এবং নিশ্চিত করুন যে আপনি একটি ভাল খাবার খেয়েছেন এবং পরীক্ষার দিনে প্রচুর পরিমাণে জল পান করছেন। Exam Centre এ তাড়াতাড়ি পৌঁছানো নিশ্চিত করুন। আপনি যদি দেরি করেন তবে আপনি আরও বেশি nervous feel করবেন। মনে রাখবেন examiner চান যে আপনি test এ ভাল করুন। বিশ্বাস করুন, examiner ভাল student এর কথা শুনতে চান এবং তাতে বিরক্তবোধ করেন না। পরিষ্কারভাবে কথা বলার try করুন।। examiner এর সাথে জোরে কথা বলবেন না, তবে আপনি যা বলছেন তা তারা যাতে স্পষ্টভাবে বুঝতে পারে তা নিশ্চিত করুন। Finally, মাথায় রাখুন যে এই article টি পড়ে আপনি প্রমাণ করেছেন যে আপনি কঠোর পরিশ্রম করতে প্রস্তুত এবং তাই আপনি বেশিরভাগ লোকের চেয়ে এগিয়ে আছেন যারা পরীক্ষা দেয় এবং তাই আপনার নিজের উপর আস্থা থাকা উচিত।",

Examiner কে প্রতিটি question এর repeat করতে বলবেন না। প্রতিটি প্রশ্নের জন্য একটি করে word ব্যাখ্যা করতে examiner কে জিজ্ঞাসা করবেন না। যখন আপনার সত্যিই এটি প্রয়োজন তখনই এটি ব্যবহার করুন। আপনাকে সাহায্য করার জন্য examiner এর help এর আশায় থাকবেন না। তারা তা করবে না যদি না আপনি তাদের না বলেন এবং তারপরে যতটা তাদের অনুমতি দেওয়া হয়। নিজেকে চিন্তা করার জন্য আরও সময় দেওয়ার জন্য কেবল প্রশ্নটি repeat করবেন না। #যা করবেন আপনি বুঝতে না পারলে Examiner কে question টি repeat করতে বলুন। আপনি যদি কোন word এর meaning না জানেন তবে examiner সেটির explain করতে বলবেন। প্রতিটি প্রশ্নের উত্তর দেওয়ার চেষ্টা করুন, কিছু না করার চেয়ে কিছু চেষ্টা করা ভাল। নিচের কিছু phrase ব্যবহার করুন। আমি কীভাবে examiner কে জিজ্ঞাসা করব? অনেক শিক্ষার্থীর problem হল examiner কে politely জিজ্ঞাসা করতে না পারা যা আপনার ইংরেজির ability কে প্রদর্শন করে। অনেকে কেবল examiner দের মুখের দিকে confustion look এ তাকায়া থাকে। অন্যরা হয়তো sentence বা word repeat করতে থাকে যা তারা জানে না- আবার examiner ও বুঝে না যে আপনি কী বোঝাতে চেয়েছেন এবং আপনি specifically তাদের জিজ্ঞাসা না করলে তারা আপনাকে সাহায্য করবে না। আপনি যা করেন তা হল what? বা huh? বলা; এটি শুধুমাত্র poor English ই না বরং impolite ও বটে। নীচে এমন কিছু phrase দেওয়া হল যেগুলি কেবল polite ই নয়, বরং ইংরেজির বেশ high level কে demonstrate করে৷ আপনি যদি এই phrase গুলিকে একাধিকবার ব্যবহার করেন তবে আপনার উচিত হল পরিবর্তন করে করে ব্যবহার কর। Examiner কে প্রশ্নটি repeat করতে বলার ক্ষেত্রে…… I’m sorry I didn’t quite (catch/get) that, can you say that again please? Can you repeat the question please? Sorry, could you repeat the question please? Examiner কে word এর ব্যাখ্যা করতে বলার ক্ষেত্রে……… I’m sorry but I don’t quite understand the word (X); can you explain it to me? I’m a little confused about the word (X); can you tell me what it means? Sorry, can you explain what (X) means? যদি আমি এরপরও বুঝতেনা পারি? part 1 এর সমস্ত প্রশ্নগুলি familiar topics এর উপর তাই এটি খুব সহজেই answer করতে পারেন৷ part 3-এ আরও abstract প্রশ্ন রয়েছে, তাই সেগুলি একটু বেশি difficult হতে পারে। important বিষয় হল আপনি অন্তত কিছু answer করার try করুন। প্রায়শই examiner part 3-এ আপনার ইংরেজি শেষ limit পর্যন্ত পরীক্ষা করার try করবেন, তাই কিছু প্রশ্ন খুব কঠিন মনে হলে চিন্তা করবেন না। আপনি যদি প্রশ্নটি বুঝতে না পারেন তবে একটি strategy আপনি ব্যবহার করতে পারেন তা হল নিজে নিজে চিন্তা করার জন্য কিছু অতিরিক্ত সময় দেওয়া এবং তারপর answer দেওয়া। এর তিনটি পর্যায় রয়েছে: question এর Paraphrase করা examiner কে সরাসরি বলুন আপনি সত্যিই এই প্রশ্নের answer জানেন না answer করার try করুন উদাহরণ স্বরূপ: Question: How has the internet changed TV viewing habits in your country? প্রশ্ন: Internet কীভাবে আপনার দেশে Tv দেখার habit পরিবর্তন করেছে? Answer: Do people watch TV differently now because of the internet? That’s an interesting question, let me think for a second. If I had to give an answer I would say……. উত্তর: Internet এর কারণে মানুষ কি এখন differently টিভি দেখে? এটি একটি interesting question, আমাকে এক second এর জন্য ভাবতে দিন। I would say……. প্রশ্নটি paraphrase করা Paraphrasing হল প্রশ্নটিকে ভিন্নভাবে বলা, কিন্তু same meaning রাখা। উদাহরণস্বরূপ আপনাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করা যেতে পারে ‘How effective is public transport in your city?’ বা ‘আপনার শহরে গণপরিবহন কতটা effective? এবং আপনি এটিকে পুনরায় re-phrase করতে পারেন ‘How good are buses and trains here?’ বা এখানে বাস এবং ট্রেন কতটা ভালো? এটি আপনাকে কেবল আপনাকে চিন্তা করার জন্য অতিরিক্ত সময়ই দেয় না বরং examiner ও বুঝতে পারে যে আপনি জানেন কীভাবে paraphrase করতে হয় যা আপনার score কে বাড়িয়ে দিতে পারে। আবার, আপনার প্রতিটি প্রশ্নের ক্ষেত্রেই এটি করা উচিত নয়, যখন আপনার প্রয়োজন কেবল তখনি ব্যবহার করা উচিত। Examiner কেব লুন যে আপনি জানেন না Examiner রা এটি expect করেন না যে আপনি প্রতিটি প্রশ্নের উত্তর দিতে পারবেন, তবে তারা আশা করেন যে আপনি কিছু উত্তর কমপক্ষে দিতে পারবেন। এখানে কিছু phrase রয়েছে যা আপনি এর জন্য ব্যবহার করতে পারেন: That’s a difficult/interesting/tricky question, let me think for a second. I’ve never thought about that before, please give me a second. I’m going to have to think about that one for a few seconds. I’ve really no idea, just give me a moment. Examiner আরও বেশি impressed হবেন যদি আপনি তাদের সাথে honest থাকেন এবং তাদের বলবেন যে আপনাকে যে প্রশ্নটি জিজ্ঞাসা করা হয়েছে সেটি সম্পর্কে আপনি sure নন। আপনার খুব বেশিক্ষণ চিন্তা করা উচিত নয়, কয়েক second এর মধ্যেই স্থির করা উচিত। আপনি যদি কয়েক সেকেন্ড পরও উত্তর মনে করতে না পারেন, তবে শুধু normally একবার যুক্তিসঙ্গত answer এর try করুন। Answer এর try করুন finally, আপনাকে কয়েক ধরণের answer দিতে হবে। আপনি এটির ability অর্জন করতে পারেন এবং examiner কে জানাতে পারেন যে আপনি এই question সম্পর্কে sure নন এবং এই phrase গুলির ব্যবহার করে অনুমানের মাধ্যমে answer দেওয়ার try করা: if I had to say…. Off the top of my head…. Without knowing too much about this topic, I would say…. If I was forced to say I guess…… আবারও বলছি, শুধুমাত্র এই phrase গুলি তখনি ব্যবহার করুন যখন একেবারেই খুউউব বেশি প্রয়োজন হবে।",

IELTS EXAMINER আপনার কাছে তাৎক্ষণিক Answer দিয়ে ফেলবেন এমনটা আশা করেন না, আপনি Robot নন! যাইহোক, তারা আশা করে যে আপনি খুব naturally response করবেন। চিন্তা করার সময় নেওয়ার জন্য Native Speaker দের জন্য নির্দিষ্ট words এবং phrases ব্যবহার করা সম্পূর্ণ normal বিষয়। আপনি সম্ভবত আপনার নিজের ভাষা বলার সময়ো এমন করে থাকেন। ব্যবহার করা যেতে পারেএমন কিছু phrases: That’s a difficult question, let me think for a second. That’s a very interesting question, let me think. It’s very difficult to know exactly, but I think/but I believe/perhaps…. It’s difficult to say, I think…. I don’t really know for sure, but I would say…. সবচেয়ে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় এই phrase গুলো অতিরিক্ত ব্যবহার করা যাবে না। কিছু students তাদের প্রতিটি উত্তরের আগে এই phrase গুলো ব্যবহার করে এবং এটি সত্যিই unnatural শোনায়। মনে রাখবেন, যখন আপনি কঠিন প্রশ্ন পান তখনই কেবল এগুলি ব্যবহার করা হবে। আমি কিভাবে আমার উত্তর extend করব? অনেক student চিন্তিত থাকেন যে তারা part 3 তে কিছু বলতে পারবেন না বা বলার মতো যথেষ্ট কথা থাকবে না। Part 3 তে- বেশিরভাগ ক্ষেত্রে কোন একটি বিষয়ে আপনার general thought জানতে চাইবেন; advantage এবং disadvantage গুলি; problem এবং solution; অতীত থেকে এখন পর্যন্ত problem টি কীভাবে পরিবর্তিত হয়েছে; এবং ভবিষ্যতে সমস্যা কিভাবে পরিবর্তিত হবে। তাই health, economy, education এবং environment এর মতো সাধারণ দৈনন্দিন বিষয়গুলিতে আপনার মতামত সম্পর্কে চিন্তাভাবনা করা এবং কথা বলার practice করা উচিত। Part 3 তে ভাল করার জন্য কোন নির্দিষ্ট word limit নাই, তবে এটি খুব short এবং খুব long হওয়া উচিত নয়। খুব সংক্ষিপ্ত হলে আপনি আপনার উত্তর সঠিকভাবে develop করতে ব্যর্থ হবেন; আবার খুব দীর্ঘ হলে আপনি বিষয়ের বাইরে যেতে পারেন এবং/অথবা ভুল করতে পারেন। আমি কৌশল হিসেবে বলি যে, 3-4 sentence এ উত্তর দেওয়ার চেষ্টা করাই ভাল। কৌশল #1- paraphrase question আপনার উত্তর extend করার একটি ভাল উপায় হল examiner এর প্রশ্নের একটি paraphrase দিয়ে উত্তর দেওয়া। Paraphrasing হল যখন আপনি বাক্যটি repeat করেন তখন synonyms ব্যবহার করা যাতে একই meaning থাকে। এই কৌশলটি খুবই effective কারণ এটি আপনাকে কেবল normal way তে চিন্তা করার সময় দেয় না, বরং এই বিষয়টি প্রশ্নের উত্তর দেওয়ার জন্য আপনার mind focus কেউ স্থির করে। উদাহরণ স্বরূপ: Examiner: What can people do to try and reduce water pollution? পরীক্ষক : water pollution কমাতে মানুষ কী করতে পারে? Student: So, what can individuals do to ensure water is kept clean? I think…. ছাত্র : তাহলে, পানি পরিষ্কার রাখার জন্য মানুষজন কী করতে পারে? আমি মনে করি…. Examiner: How can events like the Olympics improve international relations?পরীক্ষক : অলিম্পিকের মতো ইভেন্ট কীভাবে International Relation এর উন্নতি করতে পারে? Student: Hmmmm, how can sport bring people from different countries closer together? I believe… ছাত্র : হুমমম, খেলাধুলা কীভাবে বিভিন্ন দেশের মানুষকে একত্রিত করতে পারে? আমি বিশ্বাস করি… আবার, এটি প্রতিটি answer এর জন্য ব্যবহার করা উচিত নয় এবং শুধুমাত্র যখন আপনি এটি উপযুক্ত মনে করেন ঠিক তখনি কেবল use করতে পারেন। কৌশল #2- বিষয় টিকে নহয় বা ঘটে তা explain করুন অনেক student তাদের মতামত প্রকাশ করে কিন্তু কেন তা হয় বা ঘটে তা তারা বলতে পারে না ফলে তাদের উত্তর extend হয় না। কিছু ছাত্র আমাকে বলেছে যে তারা examiner কে patronize করতে ভয় পায় এবং ধরে নেয় যে তারা কেন তাদের মতামত প্রকাশ করেছে তা তিনি জানতে পারবেন। ধরেই নিন যে examiner এর বিষয়টি সম্পর্কে কোনও জ্ঞান নেই। ভান করুন আপনি এমন একটি শিশুর সাথে কথা বলছেন যে বিষয়টি সম্পর্কে কিছুই জানে না এবং এটি আপনাকে আপনার অনুভূতি কেমন হয় বিষয়টি সম্পর্কে তা ব্যাখ্যা করতে সহায়তা করবে। উদাহরণ: Examiner: What can people do to reduce water pollution? পরীক্ষক: water pollution কমাতে মানুষ কী করতে পারে? Student: I believe the best way to keep water clean is to curb water use at home. (Why?) The vast majority of water is used in the home, (why?), for cooking, cleaning and washing, (why?) therefore by reducing the amount of water we use, (why?) the government can conserve the water supply and keep it clean. ছাত্র : আমি বিশ্বাস করি পানি পরিষ্কার রাখার সর্বোত্তম উপায় হল বাড়িতে জলের ব্যবহার রোধ করা। (কেন?) বেশিরভাগ পানি বাড়িতে ব্যবহার করা হয়, (কেন?), রান্না, পরিষ্কার এবং ধোয়ার জন্য, (কেন?) তাই আমরা যে পরিমাণ জল ব্যবহার করি তা হ্রাস করে, (কেন?) সরকার সংরক্ষণ water supply conserve করতে পারে এবং পরিষ্কার রাখতে পারে। নিজেদেরকে কেন জিজ্ঞাসা করে আমরা আমাদের opinion ব্যাখ্যা করতে থাকি এবং এটি আরও developed answer এর দিকে নিয়ে যায়। কৌশল #3- উদাহরণ দিন Example দেওয়া একটি সুস্পষ্ট বিষয় কিন্তু এটি অনেক শিক্ষার্থী করে না। সত্যিই আপনার উত্তর extend করার জন্য সাধারণত উদাহরণ প্রয়োজন হয়। আমার অনেক ছাত্র অভিযোগ করে যে তারা কোন উদাহরণ জানে না বা ভাবতে পারে না। আপনি যদি একটির কথা ভাবতে না পারেন তবে নতুন একটি উদাহরণ নিজের মতো তৈরি করুন। আপনি একটি উদাহরণ বানিয়ে বলার জন্য কোন marks হারাবেন না, বরঞ্চ এটি একটি ভাল developed উত্তর দেওয়ার জন্য আপনাকে marks অর্জনের দিকে নিয়ে যাবে। একটি ভাল কৌশল হল একটি newspaper এর articles বা recent research থেকে উদাহরণ ব্যবহার করা। উদাহরণ: Examiner: Have the modes of transport people use in your country changed much over the last few decades? পরীক্ষক : গত কয়েক দশক ধরে আপনার দেশে মানুষের পরিবহনের পদ্ধতি কি অনেক বদলে গেছে? Student: Absolutely, they have changed a lot. In the past most people used bicycles, but now they predominantly use motorbikes. For example, a recent survey found that 72% of people in Ho Chi. Minh City now own a motorbike. I just made that statistic up and it is perfectly acceptable for you to do the same thing in the IELTS speaking test. The examiner will never disagree with you or ask you to prove any of your examples. ছাত্র: অবশ্যই , সেগুলো অনেক বদলে গেছে। অতীতে বেশিরভাগ মানুষ সাইকেল ব্যবহার করলেও এখন তারা প্রধানত মোটরবাইক ব্যবহার করে। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, একটি সাম্প্রতিক সমীক্ষায় দেখা গেছে যে Ho Chi. Minh City তে 72% মানুষ প্রত্যেকে একটি করে মোটরবাইকের মালিক। আমি এইমাত্র পরিসংখ্যান তৈরি করেছি এবং IELTS speaking test এ এই ধরনের জিনিস করা আপনার পক্ষে পুরোপুরি গ্রহণযোগ্য। examiner কখনই আপনার সাথে দ্বিমত পোষণ করবেন না বা আপনাকে আপনার উদাহরণগুলির কোনো প্রমাণ করতে বলবেন না। কৌশল #4- Concessions করুন আমরা concession করতে পারি যে আমাদের মতামতের সীমা আছে বা যুক্তির আরো অন্য দিক থাকতে পারে। আমরা concession বা ছাড় দিতে ‘however’, ‘on the other hand’ এবং ‘despite this’ এর মতো শব্দ ব্যবহার করি। কিছু student এটি করা পছন্দ করে না কারণ তারা মনে করে এটি তাদের যুক্তি বা মতামতকে দুর্বল করে দেয়। আসলে, আপনি অন্য মতামত সম্পর্কে সচেতন তা দেখিয়ে আপনি আসলে আপনার যুক্তিকে শক্তিশালী করেন। উদাহরণ: Examiner: To what extent do you think advertising affects people’s shopping habits? পরীক্ষক : advertisement মানুষের কেনাকাটার অভ্যাসকে কতটা প্রভাবিত করে বলে আপনি মনে করেন? Student: Personally, I don’t think that it affects the way people shop at all. When people need something, they make up their own mind rather than thinking about adverts. However, it must have some influence, if companies pay lots of money for ads. ছাত্র : Personally, আমি মনে করি না যে এটি আদৌ লোকেদের কেনাকাটা করার পদ্ধতিকে প্রভাবিত করে। যখন লোকেদের কিছু কেনার প্রয়োজন হয় তখন তারা বিজ্ঞাপনের কথা চিন্তা না করে নিজেই নিজের মনস্থির করে। যাইহোক, এর কিছু প্রভাব থাকতে পারতো, যদি কোম্পানিগুলি বিজ্ঞাপনের জন্য প্রচুর অর্থ প্রদান করে। পরবর্তী পদক্ষেপ এই নির্দেশিকা পড়া আপনাকে সাহায্য করবে না যদি না আপনি idea গুলি নিজে নিজে practice না করেন। part 3 এর প্রতিটি প্রশ্ন আলাদা এবং তাই আলাদা response প্রয়োজন। যতটা সম্ভব স্বাভাবিকভাবে উত্তর দেওয়ার চেষ্টা করুন এবং প্রয়োজনে আপনার উত্তর extend করতে উপরের strategy গুলি ব্যবহার করুন। কোন magic formula নেই, তাই কিছু example question খুঁজুন এবং practice করুন এবং সাথে সাথে উত্তরগুলি রেকর্ড করেন এবং তারপরে আপনি শুনেন এবং আপনার ভুলগুলি চিহ্নিত করেন। আমি আশা করি যে এই post এর tips আপনাকে সমস্ত examiner এর question এর developed answer দিতে সাহায্য করবে। এখন বেশি বেশি practice করুন।",

      "content_clean": "Speaking part 1 মূলত 4-5 মিনিটের মত হয় এবং আপনাকে familiar topic গুলি সম্পর্কে question করা হবে, যেমন: Your job Your family Your home Your hometown Your hobbies লক্ষ্য করুন যে এই question গুলি আপনার সম্পর্কে । এটি অন্য দুটি part এর(part 2 3) তুলনায় easy বলে মনে করা হয় কারণ abstract topic গুলির চেয়ে নিজের সম্পর্কে কথা বলা অনেক সহজ, কিন্তু এর মানে এই নয় যে এটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ নয়। আপনি যে best possible way তে আপনার speaking test শুরু করবেন তা নিশ্চিত করার জন্য নীচে 5টি Dos and Don’ts অর্থাৎ ৫ টি করণীয় এবং ৫ টি বর্জনীয় কাজের list: Do # 1- Know What to Expect আপনি probably একটু nervous feel করবেন এবং আপনি এমন কোনো surprise চান না যা আপনাকে আরও বেশি anxious করে তুলবে, তাই আপনাকে অবশ্যই careful হতে হবে যে আপনি যখন room ঢুকবেন তখন exactly what will happen! part 1 শুরু হওয়ার আগে চারটি জিনিস ঘটবে। Examiner নিজেদের পরিচয় দিবেন এবং আপনাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করবেন, “What your name is.” আপনি simply উত্তর দিতে পারেন My name’s _______ । make sure that আপনি name is এর পরিবর্তে contraction name’s ব্যবহার করছেন। এটি আপনাকে exam এর বাকি অংশে contraction এর ব্যবহার করার কথা মনে করিয়ে দেবে (যেমন I’m, We’d, they’ll) examiner তখন আপনাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করবেন What can I you? । আপনি simply বলতে পারেন You can call me _______ । আপনার যদি একটি English নাম থাকে তবে এটি ব্যবহার করা ভাল, তবে আপনি এটি সঠিকভাবে উচ্চারণ করেছেন তা নিশ্চিত করুন। আপনি যদি আপনার নিজের নামটি সঠিকভাবে বলতে না পারেন তবে এটি “best first impression” তৈরি করবে না। যদি unsure থাকেন, তবে শুধু আপনার normal নাম ব্যবহার করুন। তারপর তারা আপনাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করবে “Where are you from?”। শুধু বলুন I’m from _____ । at this stage, আপনার Answer সম্পর্কে কোনো extra Information দেওয়ার প্রয়োজন নেই। Examiner অবশেষে আপনার identification দেখতে চাইবে। তাদের আপনার identification দেখান এবং তারপর test শুরু হতে পারে। এই চারটি জিনিস ঘটবে জেনে আপনি আরও বেশী confident হবেন এবং exam ভালোভাবে শুরু করবেন। Do # 2- Create a Good First Impression আমার Student রা প্রায়ই আমাকে জিজ্ঞেস করে, তারা যদি হাসে, friendly হয় এবং examiner যদি good eye contact করে, তাহলে কি বেশি mark পাওয়ার সম্ভাবনা আছে? Answer হল no এবং yes। Marking Criteria তে এমন কিছু নেই যা বলে যে সুন্দর হওয়া, বা examiner এর দিকে তাকানো আপনার marks কে improve করবে। যাইহোক, confident হওয়া আপনাকে help করবে কারণ এটি আপনার answer গুলির উপর effect ফেলে। যাইহোক, আপনি যদি examiner এর সাথে open এবং friendly হন তবে আপনি natural sounding answer দিতে পারবেন সহজেই। Eye contact অতিরিক্ত বা lengthy করবেন না। এটি সত্যিই strange লাগে যখন কেউ আপনাকে 15 মিনিট ধরে টানা আপনার চোখের দিকে তাকায়া থাকে। pretend করুন যে আপনি একজন friend এর সাথে normal conversation করছেন। Do # 3- Pretend You’re Interested in the Questions আসুন face করি, বেশিরভাগ IELTS questions সত্যিই boring। আপনি যদি কাউকে boring question এর answer দেন তবে আপনি একটি জিনিস লক্ষ্য করবেন- তাদের কণ্ঠস্বর একঘেয়ে অর্থাৎ এটির pitch উপরে বা নিচে যায় না, এটি খুব flat শোনায়। আপনি যদি এইভাবে কথা বলেন তবে আপনি pronunciation এর জন্য lower marks পাবেন কারণ আপনাকে test করা হবে এমন একটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় হল Intonation বা স্বরের উঠানামা। যখন native speaker রা কথা বলেন, তখন তাদের কণ্ঠস্বর naturally উঠানামা করে এবং তারা কেমন অনুভব করে তা depnd করে কণ্ঠস্বরের উঠানামার উপর। Imagine করুন আপনার class এ যেতে জন্য late হয়ে গেছে, আপনি class এর দিকে যাচ্ছেন এবং Teacher আপনাকে falling tone এ বলছেন Sit down, please। তিনি সম্ভবত তার tone বা স্বর দ্বারা আপনাকে বুঝাতে চাচ্ছে যে তারা আপনার lack of punctuality নিয়ে খুব খুশি নয়। যাইহোক, যদি তারা শুরুতে rising tone বা স্বরে এটি বলে, তবে তারা সম্ভবত আপনাকে বলবে যে ‘আপনি দেরি করেছেন’ এই আমি mind করিনি এবং আপনাকে দেখে খুশি হয়েছি। একইভাবে, আপনি যদি prtetend করেন যে examiner যা বলছেন তাতে আপনি interested, আপনার tone বা স্বরে আরও variation হওয়া উচিত। যাইহোক, সতর্কতা অবলম্বন করুন যাতে এটি অতিরিক্ত না হয় এবং আপনার কণ্ঠস্বর really high বা really low কেননা তা না হলে আপনার কণ্ঠস্বর পাগলের মতো শোনাবে। Native Speaker দের কথপকথন শোনা এবং তাদের স্বর copy করা আপনাকে natural intonation sound সম্পর্কে idea দেবে। Do # 4- Extend Your Answers part 1-এ আপনার ব্যবহার করা উচিত এমন কোন set amount of words বা Sentence নেই। সেগুলি খুব Short হওয়া উচিত নয় কারণ আপনি examiner কে দেখাতে চান যে আপনি আসলে ইংরেজি use করতে পারেন, তাই I’m a student। সত্যিই যথেষ্ট দীর্ঘ নয়। However, সেগুলিও খুব বেশি long হওয়া উচিত নয়, কারণ part 1 টি familiar topic গুলির (family, work, hobbies ইত্যাদি) উপর হয় এবং যখন কেউ আপনাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করে যে ‘Where are you from? আপনি generally 2 মিনিট ধরে কথা বলেন না। এছাড়াও, part 2 এবং 3-এ long answer দেওয়ার জন্য আপনার অনেক opportunity থাকবে। Do # 5- Practice এই বিষয়টা খুবই খারাপ যে আপনি speaking test এর আগে answer মুখস্থ করেন, কিন্তু part 1 খুবই predictable, তাই উপরে number#1 এ উল্লিখিত familiar topic গুলি practice করা উচিত। নিজের কণ্ঠস্বর record করার চেষ্টা করুন এবং তারপরে শুনুন এবং নিম্নলিখিতগুলি সম্পর্কে চিন্তা করুন: আপনি কি vocabulary বিষয়ে improve করতে পেরেছেন ? আপনি কি কোন grammatical mistake করেছেন যা সংশোধন করতে হবে? আপনি কি fluently কথা বলেছেন বা আপনি কি unnatural speed এ কথা বলেছেন? আপনার intonation কেমন ছিল? আপনি আপনার answer যথেষ্ট extend করতে পেরেছেন? আপনি কি clearly কথা বলতে পেরেছেন? আবার try করুন এবং practice চালিয়ে যান যতক্ষণ না আপনি common topics গুলো সম্পর্কে কথা বলার বিষয়ে সত্যিই confident হোন। Idea র জন্য part 1 এ sample answer এর জন্য আমার article দেখুন। See my article on Part 1 sample answers for ideas. Don’t #1- Give Yes/No Answers এটি খুব obvious শোনাতে পারে, কিন্তু আপনি surprised হবেন যে অনেকে কেবল yes বা no দিয়ে উত্তর দেয়। এটির কারণ হচ্ছে অনেক question naturally ‘yes’ বা ‘no’ উত্তরের দিকে নিয়ে যায়, তবে আপনাকে অবশ্যই মনে রাখতে হবে যে আপনি test দিচ্ছেন এবং আপনাকে examiner কে দেখাতে হবে আপনার English কতটা ভালো। yes বা no উত্তর দেওয়ার কারণে examiner কে আপনার ability judge করতে পারে না এবং আপনার ইংরেজি যত ভালোই হোক না কেন আপনি কম marks পাবেন। অনেকে yes বা no উত্তর দেয় কারণ তারা খুব nervous feel করে এবং তারা চায় যত তাড়াতাড়ি সম্ভব exam শেষ করতে। examiner আপনাকে trick করার জন্য সেখানে stay করে না বরং তাদের বেশিরভাগই ভাল মানুষ যারা চান যে আপনি আপনার সেরা performance টা করেন, তাই তাদের বলতে ভয় পাবেন না যে আপনি কিছুটা nervous এবং এটি আপনার tension কে alleviate করবে। Don’t # 2- Go Off Topic কিছু students কে যখন আপনি তাদের নাম এবং তারা কোথা থেকে এসেছেন তা জিজ্ঞাসা করা হয় তখন তারা তাদের life story বা তাদের শহরের entire history বলার try করে। মনে রাখবেন যে এইগুলি খুব easy question এবং আপনি যদি 3-4টির বেশি sentence দিয়ে থাকেন তবে আপনি সম্ভবত irrelevant information দিচ্ছেন। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, আমি সম্প্রতি একটি ছেলেকে জিজ্ঞাসা করেছি যে ,”What he did in her free time and where is he from? এবং সে আমাকে ব্যাডমিন্টন সম্পর্কে সমস্ত কিছু বলেছে অর্থাৎ নিয়ম,কানুন, ইতিহাস ইত্যাদি যা যা ছিল তা সব বলেছে। আমি rule, history, great players, positive and negative impact of the sport সম্পর্কে জিজ্ঞাসা করিনি, কোন খেলাটি সে পছন্দ করে এবং কেন সেটিই জিজ্ঞাসা করেছিলাম। Don’t # 3- Give No Answer আপনি question টি choose করতে পারবেন না এবং যদি আপনি একটি question এর Answer না জানেন, বা আপনি কেবল question টি পছন্দ না করেন, তবে আপনার কোন alternative option থাকবে না আপনাকে অবশ্যই এটির answer দিতে হবে। মনে রাখবেন যে part 1 about you। এমন কোন question থাকবে না যা আপনি বুঝতে পারবেন না কারণ সেগুলি আপনার সম্পর্কে হবে। আপনি যদি একটি question এর একটি word বুঝতে না পারেন, তাহলে সেই একটি word এর meaning কী তা ব্যাখ্যা করার জন্য Examiner কে জিজ্ঞাসা করা acceptable। Examiner কে question টি repeat করতে বলাও acceptable যদি আপনি তারা যা বলেছেন তা পুরোপুরি বুঝতে না পারেন। however, এই privilege এর অপব্যবহার করবেন না এবং প্রতিটি question এর জন্য এটি ব্যবহার করুন; একেবারে প্রয়োজন হলেই এটি ব্যবহার করুন। আপনার যদি really কোন idea না থাকে, তাহলে Examiner এর সাথে honest থাকুন এবং তাদের বলুন যে আপনি সত্যিই জানেন না এবং তারপর একটি guess করুন। এটি আপনার knowledge test নয়, এটি আপনার English test, তাই আপনি যদি সত্যিই আটকে যান তবে relevant কিছু নিজের মত তৈরি করা সম্পূর্ণরূপে acceptable। Don’t # 4- Speak Very Quietly এটি Examiner এর জন্য সবচেয়ে Annoying বিষয়গুলির মধ্যে একটি কারণ আপনার ইংরেজি যতই ভাল হোক না কেন, তারা যদি আপনাকে শুনতে না পাই, তারা আপনাকে higher score দিবে না। confidence এবং shyness এর সাথে এটির অনেক সম্পর্ক রয়েছে। নিশ্চিত করুন যে আপনি নিচের দিকে তাকিয়ে কথা বলছেন না এবং normal এর চেয়ে একটু loudly কথা বলুন। Examiner মূলত আপনার exam টি record করবে, তাই recording device টি আপনার voice তুলে নিতে যথেষ্ট loudly হতে হবে। নিজে নিজে record করার try করুন এবং এটি আবার play করুন। আপনি যদি নিজেকে clearly শুনতে না পান তাহলে আপনার voice volume আরেকটু বাড়িয়ে দিন। Don’t # 5- Be a Perfectionist Examiner জানেন যে আপনি non-native ভাষায় কথা বলছেন এবং তারা আপনার নিকট থেকে perfection আশা করে না। এমনকি যারা 9 পায় তারা ছোট ছোট ভুল করে, এবং যারা band 7 এবং 8 পায় তারা বেশ কয়েকটি ভুল করে থাকে। আপনি যদি constantly নিখুঁত grammar এবং vocabulary সম্পর্কে চিন্তা করতে থাকেন তবে এটি আপনার fluency এবং pronunciation কে reduce করবে। fluency এবং pronunciation আপনার মার্কগুলির 50% তৈরি করে, তাই নিখুঁত grammar এবং vocabulary এর ব্যবহার করার চেষ্টা করার কোন মানে নেই। কেননা আপনি এখানে ৫০% mark নিয়ে কাজ করছেন। যতটা সম্ভব naturally কথা বলুন, natural speed এ কথা বলার উপর focus করুন এবং clear pronunciation করুন এবং grammar এবং vocabulary নিয়ে নিজে নিজেই কাজ করুন। আমি আশা করি আপনি কি করতে হবে এবং আর কি করা যাবে না তা বুঝতে পেরেছেন। speaking test সম্পর্কে আরও অনেক information এর জন্য, part 1 sample answer সহ , আমার speaking page দেখুন ।",

Do I need to make eye contact? Should I wear specific clothing? #3 সারাক্ষণ ইংরেজি চর্চার মধ্যে নিজেকে যুক্ত রাখুন Speaking Test এ আপনার ability এর সর্বোত্তম পারফর্ম করার জন্য, আপনাকে আপনার পরীক্ষার আগে receiving and producing English এর সাথে পরিচিত হতে হবে। আমরা আপনার IELTS Test এর আগের দিন 24-ঘন্টা ইংরেজি warm-up করার পরামর্শ দেয়। আপনার test এর আগে 24 ঘন্টার জন্য শুধুমাত্র ইংরেজিতে কথা বলা, লিখতে, পড়া এবং শোনা বেছে নেওয়ার try করবেন ফলে আপনি ইংরেজিতে চিন্তা করতে অভ্যস্ত হতে পারবেন। আপনার exam ঘনিয়ে আসার সাথে সাথে আপনি আরও বেশি confident বোধ করবেন। #4 wisely vocabulary ব্যবহারকরুন। IELTS assessment criteria, পড়েন , আপনি দেখতে পাবেন যে IELTS এ বলার জন্য আপনার মোট স্কোরের 25% VOCABULARY তে রয়েছে। অতএব, আপনি এটি সঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার করছেন কিনা তা নিশ্চিত করতে হবে! আমিএরদ্বারাকিবোঝাতেচাই? Speaking Test এ নম্বর কম পাওয়ার সবচেয়ে সাধারন কারণ হল Advanced vocabulary এর ভুলভাবে ব্যবহার করা। band 8 words দিয়ে examiner কে প্রভাবিত করার চেষ্টা করবেন না যা আপনি সম্পূর্ণরূপে বুঝতে পারছেন না – ফলে তারা সরাসরি আপনার ভুলগুলি চিহ্নিত করবে। আপনার vocabulary এর সঠিকভাবে expand করার জন্য আমাদের top 5 টি পরামর্শ হল: Words এরদীর্ঘ list শিখবেননা।এটিআপনার score কে কমিয়ে দিবে IELTS TEST হল একটি Language Test মুখস্থ পরীক্ষা নয়। আপনি word এর দীর্ঘ তালিকা শিখে আপনার language skill উন্নত করতে পারবেন না কারণ আপনি natural conversation তা কীভাবে use করতে হয় কীভাবে সেগুলি পাড়বেন না। তারচেয়ে, appropriately vocabulary ব্যবহার করার বিষয়ে অগ্রাধিকার দেওয়া উচিত। Vocabulary শিখতে সময় নিন। তাড়াহুড়া করার ফলে অনেক ভুল হয়। আপনি যদি সঠিকভাবে একটি word ব্যবহার বা উচ্চারণ করতে না শিখেন এবং speaking test এ এটি repeat করেন, তাহলে examiner আপনাকে mark করবেন এবং আপনার score কমে যাবে। আপনাকে fancy বা complicated word ব্যবহার করতে হবে না।যদি আপনার grammar, pronunciation এবং fluency তে weakness থাকে তবে আপনার speaking এ high-level word গুলি prepare করা আপনার speaking quality কে কখনই উন্নত করবে না। মনে রাখবেন, IELTS TEST এ আপনার preference IELTS Examiner কে প্রভাবিত করা নয়, just তাদের সাথে স্পষ্টভাবে communicate করা। #5 ধৈর্যধরুন আপনার IELTS SPEAKING preparation সম্পর্কে আপনার সবচেয়ে মূল্যবান পাঠগুলির মধ্যে একটি হল যে আপনি দৌড়ানোর আগে আপনাকে হাঁটতেসক্ষম হতে হবে। অন্য কথায়, এটা important যে আপনার ability রাতারাতি improve হবে না এই বিষয়ে আপনি stress এ পড়বেন না। Improving a skill set is a process, not a journey। অতএব, এটির জন্য কিছুটা সময় নেওয়া সম্পূর্ণ স্বাভাবিক। আপনি যদি অধ্যবসায়ী হোন, ধৈর্য ধরেন এবং একটি positive mentality রাখেন, তাহলে আপনার IELTS Speaking এর Preparation কতটা enjoyable হতে পারে এবং effective হতে পারে তা দেখে আপনি surprised হয়ে যাবেন।",

Tension করবেন না। আপনি যদি যথেষ্ট practice করেন তবে আপনি ভাল করবেন ইনশাআল্লাহ্‌। IELTS SPEAKING TEST এ আমি যে সমস্ত জিনিসগুলি মূল্যায়ন করি তার মধ্যে সবচেয়ে comoon সমস্যা হল fluency। Fluency হ ল আপনার noticeable effort বা coherence (সংগতি) হারানো ছাড়াই smoothly (দ্রুত নয়) কথা বলার ক্ষমতা । weak fluency সাধারণত ঘন ঘন স্ব-সংশোধন(self-correction), দ্বিধা(hesitation), বিরতি(pause) বা পুনরাবৃত্তির(repetition) সাথে জড়িত। আপনার fluency উন্নত করতে আপনাকে সাহায্য করার জন্য আমি weak fluency এর সবচেয়ে সাধারণ কারণগুলি চিহ্নিত করব এবং তারপরে তাদের প্রতিটিকে কীভাবে উন্নত করা যায় তা দেখব। আপনার fluency improve করতে সাহায্য করার জন্য আপনি প্রতিদিন কী করতে পারেন তাও আমরা আলোচনা করব। Problem # 1- খুব দ্রুত কথা বলার চেষ্টা করা আমি উপরে উল্লেখ করেছি, student with good fluent রা কথা বলে fluently, quickly নয়। এটি একটি common mistake যে good fluency মানে খুব দ্রুত কথা বলা। যদি আপনি Native Speaker দের কথা শুনতে পারেন যে তারা কীভাবে কথা বলে, তাহলে দেখবেন যে তারা সাধারণত খুব দ্রুত কথা বলে না। রেডিও, খবর বা চলচ্চিত্রে native speaker দের কথা শুনুন এবং এটি আপনাকে তারা কত দ্রুত কথা বলে সে সম্পর্কে একটি ভাল ধারণা দেবে। যেকোন ভাষায় খুব দ্রুত কথা বলার চেষ্টা করলে coherence বা সুসংগততা নষ্ট হবে কারণ আপনার brain আপনার মুখের সাথে তাল মিলিয়ে চলতে পারে না। test এর সময় quickly কথা বলা এবং coherence এর সমস্যা থাকলে আপনার test ভাল হবে না। Solution – calmly এবং smoothly কথা বলার উপর focus করুন। স্থানীয় Native Speaker দের কথা শুনুন এবং তাদের কথা বলার গতি copy করার try করুন। এটি শুধুমাত্র আপনার fluency improve করতে সাহায্য করবে না, আপনাকে idea গুলি চিন্তা করতে এবং সঠিক grammar এবং vocabulary খুঁজে পেতে আর সাহায্য করবে। Problem # 2- Idea নিয়ে চিন্তা করার Try করা Student রা প্রায়ই অভিযোগ করে যে তারা good বা correct idea নিয়ে ভাবতে পারে না এবং এর ফলে তাদের fluency ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হয়। এটি প্রায়শই speaking test এ প্রকৃতপক্ষে কী মূল্যায়ন করা হয় তা সঠিক ভাবে বুঝতে না পারার কারনে ঘটে। আপনি যদি official marking criteria, দিকে তাকান , আপনি লক্ষ্য করবেন যে good ধারণার কোনো উল্লেখ নেই। যতক্ষণ আপনি একটি answer দেবেন যা জিজ্ঞাসা করাপ্রশ্নের সাথে সম্পর্কিত, ততক্ষণ আপনি ভাল করতে থাকবেন। এটি একটি idea test বা intelligent test নয়, এটি একটি speaking test। একটি গণিত পরীক্ষার মতো নয়, কোন সঠিক বা ভুল উত্তর নেই। শুধু examiner আপনার কথা বলার ক্ষমতা দেখেন। সমাধান – আপনার idea এর quality নিয়ে এত চিন্তা করবেন না এবং আপনার speaking এর quality এর দিকে মনোনিবেশ করুন। যে প্রশ্ন আপনাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করা হয়েছে তার সম্পর্কে আপনি কি জানেন সে সম্পর্কে পরীক্ষকের সাথে কথা বলুন। আপনি যদি বিষয় সম্পর্কে কিছুই না জানেন, বা খুব কম, তবে examiner কে বলতে ভয় পাবেন না। পার্ট 1-এ কোনও সমস্যা হবে না কারণ প্রশ্নগুলি আপনার সম্পর্কেই, তাই এর জন্য ধারণাগুলি নিয়ে চিন্তা করতে আপনার কোনও সমস্যা হবে না। পার্ট 3 এর জন্য, কিছু প্রশ্ন কঠিন হবে। আপনাকে কেবল এটি গ্রহণ করতে হবে এবং সেগুলোর যথাসাধ্য answer দেওয়ার চেষ্টা করতে হবে। পার্ট 2 এর জন্য, আপনার একটি structure থাকতে হবে problem # 3- কোন Structure follow নাকরা এই সমস্যাটি বেশিরভাগ part 2 এর সাথে সম্পর্কিত। শিক্ষার্থীদের examiner এর দেওয়া একটি topic সম্পর্কে 2 মিনিট পর্যন্ত কথা বলতে হবে। আপনি কথা বলার আগে আপনাকে একটি cue card দেওয়া হবে, ঠিক নীচের মতো। আপনাকে কথা বলার জন্য একটি general topic দেওয়া হয়েছে এবং তারপরে তিনটি বা চারটি বিষয় রয়েছে যা তারা আপনাকে suggest করছে এবং আপনার কি বলা “উচিত” সেই বিষয়ে কথা বলছে। এখানে সমস্যা হল যে অনেক লোকের বলার মতো জিনিস ফুরিয়ে যায় এবং তারপরে তাদের fluency সাধারণত ক্ষতিগ্রস্থ হয়। এটি দুটি প্রধান কারণে। প্রথমত, অনেকে মনে করেন যে তারা শুধুমাত্র card এ প্রস্তাবিত তিনটি বিষয় সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে সীমাবদ্ধ!!! শুধুমাত্র 2 মিনিটের জন্য তিনটি ছোট বিষয়ে কথা বলা কঠিন। দ্বিতীয়ত, বেশিরভাগ লোকেরা card এর তিনটি জিনিস ছাড়া অন্য কিছু সম্পর্কে কথা বলার জন্য প্রস্তুত থাকে না। Solution আপনাকে অবশ্যই cue card এর top এ থাকা general topic সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে হবে, তবে আপনি সেই topic এর মধ্যে থেকে যা খুশি তা নিয়ে কথা বলতে পারেন। অতএব, আপনি পারেন: topic পরিচয় করিয়ে দিন topic সম্পর্কে আপনার opinion দিন topic এর অতীত, বর্তমান, ভবিষ্যত সম্পর্কে কথা বলুন topic এর একটি description দিন topic সম্পর্কে একটি personal story বলুন আপনি যখন এই জিনিসগুলিকে cue card যে বিষয়ে কথা বলার suggest করে তার সাথে combine করেন, এটি আরও অনেক সম্ভাবনার দ্বার উন্মোচন করে, আপনি কথা বলার আগে 1 মিনিটের planning এর সময় আপনার answer গঠন করেন এবং এটি আপনার কাছে কথা বলার জন্য যথেষ্ট হবে। দুই মিনিটের মধ্যে। এই সম্পর্কে আরও তথ্যের জন্য অনুগ্রহ করে আমার Speaking Part 2 Strategy দেখুন । আপনার part 3 উত্তরগুলি কীভাবে গঠন করবেন সে সম্পর্কে আরও তথ্যের জন্য অনুগ্রহ করে আমার Part 3 Tips দেখুন৷ Problem 4- Grammar এবং Vocabulary তে খুব বেশি focus করা Grammar এবং vocabulary আপনার Scorer 50% এর মধ্যে গণনা করে এবং সেগুলি খুব গুরুত্বপূর্ণ, তবে সেগুলি নিয়ে খুব বেশি চিন্তা করলে coherence কম যাবে। আপনি যদি এগুলোর উপর খুব বেশি focus করেন তবে আপনি gradually সঠিক ভাষা ব্যবহার করার কথা ভাবতে পারবেন না এবং এটি অনেক hesitation এবং pause এর সৃষ্টি করবে। এই first language পদ্ধতিটি প্রায়শই কঠোর স্কুল শিক্ষকদের কারণে হয় যারা speaking capacity এর চেয়ে grammar এবং vocabulary কে অগ্রাধিকার দেন। Solution: দুটি part 2 এর প্রশ্ন খুঁজুন। ফোন বা কম্পিউটার দিয়ে নিজেকে রেকর্ড করুন। Language এর উপর focus করে প্রথম প্রশ্নের উত্তর দিন, নিশ্চিত করুন যে আপনি সমস্ত grammar এবং vocabulary সঠিক পেয়েছেন। grammar এবং vocabulary এর ভুল সম্পর্কে খুব বেশি চিন্তা না করে fluency এর উপর focus করে প্রশ্নের উত্তর দিন।আগে পরে দুটি record করুন…… কোনটি ভাল শোনাচ্ছে? আপনি দ্বিতীয়টিতে আরও language error তৈরি করবেন, তবে আপনার overall performance সম্ভবত আরও ভাল হবে। আপনি যদি এই অনুশীলনটি নিয়মিত করেন তবে আপনি শীঘ্রই শিখতে পারবেন যে আপনার ভাষা দক্ষতার উপর আপনার আরও আস্থা থাকা উচিত ছিল এবং বুঝতে পারবেন যে fluency নিয়েই আপনাকে সত্যিকারের কাজ করতে হবে। Problem # 5- যথেষ্ট Practice না করা অনেক ছাত্রেরই চমৎকার vocabulary এবং grammar এর জ্ঞান আছে, কিন্তু তারা আসলে কখনোই কথা বলার বা লেখার মাধ্যমে এই language ব্যবহার করেনা।এটি এবং pronunciation এবং fluency তে বিশাল সমস্যা সৃষ্টি করে, আপনার স্কোরের 50% এর উপর নির্ভর করে। যেকোনো skill এর মতো, কথা বলার জন্য practice এর প্রয়োজন এবং আপনি খুব বেশি practice না করলে, আপনি higher band score পাবেন না। Students দের জন্য সবচেয়ে বড় সমস্যা হল কথা বলার জন্য অংশীদার খুঁজে না পাওয়া। যাইহোক, আপনি এটি করতে পারেন অনেক উপায় আছে. Solution প্রথম সমাধান হল উপরের problem 4 এর জন্য suggestion use করা। আপনি আপনার নিজের এলাকায় Native English Speaker দের খুঁজে বের করার চেষ্টা করতে পারেন। আপনি যদি একটি বড় শহরে থাকেন, তাহলে সম্ভবত ইংরেজি ভাষাভাষীদের অনেক অনলাইন গ্রুপ আছে যারা আপনার সাথে আপনার ভাষা অনুশীলন করতে চায় এবং আপনি তাদের সাথে ইংরেজি অনুশীলন করতে পারেন। Language exchange experience এর জন্য অগণিত ওয়েবসাইট আছে. আপনি তাদের সাথে আপনার own language অনুশীলন করেন এবং তারা বিনিময়ে আপনার সাথে ইংরেজি অনুশীলন করবে তারা। অবশেষে, অনেক ফেসবুক গ্রুপ রয়েছে যেখানে IELTS শিক্ষার্থীরা একে অপরের সাথে কথা বলার অনুশীলন করে। Here is a link to my group. Problem # 6- ‘Umm’ এবং ‘Ahh’ না করার চেষ্টা করা অনেক ছাত্রই ummm , ahh এবং emmm শব্দগুলিকে poor fluency এর সাথে তৈরি করে। আপনি যদি ঘন ঘন hasitation এ পড়েন এবং এই শব্দগুলি বার বার করেন তবে এটি একটি সমস্যা, মাঝে মাঝে এগুলি তৈরি করা কেবল ঠিক নয়, এটি বরং natural। যেকোন ভাষা শুনুন, এবং তারা স্বাভাবিকভাবেই কারো সাথে চ্যাট করার সময় এই শব্দগুলি তৈরি করে। সমস্যাটি হল যে অনেক শিক্ষার্থী তাদের speaking test এ এই শব্দগুলি না করার বিষয়ে obsess হয়ে পড়ে এবং ফলাফল হল তারা সেগুলি নিয়ে খুব বেশি চিন্তা করে এবং আপনি যখন কথা বলছেন তখন এটি করা সম্পূর্ণ unnatural। এর ফলে fluency কমে যায় এবং এটি আপনার brain এর শক্তির অনেক বেশি অংশ নেয় তার চেয়ে বরং language এবং idea গুলিতে আরও ভাল ব্যবহার করতে পারেন। solution accept করুন যে এই hasitation sound গুলি ঘটবে এবং সেগুলি সম্পূর্ণ স্বাভাবিক এবং গ্রহণযোগ্য। আপনি যদি এগুলি খুব কমই তৈরি করেন তবে চিন্তা করবেন না। আবার, আপনি নিজের কথা রেকর্ড করতে পারেন এবং আপনি কত ঘন ঘন এই শব্দগুলি করেন তা খুঁজে বের করতে পারেন। এটি সম্ভবত আপনার ধারণার চেয়ে অনেক কম। অবশেষে, লোকেরা সাধারণত এই hasitation গুলি করে যখন তারা idea গুলি নিয়ে চিন্তা করে বা language অনুসন্ধান করে। উপরের problem 2 এবং 4 এর সমাধান দেখুন Problem # 7- Stress আপনি যদি আপনার পরীক্ষার সময় খুব nervous feel হয় এবং stress এ থাকেন তবে আপনি স্বাভাবিকের চেয়ে কম fluent হতে চলেছেন আপনি। এমন একজনের কথা চিন্তা করুন যিনি জনসমক্ষে কথা বলছেন যিনি খুব nervous। তাদের fluency কেমন হয় বলেন তো? প্রধান কারণ, আমি মনে করি, লোকেরা তাদের Test এর সময় nervous হয় কারণ তারা মনে করে যে তারা test এর জন্য পুরোপুরি প্রস্তুত নয়। Solution উপরের পরামর্শগুলি অনুসরণ করুন এবং আপনি সম্পূর্ণরূপে prepared এবং confident হবেন।",

      "content_clean": "৭ টি উপায়ে Idioms আপনার IELTS Score কমিয়ে দিতেপারে!! IELTS এ Idioms ব্যবহার করার সময় এই ভুল গুলি এড়িয়ে চলুন: শুধুমাত্র appropriate মনে হলেই কেবল idiom ব্যবহার করুন। Writing Task 1 Academic, Writing Task 2 and formal letters গুলিতে এর ব্যবহার উপযুক্ত নয় কারণ তাদের একটি formal tone প্রয়োজন। Speaking Test এ Idiom এর অতিরিক্ত ব্যবহার করবেন না। আপনি নিজেই বোঝেন না এমন Idiom এর ব্যবহার করবেন না। Idiom গুলিকে incorrectly বলবেন না। Idiom নিয়ে খুব বেশি ভাববেন না। Natural মনে হলেই এগুলি ব্যবহার করুন। আমি সম্ভবত অন্য কোন বিষয়ের চেয়ে Idiom সম্পর্কে বেশি প্রশ্ন জিজ্ঞাসিত হয়। প্রতিদিন আমি যেমন ধরনের প্রশ্ন পাই: Idiom ব্যবহার করলে কি আমার score বাড়বে? আমার কোন idiom গুলো ব্যবহার করা উচিত? Speaking Test এ আমার কয়টি Idiom ব্যবহার করা উচিত? Written test এ কি আমি Idiom ব্যবহার করব? এইগুলো Test এর সবচেয়ে ভুল বোঝার areas এর মধ্যে একটি এবং নীচের কিছু ভুল করা সত্যিই আপনার score কমিয়ে দিতে পারে। নিচে 7 টি উপায় দেওয়া হল যে Idiom গুলি আপনার কথা বলার এবং লেখার score কমাতে পারে। ভুল # 1- Task 1 Academic লেখায় Idiom ব্যবহার করা Academic test এর task 1 এর জন্য আপনাকে data, map বা একটি process বর্ণনা করতে হবে। এর জন্য আপনাকে কখনই idiom ব্যবহার করার প্রয়োজন হবে না কারণ আপনি একটি Academic Report লিখছেন এবং informal phrase ব্যবহার করা appropriate নয়। ভুল # 2- Formal letters এ idiom ব্যবহার করা General Training paper এর task 1 আপনাকে একটি letter লিখতে বলে, যা formal বা informal হতে পারে। একটি informal letter এ Idiom এর ব্যবহার করা ভাল, যতক্ষণ না আপনি সেগুলি সঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার করেন। যাইহোক, একটি formal letter এ Idiom এর ব্যবহার করা সঠিক নয় এবং আপনি Informal tone ব্যবহার করার জন্য marks হারাবেন। ভুল # 3- Writing task 2 এ Idiom এরব্যবহার করা Academic এবং General Training উভয়ের জন্য Task 2 লেখার জন্য আপনাকে Academic Style এ একটি ছোট essay লিখতে হবে। formal letter বা Academic Report এর মতো, এই ধরনের essay লেখার সময় idiom এর মত informal language ব্যবহার করা appropriate নয়। ভুল # 4- Speaking Test এ Idiom এর অত্যধিক ব্যবহার Idiom গুলি speaking test এ ব্যবহার করা যেতে পারে এবং আপনাকে higher score পেতে সাহায্য করতে পারে কারণ আপনি Idiom এর ব্যবহার করছেন, কিন্তু এর মানে এই নয় যে প্রতিটি sentence এ আপনার সেগুলি ব্যবহার করা উচিত। আপনি কত ঘন ঘন এগুলি ব্যবহার করবেন তার কোনও specific rules নেই, তবে Native Speaker রা কীভাবে Idiom ব্যবহার করেন তা আপনার শোনা উচিত। আপনি যদি Native Speaker কথা শোনেন, আপনি যতবার মনে করেন ততবার তারা সেগুলি ব্যবহার করে না। আপনি যদি frequently idiom গুলি ব্যবহার করেন তবে খুব unnatural শোনাবে, আপনি আরও ভুল করবেন এবং আপনি coherence ও হারাতে পারেন কারণ আপনি in fact প্রশ্নের উত্তর দেওয়ার চেয়ে Idiom এর উপর বেশি মনোযোগ দিচ্ছেন। finally, এটি আপনার fluency sufferings এর দিকেও নিয়ে যেতে পারে কারণ আপনি Idiom সম্পর্কে খুব বেশি চিন্তা করছেন এবং আপনি latest idiom টি search করতে থাকবেন ফলে আপনি hasitation এ পড়বেন এবং ঘন ঘন pause দিতে হবে। এখানে এমন একজন student এর উদাহরণ দেওয়া হল যার সাথে আমি কথা বলেছিলাম যে Idiom এর অতিরিক্ত ব্যবহার করেছিল: Me: Where are you from? Student: You will be really over the moon when you visit my hometown, but it often rains cats and dogs. I only go there once in a blue moon. If you go, you will really hit the nail on the head. এটি একটি perfect উদাহরণ, কিন্তু এটি আপনাকে অবাক করবে যে student রা এই ভাবেই বারবার Idiom সন্নিবেশ করার চেষ্টা করে। আবার, কত ঘন ঘন আপনি এগুলি ব্যবহার করবেন তার কোনও নির্দিষ্ট নিয়ম নেই; Native Speaker রা কীভাবে কথা বলে তা শুনুন এবং আপনি শীঘ্রই তাদের যথাযথভাবে কীভাবে ব্যবহার করা উচিত সে সম্পর্কে ধারণা পাবেন। ভুল # 5- আপনি বোঝেন নাএমন Idiom ব্যবহার করা আপনার করা সবচেয়ে খারাপ জিনিসগুলির মধ্যে একটি হল Idiom গুলির list শিখা এবং তারপরে test এ সেগুলি সঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার করার আশা করা। পরীক্ষায় সেগুলি ব্যবহার করার চেষ্টা করার আগে আপনাকে অবশ্যই meaning এবং কীভাবে সেগুলি context এ ব্যবহার করা হয় তা বুঝতে হবে। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, “কোনকিছু খুব কমই করেন” এমন কিছু বর্ণনা করার জন্য একটি সাধারণত Idiom হল ‘once in a blue moon’। test এ, যখন কাউকে জিজ্ঞাসা করে যে তারা কত ঘন ঘন কোনকিছু করে, ছাত্ররা বলে ‘once in a blue moon’এবং তারপরে তারা কীভাবে এই activity টি regularly করে তা বর্ণনা করতে যান ৷ এটি তখন examiner এর কাছে স্পষ্ট যে তারা যে Idiom টি ব্যবহার করেছে তার meaning তারা সত্যিই জানে না এবং এটি তাদের score কমিয়ে দেবে। Idiom শেখার সময়, আপনাকে শিখতে হবে কিভাবে এবং কখন সেগুলি ব্যবহার করা উচিত। এটি করার একটি ভাল উপায় হল Native English Speaker কীভাবে সেগুলি ব্যবহার করে তা শোনার মাধ্যমে এবং আপনি যেকোন Idiom নোট করতে পারেন এবং তারপরে সঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার করার practice করতে পারেন। ভুল # 6- Idiom গুলি Incorrectly বলা কয়েক বছর ধরে ছাত্ররা যে Idiom ব্যবহার করেছে তার মধ্যে রয়েছে: ‘Raining dogs and cats’ ‘Hit the nail with the hammer’ ‘Overjoyed the moon’ ‘Once per moon’ এটি ঘটে যখন আপনি প্রায়শই Idiom গুলি ব্যবহার করার চেষ্টা করেন বা আপনি Idiom গুলির list শিখেন এবং 100% জানার আগে সেগুলি ব্যবহার করার চেষ্টা করেন। 100% নিয়ম অনুসরণ করুন- কোন word বা phrase ব্যবহার করবেন না যদি না আপনি meaning, context, use এবং pronunciation 100% না জানেন। ভুল # 7- Idiom সম্পর্কে খুব বেশি চিন্তা করা আপনি ক্রমাগত Idiom সম্পর্কে চিন্তা করেন কারণ আপনি যতটা সম্ভব আপনার উত্তরগুলিতে সেগুলি ঢোকানোর চেষ্টা করছেন, ফলে আপনার fluency ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হবে। আপনার exam এর চিন্তা করার জন্য আরো বিষয় যথেষ্ট আছে (যেমনঃ idea, developing your answer, grammar, vocabulary, pronuciation ইত্যাদি) এবং আপনি যত বেশি চিন্তা করবেন, তত কম fluent হবেন। যখন Idiom ব্যবহার করা natural তখন শুধুমাত্র ব্যবহার করে আপনার exam কে প্রানবন্ত করুন।",

(আপনি যদি একটি smart phone এ নতুন কোনো feature যোগ করতে পারেন, তাহলে সেটি কী হবে?) আপনি দেখতে পাচ্ছেন, এই question গুলি Part 1 এর Where are you from? এবং What’s your favorite color? মতো questions এর চেয়ে trickier। Part 3-এআপনিযাতে best score করতেপারেনসেইজন্যনীচেকিছু tips দেওয়াহল৷ Don’t try to finish quickly একটি বিদেশী ভাষায় 15 মিনিট পর্যন্ত কথা বলা ক্লান্তিকর। আপনি হয়তো আগের রাতে ভাল করে ঘুমাননি, হইতো আপনি TENSION এ ছিলেন কিংবা সেই দিন আপনি হয়তো অন্যান্য exam ও দিয়েছেন। সহজ কথায়, আপনি ক্লান্ত হয়ে পড়বেন এবং আপনার শরীর চাইবে দ্রুত বাসায় পৌছতে এবং যত তাড়াতাড়ি সম্ভব বিছানায় শুইয়ে ঘুমিয়ে যান। অনেক student খুব short answer দেয় কারণ তারা চায় তাদের test যত তাড়াতাড়ি সম্ভব শেষ হোক। জেনে রাখুন যে examiner আপনাকে question জিজ্ঞাসা করতে থাকবে (এবং পরবর্তীগুলি সম্ভবত আরও কঠিন প্রশ্ন হবে), so, short answer দেওয়ার ভাল হচ্ছে full answer দেওয়া এবং আপনার ability এর best answer করার try করতে হবে। Know that the examiner is trying to stretch you Part 1 আসলেই একটি warm-up এবং part 2 হল একটি monologue, তাই part তে examiner সত্যিকার অর্থে আপনাকে test করবে এবং আপনার language ability কে তারা check করবে৷ মনে রাখা main বিষয় হল যে তারা আপনাকে এমন question জিজ্ঞাসা করবে আপনি যেমন আশা করেছিলেন তেমন answer দিতে পারবেন না। আপনি প্রশ্নের answer না দেওয়া পর্যন্ত তারা often অসুবিধা বাড়িয়ে তুলবে। বিষয়টা এমন না যে তারা cruel হওয়ার try করছে, Examiner দের জন্য best way হচ্ছে just তারা আপনার grammatical structure এবং vocabulary সম্পর্কে আপনার knowledge test করবে। একজন personal trainer বা athletics এর কথা চিন্তা করুন যে একজন athlete কে তাদের সত্যিকারের ability judge করার জন্য বেশি বেশি কঠোর exercise করতে বাধ্য করে।সুতরাং, আপনাকেও প্রচুর practice করতে হবে এবং confidently প্রশ্নের answer দিতে হবে। Don’t be afraid to ask questions কিছু question এর মধ্যে এমন vocabulary থাকবে যা আপনি বুঝতে পারবেন না। তখন আপনি examine কে word এর meaning ব্যাখ্যা করতে বলতে পারেন, কিন্তু আপনি তাদেরকে full sentence এর meaning ব্যাখ্যা করতে বলতে পারবেন না।আপনি তাদেরকে question টি repeat করতেও বলতে পারেন, তারা যা বলেছেন যদি তা আপনি পুরোপুরি বুঝতে না পারেন। kindly করে এই privilege এর অপব্যবহার করবেন না এবং প্রতিটি question এর জন্য এটি ব্যবহার করার try করুন। Always give an answer At least একটি question থাকবে যার answer কীভাবে দেবেন তা আপনার কাছে বোধগম্য হবে না। সবচেয়ে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ জিনিসটি হল অন্তত answer করার জন্য একবার চেষ্টা করুন। আপনি 15 মিনিট ধরে কথা বলছেন এবং একটি question পুরো test এর জন্য আপনার নম্বর কমাতে যাচ্ছে না। however, আপনি করতে পারেন এমন সবচেয়ে worse জিনিস হল এটির answer এর চেষ্টা না করা। আপনার যদি এমন mindset থাকে তবে আপনি নিজেকে আপনার ক্ষমতার সীমার বাইরে ঠেলে দেবেন না। আপনার কোন ধারণা নেই তা স্বীকার করাও বোকামি। শুধু বলুন I’m really not sure about this question, but if I had to answer, I would say . Examiner আরও খুশি হবেন যে আপনি একটি answer দেওয়ার try করেছেন, বরং শুধুমাত্র I don’t know বলে বা blankly তাদের দিকে তাকান (ফলে যা আপনি ভাবেন তার চেয়ে বেশি নেতিবাচক প্রভাব ঘটে)।আপনি That a difficult question, just give me a second to think about that. বলে question টি নিয়ে চিন্তা করার জন্য নিজেকে সময় নিতে পারেন। অথবা I’ve never thought about that, to be honest, give me a moment. যাইহোক, প্রতিটি question এর জন্য এটি করবেন না, শুধুমাত্র যেগুলি সম্পর্কে আপনাকে ভাবতে হবে এমন question এর ক্ষেত্রেই করবেন। Think about what structure the examiner is testing. Examiner কে জানাতে হবে যে আপনি wide range of structure ব্যবহার করতে সক্ষম। আপনার answer গুলিতে যতটা সম্ভব structure insert করার বিষয়ে চিন্তা করবেন না কারণ তারা specific grammar structure পরীক্ষা করার জন্য আপনাকে specific question করবে। আসুন নিচের উদাহরণগুলি দেখি: How have mobile phones changed the types of relationships people make? – opinion/past/presentSome people think that children should not be allowed to use mobiles, do you agree? evaluating someone’s opinionHow has mobile phone use changed in the last 10 years. past to present (perfect tenses)How will mobile phones change in the future? future/predictionIf you could add any new feature to a smart phone, what would it be? hypothetical আপনি যখন জানতে পারবেন যে examiner আপনাকে কোন বিষয়ে test করার try করছেন, তখন আপনি সহজেই তাদের answer দিতে পারবেন। test এর সাধারণত common structure সম্পর্কে আরও information এর জন্য আমাদের part 3 এর common question গুলো দেখুন।",

      "content_clean": "IELTS Speaking Part 2 Strategy ‘Introduction , past , description , opinion এবং future heading এর অধীনে note তৈরি করুন। সঠিক tense এবং vocabulary ব্যবহার করুন। আপনি যে বিষয়ে comfort feel করেন সে সম্পর্কে কথা বলুন – আপনাকে card এ যা আছে তার সবকিছু cover করতে হবে না। Confident হতে হবে! আপনি যদি কোন কিছু repeat করতে বলেন, তবে শুধু জিজ্ঞাসা করুন। বাড়িতে এই structure অনুশীলন করুন। official question খুঁজুন এবং আপনার skill improve করুন। এই post টি আপনাকে IELTS speaking test part এর 2 এ আরও ভালোভাবে Answer দিতে সাহায্য করবে। IELTS speaking part 2- তেও আপনাকে একটি topic বা cue card দেওয়া হবে। যেমন: Describe a plant grown in your country. You should say: – what the plant is – where it is grown – why you like or dislike it and explain why it is important to your country. Note তৈরি করার জন্য আপনার 1 মিনিট সময় বরাদ্দ থাকবে এবং তারপরে 1-2 মিনিটের মধ্যে speaking শুরু করতে বলবে। একটি unfamiliar topic এ 2 মিনিটের জন্য কথা বলা বেশিরভাগ IELTS student দের anxiety এর কারণ হয় এবং সেই কারণে IELTS speaking part 2 মূলত test এর সবচেয়ে difficult part গুলির মধ্যে একটি। সমস্যা হচ্ছে cue card এর unfamiliar topic এ কথা বলার সময় মনে হয় “এই বুঝি কথা শেষ হয়ে গেল!!” এই problem টি কাটিয়ে উঠার জন্য, আমি student দের জন্য একটি strategy তৈরি করেছি এবং এটি অত্যন্ত successful বলে প্রমাণিত হয়েছে। একটি common error হল অনেকে মনে করে যে card এ ঠিক যা লেখা আছে তা নিয়ে আপনাকে কথা বলতে হবে। অনেক IELTS examiner এবং student দের সাথে কথা বলেছি যারা তাদের speaking test এ খুব high marks অর্জন করেছে, সুতরাং আমি আপনাকে ensure করতে পারি যে আপনার card এ যা থাকবে তার সবকিছু cover করতে হবে না। band descriptor রাও task 2 এর সমস্ত suggested part গুলো Answer দেওয়ার বিষয়ে কিছু উল্লেখ করেন নি। Card এ suggested sentence গুলি follow করা ভাল এবং অনেক candidate খুব ভালভাবে সেগুলি follow করেন তবে অনেকের কথা বলার idea শেষ হয়ে যায়। আরও একটি important বিষয় হল, যদি প্রতিটি question এর জন্য follow করার জন্য আপনার যদি একটি specific structure maintain করেন তবে আপনি practice করতে এবং আরও efficiently প্রস্তুতি নিতে পারবেন। আমার strategy হল আপনি যে topic এ কথা বলতে comfort feel করেন তা নিয়ে কথা বলা। অন্য দিকে, আপনি যে topic এ highest marks পাবেন বলে মনে করেন সেগুলি সম্পর্কে কথা বলুন। আপনি যদি card এর suggest topic গুলি পছন্দ করেন তবে সেগুলি সম্পর্কে কথা বলুন। কিন্তু আপনি যদি তা না করেন বা আপনি কিছু অতিরিক্ত জিনিস সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে চান, তাহলে নিচের strategy টি অনুসরণ করুন। আপনি যখন cue card পাবেন তখন আপনাকে কিছু idea লিখতে এক মিনিট সময় দেওয়া হবে। আপনি নিম্নলিখিত structure ব্যবহার করে wisely সময় কাজে লাগাতে পারেন। প্রদত্ত কাগজের টুকরোটিতে প্রতিটির মধ্যে সামান্য ফাঁক দিয়ে পাঁচটি heading লিখুন: Introduction Past Description Opinion Future এখন আপনি এই প্রতিটি heading এর পাশে keyword লিখতে শুরু করবেন। নিচে বিষয়গুলো IN DETAIL দেখার try করি। Introduction I’d like to talk about (X) বলে কথা শুরু করুন। তারপর বলুন I chose this topic because এবং আপনি বলতে পারবেন কেন আপনি এই বিষয়টি chose নিয়েছেন। আপনি যদি কোনও reason সম্পর্কে চিন্তা করতে না পারেন তবে কেবল একটি বিষয়েই কথা বলুন, যদিও real experience সম্পর্কে কথা বলা সবসময় ভাল। Past কথার মাঝে pause দিন এবং past সম্পর্কে কথা বলার জন্য anyway বা anyhow -এর মতো linking word ব্যবহার করুন। এতে করে examiner বুঝবে যে আপনি past এর বিভিন্ন structure ব্যবহার করতে বেশ confident। for example- Past এর habit বা এখন সমাপ্ত অবস্থা সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে used to + infinitive- ব্যবহৃত হয়। Past এর habit বর্ণনা করার জন্য would + infinitive। Past এ আপনি যা করেন না বা আর সত্য নয় সে সম্পর্কে কথা বলার জন্য past simple tense বসে। একটি গল্পের background বা একটি নির্দিষ্ট সময়ে আপনার feelings সম্পর্কে কথা বলার জন্য past continuous tense বসে। অতীতে অন্য কিছুর আগে কোন কিছু ঘটেছে বলার জন্য past perfect tense বসে। Description এখন pause দিন এবং বলুন So let me tell about (X) in a little more detail। এই ধরণের words দিয়ে examiner কে impress করতে পারেন। common topic গুলি জানুন এবং কিছু নির্দিষ্ট adjective প্রস্তুত করুন। আপনি যদি কিছু describe করার জন্য adjective ব্যবহার করেন তবে নিশ্চিত করুন যে আপনি এটিকে expand করেছেন বা examples সহ explain করছেন। আবার, আপনি যদি specific example এর কথা ভাবতে না পারেন, তবে এইগুলি দিয়েই কথা বলা ভাল। ensure করুন যে আপনার example গুলি adjective এর সাথে মেলে এবং আপনি এভাবে ভাল করবেন ইনশাআল্লাহ। opinion এখন আপনি pause দিয়ে বলতে পারেন if you ask me/In my view/I would say +(opinion on topic)। এটি আপনাকে topic টি সম্পর্কে আপনার feelings express করার একটি সুযোগ দিবে। এটি আপনার personal opinion হতে পারে বা এটি comparative বা superlative হতে পারে। আপনার opinion প্রকাশের জন্য a wide range of phrase ব্যবহার করা আপনাকে high marks পেতে সাহায্য করবে। আপনি যদি strong opinion দিতে চান তবে আপনি বলতে পারেন: I strongly believe that… As far as I’m concerned… I’m strongly against… I’m strongly in favor of…. I’m skeptical of the idea that… I must admit, I think…. Future অবশেষে আপনি future Tense ব্যবহার করার আপনার ability দেখাতে পারেন। with regards to the future বলে শুরু করুন।A range of tense আপনাকে extra marks পেতে সাহায্য করবে। for example, আপনি ব্যবহার করতে পারেন: Fixed arrangement সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে present continuous Tense হবে। Future plan সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে be going + to + infinitive বসে। opinion বা experience এর উপর ভিত্তি করে prediction করার জন্য will or won’t + infinitive ব্যবহার করা হয়। এটি hope এবং assumption সম্পর্কে কথা বলতেও ব্যবহার করা যেতে পারে। The future perfect- will have + past participle- future এর certain point এ কিছু ঘটবে বা সম্পন্ন হবে বলতে ব্যবহৃত হয়। কত সহজ !!! পাঁচটি সহজ headings যা আপনাকে কোন অসুবিধা ছাড়াই at least দুই মিনিট কথা বলার সুযোগ করে দিবে। সবচেয়ে important বিষয় হল আপনি বিভিন্ন topic এর সাথে এই strategy টি ব্যবহার করেন এবং practice করেন। কিছু আগের IELTS speaking part 2 এর প্রশ্ন দেখুন এবং practice করুন। আপনাকে prepare করার জন্য আপনি এই post টি ব্যবহার করে ধীরে ধীরে practice শুরু করতে পারেন, তবে অনেক practice এর পরে, এই strategy টি আপনাকে used to করে তুলবে এবং আপনি আত্মবিশ্বাসের সাথে যেকোন অংশ question 2 এর answer দিতে সক্ষম হবেন। আপনি যে IELTS BAND টি পেতে চান তা পাওয়ার জন্য কোনও magic formula বা trick নেই তবে এমন ভাল strategy রয়েছে যা আপনি use করতে পারেন এবং আরও গুরুত্বপূর্ণ, strategy গুলি আপনাকে practice এ ব্যবহার করতে পারেন যা আপনার efficiency ক increase করবে। এখানে একটি IELTS speaking task 2 এর question রয়েছে। এই question এর সাথে উপরের strategy টি ব্যবহার করার try করুন: Question: Describe a teacher that you know. You should say: what the teacher looks like what sort of person this teacher is what the teacher helped you to learn and explain why this teacher is popular. মনে রাখবেন, Teacher এর চেহারা কেমন, তার ব্যক্তিত্ব কেমন, Teacher কেন জনপ্রিয়, কোনকিছু শিখতে বা explain করতে teacher আপনাকে কীভাবে সাহায্য করেছেন ইত্যাদি বিষয়েই আপনাকে কথা বলতে হবে এমন নয়। আপনি এই বিষয়গুলি সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে পারেন তবে আপনাকে এটি করতে না পারলে যে বিষয়ে কথা বলতে সবচেয়ে বেশি confident বোধ করেন তা নিয়েই কথা চালিয়ে যান। আমার strategy এর সাথে আপনাকে যা করতে হবে তা হল এই বিষয়ে কথা বলতে নিচের বিষয়গুলো খেয়াল রাখবেন : Introduction Past Description Opinion Future Examples strategy টি ব্যবহার করেছে এমন একজন student এর উদাহরণ এখানেঃ লিঙ্কঃhttps://soundcloud.com/dvantage/wednesday-11-51am?utm_source=clipboard utm_campaign=wtshare utm_medium=widget utm_content=https%253A%252F%252Fsoundcloud.com%252Fdvantage%252Fwednesday-11-51-am",

      "content_clean": "IELTS Speaking Part 2 Tips অনেকে speaking part 2 কে IELTS speaking test এর সবচেয়ে difficult part বলে মনে করেন কারণ এটি একটি monologue। monologue হচ্ছে যেখানে একক ব্যক্তি কথা বলে। monologue পরীক্ষার বাকি অংশ থেকে আলাদা কারণ আপনি একা কথা বলবেন, কোনো question বা examiner এর সাহায্য ছাড়াই। Examiner আপনাকে নীচেরটির মতো একটি Cue Card দেবেন: উপরে উল্লেখিত instruction অনুযায়ী, আপনি কথা বলার আগে আপনার preparation এর জন্য 1 মিনিট সময় পাবেন এবং আপনি 1-2 মিনিটের মত সময় কথা বলবেন বলে expect করা হয়। 1.You Don’t Have to Talk About Every Bullet Point Speaking test এর জন্য Official Marking Criteria (https://www.ielts.org/-/media/pdfs/speaking-band-descriptors.ashx?la=en) তে এমন কিছু নেই যা বলে যে আপনাকে প্রতিটি bullet point সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে হবে। অনেক IELTS Examiner রা এটি জানেন, কিন্তু তারা student দের বলেন না কারণ তারা তাদের unfair advantage দিতে চান না। Test এর শুরুতে আপনাকে সর্বদা একটি general topic দেওয়া হবে এবং তারপরে you should say এর পরে 3-4টি bullet point দেওয়া হবে। নিয়মটি হল যে আপনাকে অবশ্যই card এর top এ যেসব general topic থাকবে সেইগুলো সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে হবে, so, আপনাকে সমস্ত bullet point সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে হবে না। মনে রাখবেন যে এটি you must say নয় you should say এর প্রতি নির্দেশনা দেয়। Bullet point গুলি আপনাকে help করার জন্য দিয়েছে, তাই আপনি যদি সেগুলি সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে চান তবে সেই বিষয় গুলো নিয়েই কথা বলুন৷ however, যদি এমন একটি বা দুটি topic থাকে যা আপনি পছন্দ করেন না বা আপনি কথা বলতে comford feel করেন না, সেগুলি ছেড়ে দিন এবং অন্য কিছু নিয়ে কথা বলুন। নিশ্চিত করুন যে, আপনি যে বিষয়ে কথা বলছেন তা general topic এর মধ্যে রয়েছে এবং আপনি সেই topic এ effectively এবং fluently বলতে পেরে। 2.Have a Strategy IELTS অনেক সহজ যদি আপনার test এর প্রতিটি part এর জন্য একটি strategy থাকে। আপনি যখন practice করছেন তখন আপনি এই strategy টি ব্যবহার করতে পারেন এবং তারপরে আপনি real test এ অনেক বেশি confident হবেন। 3.Preparation তারা বলে practice makes the test perfect এবং এটি IELTS SPEAKING এর জন্য খুব true। উত্তর মুখস্থ করবেন না। আপনার মুখস্থ করার জন্য অনেক topics রয়েছে এবং real test এ আপনি same topic পাওয়ার সম্ভাবনা খুব কম। এটি complete waste of time এবং মুখস্থ করলে answer গুলো কিছু strange হয় যদি Examiner এটি দেখেন, তাহলে তারা আপনাকে Band 0 দিতে পারেন! fluency এবং pronunciation এর প্রতি মনোযোগ দিন। নিজেকে speaking record করুন এবং নিজের speaking record থেকে শুনুন। try করুন কিভাবে আপনি আপনার fluency এবং pronunciation উন্নত করা যায়। common grammar ব্যবহার করে functional language শিখুন , যেমন past, present বা future সম্পর্কে কথা বলা, আপনার opinion দেওয়া, কারো opinion evaluation করা এবং hypothetical talking করা। নিজের timing এর বিষয়ে test করুন যাতে আপনি বুঝতে পারেন যে 1-2 মিনিটের মধ্যে আপনাকে কতটা কথা বলতে হবে। 4.Use 1 Minute Wisely আপনি কথা বলা শুরু করার আগে আপনার preparation এর জন্য এক মিনিট থাকবে। full sentence লেখার জন্য আপনার enough time থাকবে না। তবে, আপনি keyword লিখতে সক্ষম হবেন। এই keyword গুলি আপনাকে আপনার কথা বলার সময় আপনাকে guide করবে এবং আপনি যদি কথা বলার idea হারিয়ে ফেলেন তখন এই keyword গুলো আপনাকে talk continue রাখতে সাহায্য করবে৷ কোন Strategy নির্ধারণ করলে আপনার জন্য সহায়ক হবে কারণ আপনি ঠিক কী বিষয়ে কথা বলতে হবে তা জানতে পারবেন এবং আপনি ছোট notes এবং keywords ব্যবহার করে একটি clear ideal plan করতে সক্ষম হবেন। 5.Personal Experiences Are Best (but telling a lie is OK too.) Best Answer গুলি সর্বদা এমন জিনিসগুলি সম্পর্কে হয় যা আপনি আপনার real life এ experienced করেছেন। আপনি এই জিনিসগুলিকে আরও details বর্ণনা করতে পারবেন এবং আপনি সেগুলি সম্পর্কে আরও coherently কথা বলতে সক্ষম হবেন। student রা real life experience সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে আরও confident হতে থাকে এবং এটি তাদের fluency এবং pronunciation এ সহায়তা করে। However, কিছু cue card আপনাকে এমন জিনিসগুলি সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে বলবে যা আপনি আপনার entire life এ একেবারেই experience করেননি। এইসব ক্ষেত্রে আপনাকে hypothetically বা বানিয়ে answer দিতে হবে। examiner কখনই আপনার answer গুলি check করবেন না বা সেগুলি সত্য কিনা তা নিয়ে চিন্তা করবেন না। যাইহোক, তারা আপনাকে কিছু follow-up question জিজ্ঞাসা করতে পারে, তাই এগুলোর জন্য প্রস্তুত থাকুন। আমার অভিজ্ঞতায়, best strategy হ ল প্রথমে real life experience গুলি ব্যবহার করা এবং whole question এর answer দিতে সহায়তা করার জন্য কিছু hypothetical বিষয় যোগ করা। আপনার imagination ব্যবহার করুন এবং তাহলে আপনি ভাল করবেন ইনশাআল্লাহ। 6.Expand Your Ideas প্রতিটি main idea কে fully expand করা অনেক ভালো, কেবল lots of main idea গুলি বর্ণনা করার চেয়ে৷ এটি আপনাকে আরও impressive answer দিতে সাহায্য করবে এবং আপনি time এর better use করতে পারবেন৷ কয়েকটি relevant idea নিয়ে চিন্তা করা এবং সেগুলি develop করা অনেক সহজ, অনেকগুলি different idea নিয়ে ভাবার চেয়ে। আপনি যখন practice করবেন, তখন আপনার main idea গুলি extend করার একটি ভাল উপায় হল who, what, why, where, how ব্যবহার করা। এটি আপনাকে দ্রুত এবং সহজে আপনার main idea গুলি develop করতে সহায়তা করবে এবং আপনি এটি করার জন্য প্রয়োজনীয় grammar structure এ অভ্যস্ত হয়ে উঠবেন। Wide range of vocabulary ব্যবহার করার জন্য আপনি আপনার 5 senses এর ব্যবহার করতে পারেন। জিনিসগুলি দেখতে, শব্দ, গন্ধ এবং স্বাদ কেমন ছিল সে সম্পর্কে চিন্তা করুন। আপনি স্পষ্টতই প্রতিটি topic এর জন্য এই সমস্ত জিনিসগুলি সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে সক্ষম হবেন না (একটি বই কেমন স্বাদ হয়েছে তা বর্ণনা করা কিছুটা অদ্ভুত শোনাবে) তবে আপনি সাধারণত দুটি বা তিনটি ব্যবহার করতে সক্ষম হবেন৷ practice করার সময় আপনি dictionary ব্যবহার করতে পারেন এই sensation গুলো বর্ণনা করতে এবং আপনার vocabulary expand করতে। 7.Mistakes are OK প্রত্যেকেই grammar এবং vocabulary তে ভুল করে। যতবারই আমি একটি নতুন ভিডিও তৈরি করি, video record করার চেয়ে ভুলগুলি edit করতে আমার বেশি সময় লাগে। এমনকি যে ছাত্ররা band 8 বা এমনকি 9 পায় তারাও ছোট ভুল করে।সুতরাং আপনি যখন ভুল করেন তখন আপনার panic হওয়া উচিত নয়। আমি এমন student দের কথা শুনেছি যারা তাদের part 2 question এর মাঝামাঝিতে ছিল এবং তারপর তারা একটি ছোট grammartical error করেছিল এবং তারা সম্পূর্ণভাবে তাদের track হারিয়ে ফেলেছিল এবং তাদের score খুব high থেকে খুব average এ নেমে এসেছিল। Nervous এবং stressed হওয়া আপনার idea, pronunciation, fluency কে প্রভাবিত করে এবং সাধারণত আরও grammatical error এর দিকে নিয়ে যায়। আপনি যখন ভুল করেন তখন এটি সম্পর্কে ভুলে যান। এখানে আপনার কিছু করার মত নেই। panic হবেন না এবং carry on.

      "content_clean": "IELTS Speaking Part 3 Common Questions এই post টি আপনাকে 7 টি common question type সম্পর্কে ধারনা দিবে এবং আমরা talk করার জন্য যে language ব্যবহার করি তা শিখে IELTS Speaking test এর জন্য প্রস্তুতি নিতে help করবে। IELTS speaking part 3 সাধারণত 4-5 মিনিট স্থায়ী হয় এবং পরীক্ষক আপনাকে part 2 এর সাথে related question জিজ্ঞাসা করার অনুমতি দেয়। conversation টি আরও general এবং abstract হয় এবং আপনি part 1-এর তুলনায় আরও deeply উত্তর দেবেন বলে expect করা হয়। অনেক student part 3 কে ভয় পায় কারণ তারা জানে না examiner তাদের কাছে কি expect করবে। এই supposed unpredictability ছাত্রদের যেমনটা করা উচিত তেমনটা না করতে obstruct করে। fortunately, question গুলির একটি quick analysis থেকে বুঝা যায় এর 7টি common question type রয়েছে এবং এটি student দের grammatical structure এবং phrase গুলি সম্পর্কে কথা বলার জন্য ব্যবহার করার বিষয়ে help করে। This post will: 7 টি common question type প্রতিটি question type এর উত্তর দিতে ব্যবহৃত grammatical structure; Example answer। 7 Common Question Type: IELTS speaking part 3 এ যে 7 common question type দেখা যায় তা হল: opinion – what do you think about this? আপনি কেন এমন ভাবেন তা বলতে ভুলবেন না এবং example দিন। evaluate – আপনি অন্য কারো opinion সম্পর্কে কি মনে করেন? future – future এ কী ঘটবে বলে আপনি মনে করেন? Cause and effect কী কারণে এটি হয়েছে and/or এটির কী প্রভাব রয়েছে? Hypothetical – imaginary বা unreal situation সম্পর্কে কথা বলুন। Compare and contrast দুটি জিনিসের মধ্যে difference and/or similarities সম্পর্কে কথা বলুন। Past – past এ জিনিসগুলি কীভাবে different ছিল এবং কীভাবে তারা change হয়েছে? Grammatical Structure Opinion আপনার একটা কাজ করা উচিত না তা হল I think বা In my opinion দিয়ে প্রতিটি sentence শুরু করা। IELTS examiner আপনার language কীভাবে vary করে তা খেয়াল করবেন। নীচে কয়েকটি উপায় রয়েছে যা অবলম্বন করতে পারেন কথা বলার সময়: As I see it, personally, for me, আপনি যদি কিছু সম্পর্কে খুব strongly feel করেন তবে আপনি use করতে পারেনঃ I’m convinced that… (আমি নিশ্চিত যে ) I’m certain that…… (আমি নিশ্চিত যে ) I’m sure that…… (আমি নিশ্চিত যে….) আপনি যদি আপনার মতামত সম্পর্কে less sure হন তবে আপনি ব্যবহার করে একটি weaker opinion দিতে পারেনঃ I guess that (আমি ভাবতেসি যে…) I suppose that ( আমি অনুমান করি যে….) I’d say that (আমি বলবো যে .) Example Question What are some the ways people can help others in the community? লোকেরা community এর অন্যদের সাহায্য করতে পারেএমন কিছু উপায় কী কী? As I see it, there are many ways one can help the needy, but the best way is by making charitable donations. People can choose a charity and simply donate a sum of money and leave it to them to help others in need. For instance, I recently gave money to an orphanage. I don’t have time to help them personally, so I’ll leave it up to them to use the money as they see fit. (আমি মনে করি , অনেক উপায় আছে যার মাধ্যমে একজন অভাবীকে কেউ সাহায্য করতে পারে, কিন্তু best way হল charitable donation করা। লোকজন একটি দাতব্য সংস্থা বেছে নিতে পারে এবং সহজভাবে কিছু অর্থ দান করতে পারে এবং অন্যদের প্রয়োজনে সাহায্য করার জন্য তাদের কাছে ছেড়ে দিতে পারে। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, আমি সম্প্রতি একটি অনাথ আশ্রমে টাকা দিয়েছি। তাদের ব্যক্তিগতভাবে সাহায্য করার জন্য আমার কাছে সময় নেই, তাই আমি তাদের উপর ছেড়ে দেব যেন তারা উপযুক্ত লোকদের জন্য টাকা ব্যবহার করতে পারে।) Evaluate এই ধরনের question এ আপনাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করা হবে আপনি অন্য কারো opinion সম্পর্কে কি ভাবছেন। তাই আমাদের এমন expressions ব্যবহার করতে হবে যা আমাদেরকে agree বা disagree করবে। Agreement এর জন্য আমরা ব্যবহার করতে পারিঃ I couldn’t agree with you more. That’s so true. That’s for sure. That’s exactly how I feel. No doubt about it. I suppose so./I guess so. You/they have a point there. Disagreement জন্য আমরা ব্যবহার করতে পারিঃ I don’t think so. I’m afraid I disagree. I totally disagree. I beg to differ. I’d say the exact opposite. Not necessarily. That’s not always true. That’s not always the case. মনে রাখবেন যে আপনাকে explanations এবং examples সহ আপনার answer গুলি extend করতে হবে। Example Question Some people say that people helped others more in the past than they do now. Do you agree or disagree? I don’t think so. When it comes to my parents’ generation I think they are quite sceptical about helping other people in the community, but my generation are regularly doing things to improve it, such as volunteering for various environmental and charitable organizations. Young people are actively encouraged to help out in the community and I don’t think this happened in the past, so I’m afraid I’d disagree. (আমি তা মনেকরি না। যখন আমার পিতামাতার প্রজন্মের কথা আসে তখন আমি মনে করি তারা community এর অন্যান্য লোকেদের সাহায্য করার বিষয়ে যথেষ্ট sceptical, কিন্তু আমার প্রজন্ম নিয়মিতভাবে এটিকে improve করার জন্য কিছু করছে, যেমন বিভিন্ন পরিবেশগত এবং দাতব্য সংস্থার জন্য volunteering কাজ করা। তরুণদের সক্রিয়ভাবে কমিউনিটির সাহায্য করার জন্য উত্সাহিত করা হয় এবং আমি মনেকরি না যে এটি অতীতে ঘটেছে, তাই আমি ভয় পাচ্ছি যে আমি একমত হব না।) Future আপনাকে প্রায়শই predict করতে বলা হয় যে ভবিষ্যতে একটি নির্দিষ্ট বিষয় কীভাবে change হবে। ভবিষ্যতের predict করার জন্য আমরা সাধারণত will + verb ব্যবহার করি, তবে এটি বেশ সহজ এবং Examiner ভবিষ্যতের predict করার জন্য আরও complicated structure ব্যবহার করার ability খুঁজবেন। আরও complex structure অন্তর্ভুক্ত করতে পারে: X plans to….. It is predicted that…. X intends to…. I foresee….. It is foreseeable…. Conditionals- If X + verb….. It is likely that… It is probable that…. It is unforeseeable that…. I envisage…. Always আপনাকে explain করতে হবে কেন আপনি মনে করেন যে এটি future এ ঘটবে। আপনি আপনার answer extend করতে future conditional ব্যবহার করতে পারেন। Example Question Some people say that working from home will be quite common in the future. Do you agree? It is foreseeable that more people will work from home in the future. If the internet becomes faster and there are more programs, such as Skype, that allow people to work from home more easily, I’d predict that more people will stay at home. If you think about it, most people don’t need to be physically present to do their jobs and I envisage that face to face meetings will be a thing of the past. (এটা অনুমান করা যায় যে ভবিষ্যতে আরও বেশি লোক বাড়ি থেকে কাজ করবে। যদি ইন্টারনেট faster হয় এবং স্কাইপের মতো আরও প্রোগ্রাম থাকে যা লোকেদের বাড়ি থেকে আরও easily কাজ করার সুযোগ দেয়, আমি predict করব যে আরও বেশি লোক বাড়িতে থাকবে। আপনি যদি এটি সম্পর্কে চিন্তা করেন, বেশিরভাগ লোকের তাদের কাজ করার জন্য physically উপস্থিত থাকার প্রয়োজন নেই এবং আমি মনে করি যে face to face meeting গুলি অতীতের স্মরণীয় বিষয় হবে ।) Cause and Effect You may also be asked to discuss what has caused a certain situation and what effects this has. This language will also help you in IELTS writing task 2. একটি certain situation এর কারণ কী এবং এর কী effect রয়েছে তা নিয়েও আপনাকে discuss করতে বলা হতে পারে। এই language আপনাকে IELTS writing task 2-এও সাহায্য করবে। To talk about cause and effect you can use: …because… …as a result… …resulted in… …as a consequence… …due to…. …caused… …led to…. …means that…. এগুলি just কয়েকটি examples এবং sentence এর চারপাশের word গুলোর উপর depend করে word এর form পরিবর্তিত হতে পারে। আপনি যদি নিশ্চিত হন যে আপনার sentence গুলি grammatically correct তবেই সেগুলি ব্যবহার করুন৷ Example Question How does advertising influence what people choose to buy? লোকেরা যা কিনতে পছন্দ করেতা Advertising কীভাবে influence করে? I think advertising has a big influence on what people purchase and often leads to them always sticking with the same brand. For example, I always drink Coca Cola and I believe this is because I grew up watching all those ads on TV and I instinctively buy it as a result. I mean, why would companies spend so much money on adverts, unless it led to more sales? (আমি মনে করি লোকেরা যা কিনছে তার উপর advertisement এর একটি বড় প্রভাব রয়েছে এবং প্রায়শই তারা একই ব্র্যান্ডের দিকে influence করে। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, আমি always Coca Cola পান করি এবং আমি believe করি কারণ আমি tv তে এই সমস্ত advertisement দেখে বড় হয়েছি এবং ফলস্বরূপ আমি instinctively এটি কিনেছি । আমি বলতে চাচ্ছি, কেন কোম্পানিগুলো বিজ্ঞাপনে এত টাকা খরচ করবে, যদি না এটি আরও বেশি sales এর দিকে পরিচালিত করে?) Hypothetical 2nd conditional টি unreal , unlikely বা impossible situation সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে ব্যবহৃত হয়। আপনাকে unreal situation সম্পর্কে question ask করতে পারে, উদাহরণস্বরূপ আপনি যদি আপনার শহরের মেয়র হতেন, তাহলে আপনি এটির উন্নতি করতে কী করতেন? এর জন্য আমরা যে grammar structure ব্যবহার করি তা হল: If + (subject 1) + past participle, then (subject 2) + would + verb Example Question If you could choose any country to live in, where would you choose? আপনি যদি বসবাসের জন্য কোনো দেশ বেছে নিতে চান, তাহলে আপনি কোন দেশকে বেছে নেবেন? If I could live in any country, I would probably choose Australia. The weather is great; the people are super friendly and just imagine living beside all those beaches. If I could choose another country, it would have to be Italy, for the architecture, the culture and its fascinating history. (যদি আমি যেকোন কোনো দেশে থাকতে পারতাম, আমি সম্ভবত অস্ট্রেলিয়া বেছে নিতাম। আবহাওয়া অসম্ভব সুন্দর; সেখানের লোকেরা খুব friendly এবং সেই সমস্ত সৈকতের পাশে বসবাস করা যাবে এমন imagine করুন। যদি আমি অন্য আরেকটি দেশ choose করতে পারতাম, তবে এটি ইতালি হতো, কেননা সেখানে আছে architecture, culture এবং fascinating history।) Compare and Contrast দুটি জিনিস compare করতে, comparative adjective + than ব্যবহার করুন। যেমন তিনি তার বোনের চেয়ে লম্বা। যেমনঃ He’s taller than his sister. Some comparative adjectives are irregular: Good- better Bad- worse Far- further For short adjectives, add –(e)r. If they end in –y change to –ier. For example: Hard- harder Cheap- cheaper Easy- easier Lazy- lazier For longer adjectives, use more. For example: More interesting More difficult Example QuestionDo you think primary school children should learn a second language or should they wait until secondary school? আপনি কি মনে করেন primary school এর শিশুদের second language শেখা উচিত নাকি secondary school পর্যন্ত wait করা উচিত? It’s obvious that the earlier children start a language the easier it becomes in later life. However, some parents might think that subjects like maths are more important than languages at primary level. They may also think that a foreign language is less important than their first language and this should be prioritized. (এটা obvious যে শিশুরা আগে ভাগেই একটি language শিখতে শুরু করাটা later life এ শুরু করার চেয়ে সহজ। যাইহোক, কিছু guardian মনে করতে পারেন যে maths এর মতো বিষয়গুলি primary level এ language শেখার চেয়ে more important । তারা মনে করতে পারে যে একটি foreign language তাদের first language এর চেয়ে less important এবং এটিকে prioritized করা উচিত।) Past অতীতে শুরু হওয়া এবং বর্তমান অবধি চলতে থাকা কিছু সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে আমরা present perfect continious ব্যবহার করতে পারি। যেমনঃ They have been developing the city centre for the past five years. এই tense এর জন্য আমরা structure ব্যবহার করি has/have + been + present participle (verb-ing)। Past habit বা কেবল সমাপ্ত situation সম্পর্কে কথা বলতে used to + infinitive-এ ব্যবহৃত হয়। Past habit বর্ণনা করার জন্য would + infinitive বসে । অতীতে আপনি যা করেন না বা আর true নয় সে সম্পর্কে কথা বলার জন্য past simple tense ব্যবহার করতে হয়। একটি গল্পের background বা একটি নির্দিষ্ট সময়ে আপনার অনুভূতি সম্পর্কে কথা বলার জন্য past continuous tense ব্যবহার করতে হয়। অতীতে কিছুর আগে কিছু ঘটেছে বলার জন্য past perfect tense ব্যবহার করতে হয়। Example Question How has teaching changed in your country over the past few decades? গত কয়েক দশকে আপনার দেশে শিক্ষার কী change হয়েছে? In the past, teachers simply lectured students and the students just listened to what they said. We were given lots of facts to learn and there was no room for creativity or freedom of expression. I remember learning lots of things without thinking about the theory behind it. Now, there’s been a movement towards students thinking for themselves. (অতীতে, teacher রা কেবল ছাত্রদের জন্য Lecture দিতেন এবং student রা তাদের কথা শুনত যা তারা বলত। আমাদের শেখার জন্য প্রচুর তথ্য দেওয়া হতো এবং creativity বা freedom of expression এর কোন সুযোগ ছিল না। আমার মনে আছে অনেক কিছু শিখেছি এর পেছনের theory নিয়ে চিন্তা না করে। এখন, student দের নিজেদের জন্য thinking করার জন্য একটি movement শুরু হয়েছে ।) For more information on how to answer IELTS part 3 questions please read our IELTS part 3 guide.",

      "content_clean": "Using Idioms in the IELTS Speaking Test অন্য ভাষা শেখার লোকদের থেকে Native Speaker দের আলাদা করার একটি জিনিস হল Idioms এর সঠিক ব্যবহার। the IELTS speaking test, সঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার করলে এগুলি সত্যিই আপনার score বাড়াতে সাহায্য করতে পারে । যাইহোক, যদি আপনি সেগুলি correctly ব্যবহার করতে না পারেন তবে তারা আপনার score কমিয়ে দিতে পারে। Idioms কি? Idioms হল words বা phrase যার common usage এর মাধ্যমে এমন একটি meaning রয়েছে যা words গুলি থেকে স্পষ্ট meaning বুঝা যায় না। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, ‘It’s raining cats and dogs’ এর অর্থ হল প্রবল বৃষ্টি হচ্ছে, কিন্তু আমরা যদি word গুলি দেখি তবে মনে হয় কুকুর এবং বিড়াল আকাশ থেকে পড়ছে। আরেকটি উদাহরণ দেখা যাক। যদি কেউ ‘High as a kite’, হয়, তবে এর meaning এই নয় যে তারা উড়ছে, এর মানে তারা মাদকাসক্ত। Idioms কী বোঝায় তা সত্যিই বোঝার জন্য আমাদের দুটি word বুঝতে হবে literal বা আক্ষরিক এবং metaphorical বা রূপক literal বা আক্ষরিক অর্থ একটি word এর normal বা usual meaning। metaphorical বা রূপক word গুলিকে বর্ণনা করে যা অন্য কিছুর জন্য symbols হিসাবে ব্যবহৃত হয়। এটা literal বা আক্ষরিক এর বিপরীত। তাই high আক্ষরিক অর্থে পৃথিবীর পৃষ্ঠের উপরে অবস্থিত, কিন্তু রূপক অর্থে আপনি ওষুধ গ্রহণ করেছেন এবং তাদের প্রভাব অনুভব করছেন। অতএব, আপনি কেবল word গুলি দেখে idioms এর অর্থ বুঝতে পারবেন না। আপনাকে রূপক বলতে আসলে কী বোঝায় তা খুঁজে বের করতে হবে। আপনি যদি আপনার নিজের মাতৃভাষা সম্পর্কে চিন্তা করেন তবে আমি নিশ্চিত যে আপনি কিছু বাগধারার কথা ভাবতে পারেন যা আপনি সর্বদা ব্যবহার করেন। আমি কি writing বা speaking test এ Idioms এর ব্যবহার করব? Idiom গুলি বেশিরভাগ সময় informally ব্যবহার করা হয় এবং IELTS writing test. ব্যবহার করা উচিত নয় । Spoken English এ সাধারণত Academic writing English এর তুলনায় অনেক কম formal, তাই speaking test এ এগুলি ব্যবহার করা ভাল। তারা কিভাবে আমার score বাড়াতে পারে? উপরের ছবিটি band descriptors for speaking. উপরের 3টি band হল 7, 8 এবং 9। আপনি দেখতে পাচ্ছেন, কিছু inappropriate choice এর সাথেও Idiom ব্যবহার করা একজন band 7 candidate এর জন্য সাধারণত বিষয়। rarely student রা এগুলিকে নিখুঁতভাবে ব্যবহার করে এবং এগুল এমন একজনের জন্য যা 9-এ পৌঁছতে সাহায্য করে। অনেক idiom কি আমার মুখস্থ করা উচিত? একদমই না! এটি IELTS SPEAKING TEST গুলোর মধ্যে সবচেয়ে সাধারণ ভুলগুলির মধ্যে একটি। অনেক শিক্ষার্থী মনে করে যে কেবলমাত্র প্রচুর IDIOM শেখা এবং তারপর Test এ ব্যবহার করা তাদের high score পেতে সাহায্য করবে। আসলে বিষয়টা উল্টো!!! examiner দের Inappropriate Idiom ব্যবহার করার চেষ্টা করা লোকেদের চিহ্নিত করার জন্য trained করানো হয়। এটি CONTEXT এর উপর নির্ভর করে এবং আপনি যদি সেগুলি সঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার না করেন তবে সেগুলি খুব odd এবং unnatural শোনাবে৷ আমি কিভাবে idiom এর effective ব্যবহার করব? আপনার শুধুমাত্র idiom গুলি ব্যবহার করা উচিত যদি আপনি শুনে থাকেন যে সেগুলি real context এ কীভাবে ব্যবহার করা হয় এবং আপনি তখনি ব্যবহার করবেন যখন 100% নিশ্চিত থাকবেন যে যে আপনি সেগুলি সঠিক উপায়ে ব্যবহার করছেন৷ Common Idioms নিচে কিছু সাধারণ Idioms দেওয়া হল যা আমি ছাত্রদের IELTS SPEAKING TEST এ সঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার করতে শুনেছি। আপনি যদি আগে কখনও তাদের কোনটি না শুনে থাকেন তবে সেগুলি কীভাবে ব্যবহার করা হয় তার আরও উদাহরণ খোঁজার চেষ্টা করুন এবং তারপর ইংরেজিতে কথা বলার সময় সেগুলি ব্যবহার করার practice করুন। এছাড়াও, সেগুলো কোথা থেকে এসেছে অর্থাৎ সেগুলোর origin বোঝা আপনাকে সেগুলি মনে রাখতে সাহায্য করতে পারে। আপনি এখানে IELTS SPEAKING TEST নিয়ে আরও সাহায্য পাবেন: IELTS Speaking Practice আপনি যদি পারেন, একজন Native Speaker বা English Teacher কে আপনার কথা শুনান এবং তাদেরকে ask করুন যে আপনি সেগুলি সঠিকভাবে ব্যবহার করছেন কিনা। এগুলোর বেশিরভাগই হল something, someone বা আপনি কেমন অনুভব করেন তা বর্ণনা করার উপায়। এগুলি ব্যবহার করা আরও সহজ কারণ আপনি সাধারণত যে বর্ণনাটি ব্যবহার করবেন তা substitute করতে পারেন। Examples Over the moon– অত্যন্ত খুশি বা খুশি হওয়া। I was over the moon when I passed my speaking test. Once in a blue moon– খুব কমই ঘটে A student will get a 9 in the IELTS writing test once in a blue moon. A piece of cake– খুব সহজ। Getting a band 6 in the speaking test will be a piece of cake. A drop in the ocean– অনেক বড় কিছুর একটি খুব ছোট অংশ। Just learning idioms is a drop in the ocean when it comes to preparing for the speaking test. Actions speak louder than words– কোনকিছু সম্পর্কে কথা বলার চেয়ে তা করা ভাল। Lots of people have great business ideas but do nothing about them. Actions speak louder than words, just do it. Back to the drawing board– যখন আপনি কিছু করার চেষ্টা করে ব্যর্থ হন এবং তখন আবার তা চেষ্টা করতে হবে। I got 4.5 in reading! Oh well, back to the drawing board. Put all your eggs in one basket- আপনার সমস্ত money বা effort একটি জিনিসের মধ্যে রাখুন। Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. You should apply to lots of different universities. The in thing– ফ্যাশনেবল এমন কিছু কে বুঝায় The new iPhone is really the in thing at the moment. The real McCoy– আসল বা জাল নয়। I don’t think her new handbag is the real McCoy. Off the top of my head– প্রথমে চিন্তা না করে কিছু বলা। Off the top of my head, I’d say about 2 or 3. Run of the mill– গড়, সাধারণ (average, ordinary) Apple phones are very run of the mill these days. Soulmate– এমন একজন যাকে আপনি খুব গভীরভাবে trust করেন। My husband is not just my lover, he’s my soul mate. Down in the dumps– sad. I was really down in the dumps after my dog died. Found my feet– কিছু করতে আরামদায়ক feel করা। Moving to a new city was difficult as first, but I soon found my feet. Set in their ways– পরিবর্তন করতে চান না। My parents are quite traditional and set in their ways. Go the extra mile– প্রয়োজনের চেয়ে অনেক বেশি করা। I decided to go the extra mile and move to England to really perfect my English. A hot potato– একটি বিতর্কিত বিষয়। Abortion and capital punishment are hot potatoes in my country at the moment. Miss the boat– একটি সুযোগ মিস। I sent my application in late and I think I missed the boat. Costs an arm and a leg– সত্যিই ব্যয়বহুল। Those shoes must have cost an arm and a leg. Sit on the fence– সিদ্ধান্তহীন পড়া। I haven’t made my mind up about that issue, I’ll have to sit on the fence.",

In the ten hours prior to the Titanic’s fatal collision with an iceberg at 11.40pm, six warnings of icebergs in her path were received by the Titanic’s wireless operators. Only one of these messages was formally posted on the bridge; the others were in various locations across the ship. If the combined information in these messages of iceberg positions had been plotted, the ice field which lay across the Titanic’s path would have been apparent. Instead, the lack of formal procedures for dealing with information from a relatively new piece of technology, the wireless, meant that the danger was not known until too late. This was not the fault of the Titanic crew. Procedures for dealing with warnings received through the wireless had not been formalized across the shipping industry at the time. The fact that the wireless operators were not even Titanic crew, but rather contracted workers from a wireless company, made their role in the ship’s operation quite unclear. i) Faulty design ii) Iceberg locations not plotted iii) Inadequate training সঠিক উত্তর হবে ii, কারণ পুরো প্যাসেজের মূলভাব ছিল আইসবার্গের অস্তিত্ব সম্পর্কে ওয়ার্নিং পাওয়া সত্ত্বেও সেই মেসেজ ঠিকমতো ডেলিভার করা হয়নি। ফলে এই সংঘাত হয়েছিলো। ডেলিভার করলে আইসবার্গের অবস্থান “plot (চিহ্নিত)” করা যেত। আর কেন সঠিকভাবে ডেলিভার করা হয়নি, সে বিষয়েও অনেক কথা বলা হয়েছে। কিন্তু সেটার উপর ভিত্তি করে কোনো হেডিং দেওয়া হয়নি। আপনি যদি মূলভাব না ধরতে পারে, তাহলে “Inadequate training/ Faulty design”-কে সঠিক এন্সার মনে করতে পারেন। কিন্তু দেখুন, প্যারার কোথাও কিন্তু ট্রেনিং বা জাহাজের ডিজাইন সম্পর্কে কিছু বলেনি। ২) true/false/not given: মানুষ সবচেয়ে বেশি সমস্যায় পড়ে false/not given নিয়ে। কোনটা যে false, আর কোনটা যে not given, সেটাই অনেক সময় প্যাঁচ লেগে যায়। মনে রাখবেন, প্যাসেজে যা একদমই বলা হয়নি, সেটা not given হবে। অর্থাৎ not given ইনফরমেশনগুলি আলটপকা বাইরে থেকে এনে প্রশ্নে ঢুকানো হয়। কিন্তু প্রশ্নে অনেক সময় এমনভাবে কিছু মিথ্যা পয়েন্ট উল্লেখ করা হয়, যেটা পড়লে আপনার মনে হবে, প্যাসেজেও এই বিষয়ে লেখা আছে। এগুলোই false। ব্যাপারটা বুঝার জন্য আমি একটা প্যাসেজ দিচ্ছি। পড়ে নিচের পয়েন্টগুলোর মধ্যে কোনটা true/false/not given, বের করুন। When it opened in 1843 the Thames Tunnel was described as the English Wonder of the World. People came from far and wide to see the first tunnel under a river. On the first day, fifty thousand people descended the staircase and paid a penny to walk through the tunnel. By the end of the first three months there were a million people, or half the population of London. This was the most successful visitor attraction in the world. In the age of sail and horse-drawn coaches, people came long distances and bought souvenirs and listened to the entertainment in the cross-tunnel arches. The idea, of course, was not entertainment but to move cargo and turn a profit. 1. People were drawn from all over to see the Thames Tunnel. 2. People were able to travel by sea or land in those days. 3. Statues of the tunnel could be purchased as souvenirs. 4. The aim of building the tunnel was make money as a tourist attraction. এখানে দেখুন, প্রথম প্রশ্নে যা জানতে চাচ্ছে, সেটা প্যাসেজের দ্বিতীয় লাইনে বলে দেওয়া আছে। সুতরাং এটা true । দ্বিতীয় প্রশ্নে যা জানতে চাচ্ছে, সেটা আছে প্যাসেজের ৬ নাম্বার লাইনে। এটাও true । তৃতীয় প্রশ্নে যা জানতে চাচ্ছে, সেটা প্যাসেজের কোথাও উল্লেখ নেই। প্যাসেজে শুধুমাত্র সুভেনিরের কথা বলা আছে। কিন্তু কোথাও বলা নেই, টানেলের মূর্তিগুলোকে সুভেনির হিসেবে কেনা যেত কিনা। টানেলের মূর্তির কথা একেবারে আলটপকা এনে বসিয়ে দেওয়া হয়েছে, Right? তাই এটা not given । এরপর দেখেন চতুর্থ প্রশ্ন। এখানে যা জানতে চাচ্ছে, সেটার সাথে মিল আছে প্যাসেজের শেষ লাইনের। কিন্তু শেষ লাইনে কী বলা আছে? বলা আছে, টানেলটা তৈরি করা হয়েছিলো মালামাল বহনের মাধ্যমে টাকা পয়সা লাভ করার জন্য। কিন্তু প্রশ্নে কথাটাকে ঘুরিয়ে বলা হল, টানেল তৈরির লক্ষ্য ছিল পর্যটক আকর্ষণ করা। তো, কী বুঝলেন? প্রশ্নটা false।",
